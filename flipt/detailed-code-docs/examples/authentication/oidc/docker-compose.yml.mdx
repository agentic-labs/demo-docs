title: "docker-compose.yml"
---

## High-level description
This `docker-compose.yml` file defines a multi-container Docker application for running Flipt with OIDC authentication using Dex as the identity provider. It sets up two services: `dex` for the Dex server and `flipt` for the Flipt server.

## Code Structure
The code defines two services, `dex` and `flipt`, that communicate with each other over the `flipt_network`. The `dex` service uses a configuration file mounted from the host, while the `flipt` service has environment variables set for logging and telemetry.

## Symbols
### `dex`
#### Description
This service defines the Dex identity provider, which handles user authentication for Flipt. It uses the `dexidp/dex:latest` image and runs the `dex serve` command with the configuration file mounted from the host.

#### Inputs
This service does not take explicit inputs.

#### Outputs
- Exposes port `5556` for the Dex UI and API.

#### Internal Logic
The service starts the Dex server and configures it using the `config.yml` file mounted from the host.

### `flipt`
#### Description
This service defines the Flipt server, which provides feature flag management capabilities. It uses the `flipt/flipt:latest` image and runs the `./flipt` command with the `--force-migrate` flag.

#### Inputs
This service does not take explicit inputs.

#### Outputs
- Exposes port `8080` for the Flipt UI and API.

#### Internal Logic
The service starts the Flipt server, forces database migrations, and configures logging and telemetry settings using environment variables.

## Dependencies
- `dexidp/dex:latest` Docker image for the Dex identity provider.
- `flipt/flipt:latest` Docker image for the Flipt server.

## Configuration
- `dex-config.yml`: Configuration file for the Dex server, mounted to `/etc/dex/config.yml` in the container.
- `config.yml`: Configuration file for the Flipt server, mounted to `/etc/flipt/config/default.yml` in the container.
- `FLIPT_LOG_LEVEL`: Environment variable to set the logging level for Flipt (set to `debug`).
- `FLIPT_META_TELEMETRY_ENABLED`: Environment variable to enable or disable telemetry for Flipt (set to `false`).
