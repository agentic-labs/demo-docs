## High-level description
This directory contains examples of how to secure a Flipt instance using various reverse proxy authentication methods. It demonstrates two main approaches: HTTP Basic Authentication and OpenID Connect (OIDC) Authentication with Dex. These examples are designed to help developers implement secure access to their Flipt deployments in different scenarios.

## What does it do?
The examples in this directory showcase different ways to add an authentication layer to a Flipt instance:

1. Basic Authentication:
   - Implements HTTP Basic Authentication using Caddy as a reverse proxy.
   - Users must provide a username and password to access Flipt's UI or API.
   - Caddy handles the authentication before forwarding requests to Flipt.

2. OIDC Authentication with Dex:
   - Sets up a more complex authentication flow using OpenID Connect (OIDC) with Dex as the identity provider.
   - Users are redirected to Dex for authentication when accessing Flipt.
   - After successful authentication, users are granted access to Flipt.
   - Nginx acts as a reverse proxy in this setup.

Both examples use Docker and docker-compose to create easily reproducible environments for testing and learning purposes.

## Key Files
1. Basic Authentication:
   - `docker-compose.yml`: Defines services for Caddy and Flipt.
   - `Caddyfile`: Contains Caddy server configuration for reverse proxy and authentication.

2. OIDC Authentication:
   - `docker-compose.yml`: Orchestrates services for Flipt, Dex, and Nginx.
   - `dex.config.yml`: Configures the Dex identity provider.
   - `flipt.config.yml`: Sets up Flipt's authentication settings.
   - `nginx.conf`: Configures Nginx as a reverse proxy.
   - `features.yml`: Defines example feature flags for Flipt.

## Dependencies
Both examples rely on Docker and docker-compose for containerization and orchestration. Specific dependencies include:

1. Basic Authentication:
   - Caddy (caddy:latest): Reverse proxy and authentication handler.
   - Flipt (flipt/flipt:latest): Feature flag management service.

2. OIDC Authentication:
   - Flipt (flipt/flipt:latest): Feature flag management service.
   - Dex (ghcr.io/dexidp/dex:latest-distroless): OIDC identity provider.
   - Nginx (nginx:alpine): Reverse proxy.

## Configuration
Each example has its own configuration setup:

1. Basic Authentication:
   - Environment variables in `docker-compose.yml`:
     - `HTTP_USERNAME`: Sets the username for basic authentication.
     - `HTTP_PASSWORD_HASH`: Sets the bcrypt hashed password.
     - `FLIPT_LOG_LEVEL`: Controls Flipt's logging verbosity.
     - `FLIPT_META_TELEMETRY_ENABLED`: Enables/disables telemetry.

2. OIDC Authentication:
   - `dex.config.yml`: Configures Dex as an OIDC provider.
   - `flipt.config.yml`: Sets up Flipt's authentication settings.
   - `features.yml`: Defines sample feature flags.
   - `nginx.conf`: Configures Nginx as a reverse proxy.

Key OIDC configuration details:
- Flipt is served at the `/flipt` path.
- OIDC callback URL: `http://localhost:8080/flipt/auth/v1/method/oidc/dex/callback`.
- Sample user in Dex: email "admin@example.com", password "password".

These examples provide developers with practical, ready-to-use configurations for securing Flipt instances, allowing them to choose between simple basic authentication or more advanced OIDC-based authentication depending on their needs.
