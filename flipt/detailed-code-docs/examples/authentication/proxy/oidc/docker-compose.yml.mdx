title: "docker-compose.yml"
---

## High-level description
This `docker-compose.yml` file defines a multi-container Docker application for demonstrating Flipt's OpenID Connect (OIDC) proxy authentication functionality. It sets up three services: `flipt`, `localhost`, and `nginx`.

## Code Structure
The `docker-compose.yml` file uses a YAML configuration to define three services: `flipt`, `localhost`, and `nginx`. These services are interconnected through the `flipt_network` network. The `nginx` service depends on the `flipt` service being healthy.

## Symbols
### `flipt`
#### Description
This service runs the Flipt application using the `flipt/flipt:latest` image. It configures Flipt with environment variables for logging, storage, and telemetry.

#### Inputs
This service uses the following files as input:
* `./features.yml`: Contains Flipt feature flags definitions.
* `./flipt.config.yml`: Provides Flipt configuration settings.
* `./hosts.txt`: Customizes the `/etc/hosts` file inside the container.

#### Internal Logic
The service sets up a health check that pings the `/health` endpoint on port 8080.

### `localhost`
#### Description
This service runs a Dex identity provider using the `ghcr.io/dexidp/dex:latest-distroless` image. It exposes port 5556 for communication.

#### Inputs
This service uses the following file as input:
* `./dex.config.yml`: Provides configuration for the Dex identity provider.

### `nginx`
#### Description
This service runs an Nginx web server using the `nginx:alpine` image. It acts as a reverse proxy, forwarding requests to the Flipt application.

#### Inputs
This service uses the following file as input:
* `./nginx.conf`: Contains Nginx configuration settings.

#### Internal Logic
The service depends on the `flipt` service being healthy before starting.

## Dependencies
This setup depends on the following Docker images:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `flipt/flipt:latest` | Provides the Flipt application. |
| `ghcr.io/dexidp/dex:latest-distroless` | Provides the Dex identity provider. |
| `nginx:alpine` | Provides the Nginx web server. |
