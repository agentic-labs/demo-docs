title: "dex.config.yml"
---

## High-level description
This file, `dex.config.yml`, defines the configuration for a Dex server, which is an OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity provider. The configuration sets up the issuer URL, storage mechanism, web server, static clients, connectors, and enables a password database for authentication.

## Code Structure
This YAML file defines key-value pairs for various configuration options. The top-level keys represent different aspects of the Dex server configuration, such as `issuer`, `storage`, `web`, `staticClients`, `connectors`, `enablePasswordDB`, and `staticPasswords`. Each of these keys has nested configurations specific to their purpose.

## Symbols
### `issuer`
#### Description
Specifies the base URL where Dex will be accessible.

#### Internal Logic
- `http://localhost:5556/dex`: Sets the issuer URL to `http://localhost:5556/dex`. This is where Dex will be running and handling authentication requests.

### `storage`
#### Description
Configures the storage backend for Dex to persist data.

#### Internal Logic
- `type: sqlite3`: Uses SQLite3 as the storage mechanism.
- `config`:
    - `file: /var/dex/dex.db`: Sets the path to the SQLite3 database file.

### `web`
#### Description
Configures the web server settings for Dex.

#### Internal Logic
- `http: 0.0.0.0:5556`: Listens for HTTP traffic on all interfaces (0.0.0.0) on port 5556.

### `staticClients`
#### Description
Defines static client applications authorized to interact with Dex.

#### Internal Logic
- `-`: Defines a list of static clients.
  - `id: example-app`: Sets the client ID to "example-app".
  - `redirectURIs`:
    - `- http://localhost:8080/flipt/auth/v1/method/oidc/dex/callback`: Specifies the allowed redirect URI for the client after successful authentication.
  - `name: Example App`: Sets the display name of the client.
  - `secret: ZXhhbXBsZS1hcHAtc2VjcmV0`: Sets the client secret used for secure communication with Dex.

### `connectors`
#### Description
Configures connectors that allow Dex to authenticate users against different identity providers.

#### Internal Logic
- `-`: Defines a list of connectors.
  - `type: mockCallback`: Uses the "mockCallback" connector type, which is typically used for testing and development.
  - `id: mock`: Sets the connector ID to "mock".
  - `name: Example`: Sets the display name of the connector.

### `enablePasswordDB`
#### Description
Enables or disables the built-in password database for authentication.

#### Internal Logic
- `true`: Enables the password database, allowing users to authenticate with usernames and passwords stored within Dex.

### `staticPasswords`
#### Description
Defines static user credentials for the password database.

#### Internal Logic
- `-`: Defines a list of static user credentials.
  - `email: "admin@example.com"`: Sets the user's email address.
  - `hash: "$2a$10$2b2cU8CPhOTaGrs1HRQuAueS7JTT5ZHsHSzYiFPm1leZck7Mc8T4W"`: Stores the bcrypt hash of the user's password.
  - `username: "admin"`: Sets the user's username.
  - `userID: "08a8684b-db88-4b73-90a9-3cd1661f5466"`: Assigns a unique user ID.
