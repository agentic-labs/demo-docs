title: "docker-compose.yml"
---

## High-level description
This `docker-compose.yml` file defines a multi-container Docker application for running Flipt, a feature flag management service, behind a Caddy web server acting as a reverse proxy with basic authentication. It sets up two services, "caddy" and "flipt", and configures their networking, volumes, and environment variables.

## Code Structure
The `docker-compose.yml` file defines two services: `caddy` and `flipt`. The `caddy` service depends on the `flipt` service. Both services share the same network `flipt_network`.

## Symbols
### `caddy`
#### Description
This service defines the configuration for the Caddy web server, which acts as a reverse proxy, routing traffic to the Flipt service and handling basic authentication.

#### Inputs
This service uses the following environment variables as input:
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| HTTP_USERNAME | string | Username for basic authentication. |
| HTTP_PASSWORD_HASH | string | Bcrypt hashed password for basic authentication. |

#### Internal Logic
- It uses the `caddy:latest` image.
- Exposes port 8080 to the host machine.
- Mounts the `./Caddyfile` file from the host to `/etc/caddy/Caddyfile` in the container.
- Sets environment variables for basic authentication username and password hash.

### `flipt`
#### Description
This service defines the configuration for the Flipt feature flag service.

#### Internal Logic
- It uses the `flipt/flipt:latest` image.
- Runs the `./flipt` command with the `--force-migrate` flag.
- Sets the log level to `debug` and disables telemetry.

## Dependencies
- **Caddy:** Used as a reverse proxy and for basic authentication.
- **Flipt:** The main feature flag management service.

## Configuration
The `docker-compose.yml` file defines several configuration options through environment variables:

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| HTTP_USERNAME | string |  | Username for basic authentication in Caddy. |
| HTTP_PASSWORD_HASH | string |  | Bcrypt hashed password for basic authentication in Caddy. |
| FLIPT_LOG_LEVEL | string |  | Log level for the Flipt service. Set to `debug` in this configuration. |
| FLIPT_META_TELEMETRY_ENABLED | boolean |  | Flag to enable or disable telemetry in the Flipt service. Set to `false` in this configuration. |
