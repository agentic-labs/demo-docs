## High-level description
This directory contains an example implementation of securing a Flipt instance using HTTP Basic Authentication behind a reverse proxy. The setup utilizes Docker and docker-compose to orchestrate two main components: Caddy as the reverse proxy handling authentication, and Flipt as the feature flag management service.

## What does it do?
This example demonstrates how to add an extra layer of security to a Flipt instance by implementing HTTP Basic Authentication. Here's a breakdown of the workflow:

1. The user attempts to access the Flipt UI or API through a web browser or API client.
2. The request first hits the Caddy reverse proxy, which is configured to require basic authentication.
3. If the user hasn't provided valid credentials, they are prompted to enter a username and password.
4. Once valid credentials are provided, Caddy forwards the authenticated request to the Flipt service.
5. Flipt processes the request and returns the response, which is then sent back to the user through Caddy.

This setup ensures that all access to Flipt, whether through the UI or API, is protected by an additional authentication layer, enhancing the overall security of the system.

## Key Files
1. `docker-compose.yml`: This file defines the Docker services for both Caddy and Flipt, configuring their networking, volumes, and environment variables.

2. `Caddyfile`: Although not directly visible in the provided summaries, this file is referenced in the docker-compose.yml and likely contains the Caddy server configuration, including the reverse proxy and authentication settings.

3. `README.md`: Provides instructions on how to run the example and test the authentication setup.

## Dependencies
1. Docker: Used to containerize and run both Caddy and Flipt services.
2. docker-compose: Orchestrates the multi-container application defined in docker-compose.yml.
3. Caddy (caddy:latest): Acts as the reverse proxy and handles basic authentication.
4. Flipt (flipt/flipt:latest): The main feature flag management service being secured.

## Configuration
The setup can be configured through environment variables in the docker-compose.yml file:

1. For Caddy service:
   - `HTTP_USERNAME`: Sets the username for basic authentication.
   - `HTTP_PASSWORD_HASH`: Sets the bcrypt hashed password for basic authentication.

2. For Flipt service:
   - `FLIPT_LOG_LEVEL`: Set to "debug" for verbose logging.
   - `FLIPT_META_TELEMETRY_ENABLED`: Set to "false" to disable telemetry.

To run the example:
1. Execute `docker-compose up` in the directory.
2. Access the Flipt UI at http://localhost:8080.
3. Use the default credentials (admin:password) when prompted, or configure custom credentials by modifying the environment variables.

The README also provides examples of how to test the authentication using curl commands, demonstrating both unauthorized and authorized API requests.

This example serves as a practical guide for developers looking to enhance the security of their Flipt deployments by implementing basic authentication through a reverse proxy.
