## High-level description
This directory contains an example implementation of static token authentication for a Flipt instance. Flipt is a feature flag management system, and this example demonstrates how to secure it using a bootstrap token. The directory includes configuration files and instructions for setting up and testing the authentication mechanism.

## What does it do?
This example sets up a Flipt server with static token authentication enabled. It demonstrates how to:

1. Configure Flipt to require authentication using a static bootstrap token.
2. Run a Flipt instance using Docker and Docker Compose.
3. Test API access with and without the required authentication token.

The workflow is as follows:
1. The user starts the Flipt server using Docker Compose.
2. They attempt to access the Flipt API without authentication, which results in a 401 Unauthorized response.
3. They then access the API using the correct authentication token, which allows successful access to the API.

This setup ensures that only clients with the correct token can interact with the Flipt API, providing a basic level of security for the feature flag management system.

## Key Files

1. `README.md`: Provides instructions on how to run the example and test the authentication mechanism.

2. `config.yml`: Contains the configuration for the Flipt instance, including:
   - Logging settings
   - Database connection details
   - Authentication configuration, such as:
     - Enabling token-based authentication
     - Setting the bootstrap token
     - Defining token expiration and cleanup settings

3. `docker-compose.yml`: Defines the Docker setup for running the Flipt server, including:
   - The Flipt Docker image to use
   - Port mapping (8080:8080)
   - Volume mounting for the configuration file
   - Environment variable settings
   - Network configuration

## Configuration
The `config.yml` file contains the following key configurations:

```yaml
log:
  level: DEBUG

db:
  url: file:/var/opt/flipt/flipt.db

authentication:
  required: true
  methods:
    token:
      enabled: true
      bootstrap:
        token: secret
        expiration: 24h
      cleanup:
        interval: 1h
        grace_period: 24h
```

- Logging is set to DEBUG level for verbose output.
- The database is a SQLite file stored at `/var/opt/flipt/flipt.db`.
- Authentication is required and token-based authentication is enabled.
- The bootstrap token is set to "secret" with a 24-hour expiration.
- Token cleanup occurs every hour, with a 24-hour grace period for expired tokens.

## Dependencies
The example relies on the following dependencies:

1. Docker: Used to run the Flipt server in a containerized environment.
2. docker-compose: Used to orchestrate the Docker container and simplify the setup process.
3. Flipt: The feature flag management system being secured (latest version used in this example).

## Additional Notes

1. This example does not support the Flipt UI, as it doesn't work with static token authentication. For UI access, users should refer to the Dex example that uses OIDC for authentication.

2. The bootstrap token ("secret") is hardcoded in both the `config.yml` and `docker-compose.yml` files. In a production environment, this should be replaced with a secure, randomly generated token and stored securely.

3. The example uses SQLite as the database backend. For production use, it's recommended to use a more robust database solution like PostgreSQL.

4. The Docker setup includes disabling telemetry reporting, which may not be necessary for all use cases.

5. The example demonstrates both successful and unsuccessful API access attempts, highlighting the effectiveness of the authentication mechanism.

By following this example, developers can understand how to implement and test static token authentication in a Flipt instance, providing a foundation for securing their feature flag management system.
