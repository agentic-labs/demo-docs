## High-level description
This code defines a Docker Compose configuration file for running a Flipt server instance within a Docker container. It specifies the Docker image to use, maps ports, mounts a configuration file, sets environment variables, and defines a custom network.

## Code Structure
The code defines a single service named "flipt" within a Docker Compose version 3 configuration. It specifies the image, command, ports, volumes, environment, and networks for this service.

## Symbols
### `version: "3"`
#### Description
Specifies the Docker Compose file format version as version 3.

### `services:`
#### Description
Defines the services that make up the application.

### `flipt:`
#### Description
Defines a service named "flipt" which represents the Flipt server.

#### Internal Logic
- `image: flipt/flipt:latest`: Uses the latest version of the `flipt/flipt` Docker image from a Docker registry.
- `command: ["./flipt", "--force-migrate"]`: Overrides the default command of the image to execute `./flipt --force-migrate` when the container starts. This likely starts the Flipt server and forces database migrations.
- `ports:`: Maps port 8080 of the container to port 8080 on the host machine.
- `volumes:`: Mounts the local `./config.yml` file to `/etc/flipt/config/default.yml` inside the container, providing a way to configure the Flipt server.
- `environment:`: Sets environment variables for the container:
    - `FLIPT_LOG_LEVEL=debug`: Sets the log level to debug.
    - `FLIPT_META_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=false`: Disables telemetry reporting.
- `networks:`: Connects the service to the `flipt_network` network.

### `networks:`
#### Description
Defines the networks for the services.

### `flipt_network:`
#### Description
Defines a custom network named `flipt_network` for communication between services.
