## High-level description
This directory contains a collection of examples demonstrating various integrations and configurations for Flipt, a feature flag management system. The examples cover a wide range of topics including analytics, authentication, database integrations, metrics, tracing, and more. These examples are designed to showcase Flipt's flexibility and provide developers with practical, ready-to-use configurations for different scenarios.

## What does it do?
The examples in this directory illustrate how to:

1. Set up Flipt with different analytics backends (e.g., ClickHouse)
2. Implement various authentication methods (e.g., reverse proxy, OIDC, static token)
3. Configure Flipt with different database backends (e.g., CockroachDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL)
4. Integrate Flipt with metrics and monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana)
5. Implement distributed tracing using OpenTelemetry with various backends (e.g., Jaeger, Zipkin)
6. Use Flipt in a Next.js application for both server-side and client-side feature flagging
7. Integrate Flipt with OpenFeature and OpenTelemetry in a Go application
8. Set up Flipt with Redis as a caching backend

These examples provide developers with practical demonstrations of how to use Flipt in various scenarios, from basic setups to more complex integrations with other tools and services.

## Entry points
Each subdirectory within the `examples` folder represents a specific use case or integration. The main entry points for most examples are:

1. `README.md` files in each subdirectory, providing specific instructions and explanations
2. `docker-compose.yml` files, defining the multi-container applications for each example
3. Main application files (e.g., `main.go` for Go applications, `index.tsx` for Next.js)

Developers can navigate to the desired example directory and follow the instructions in the README to run and explore each example.

## Key Files
While each example has its own set of important files, some common key files across the examples include:

1. `docker-compose.yml`: Orchestrates the multi-container applications
2. `Dockerfile`: Defines custom images when needed
3. Configuration files for Flipt and other services (e.g., `flipt.yml`, `prometheus.yml`)
4. Main application files demonstrating Flipt integration in different languages and frameworks

## Dependencies
The examples rely on various dependencies, including:

1. Docker and docker-compose: Used in all examples for containerization and orchestration
2. Flipt: The core feature flag management system
3. Database systems: MySQL, PostgreSQL, CockroachDB, etc.
4. Monitoring and tracing tools: Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger, Zipkin
5. Web frameworks and libraries: Next.js, React, OpenFeature
6. Programming languages: Go, TypeScript, Python

## Configuration
Configuration methods vary across examples but generally include:

1. Environment variables in `docker-compose.yml` files
2. Flipt-specific configuration files (e.g., `flipt.yml`)
3. Service-specific configuration files (e.g., `prometheus.yml`, `otel-collector-config.yaml`)
4. Application-level configurations in code files

These examples provide a comprehensive resource for developers to understand and implement Flipt in various scenarios, showcasing its flexibility and integration capabilities with different technologies and tools in the software development ecosystem.
