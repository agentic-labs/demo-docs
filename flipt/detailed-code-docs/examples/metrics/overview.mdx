## High-level description
This directory contains an example setup for running Flipt with Prometheus for metrics collection and Grafana for visualization. It demonstrates how to configure and integrate these tools to monitor and analyze Flipt's performance and usage.

## What does it do?
This example setup allows developers to:
1. Run Flipt, Prometheus, and Grafana together using Docker Compose.
2. Collect metrics from Flipt using Prometheus.
3. Visualize these metrics using Grafana dashboards.

The workflow is as follows:
1. Flipt runs and exposes metrics.
2. Prometheus scrapes these metrics at regular intervals.
3. Grafana connects to Prometheus as a data source and displays the metrics in customizable dashboards.

This setup enables developers to monitor various aspects of Flipt's performance, such as request rates, response times, and resource usage, providing valuable insights for optimization and troubleshooting.

## Key Files
1. `docker-compose.yml`: This file defines the multi-container Docker application, including services for Flipt, Prometheus, and Grafana. It specifies how these services should be configured and connected.

2. `prometheus.yml`: This configuration file for Prometheus defines the scraping jobs, including targets and intervals for collecting metrics from Flipt and Prometheus itself.

3. `README.md`: Provides instructions on how to run the example and access the different components (Flipt UI, Prometheus UI, and Grafana UI).

## Dependencies
1. Docker (version not specified)
2. docker-compose (version not specified)
3. Flipt (latest version from Docker Hub)
4. Prometheus (latest version from Docker Hub)
5. Grafana (latest version from Docker Hub)

These dependencies were likely chosen for their popularity, ease of use, and strong integration capabilities. Docker and docker-compose provide a consistent and reproducible environment, while Prometheus and Grafana are industry-standard tools for metrics collection and visualization.

## Configuration
The main configuration files are:

1. `docker-compose.yml`:
   - Defines three services: prometheus, flipt, and grafana
   - Sets up a shared network called `flipt_network`
   - Configures port mappings, volumes, and environment variables for each service

   Key configurations:
   ```yaml
   flipt:
     environment:
       - FLIPT_LOG_LEVEL=debug
       - FLIPT_CACHE_ENABLED=false
       - FLIPT_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=false
   ```

2. `prometheus.yml`:
   - Configures global scrape interval and job-specific settings
   - Defines two scrape jobs: 'prometheus' and 'flipt'

   Key configurations:
   ```yaml
   global:
     scrape_interval: 15s

   scrape_configs:
     - job_name: 'prometheus'
       scrape_interval: 5s
       static_configs:
         - targets: ['localhost:9090']

     - job_name: 'flipt'
       scrape_interval: 5s
       static_configs:
         - targets: ['flipt:8080']
   ```

To run the example:
1. Execute `docker-compose up` in the directory
2. Access Flipt UI at http://localhost:8080
3. Access Prometheus UI at http://localhost:9090/graph
4. Access Grafana UI at http://localhost:3000

Users can then create sample data in Flipt, query metrics in Prometheus, and create or import dashboards in Grafana to visualize the collected metrics.
