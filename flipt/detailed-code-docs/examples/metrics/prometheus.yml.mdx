title: "prometheus.yml"
---

## High-level description
This YAML file defines scrape configurations for Prometheus, specifying which targets to collect metrics from and how often. It includes global settings like scrape interval and job-specific configurations for scraping Prometheus itself and a service named 'flipt'.

## Code Structure
The file uses a hierarchical structure with `global` settings and `scrape_configs` defining individual scraping jobs. Each job like 'prometheus' and 'flipt' specifies its own `scrape_interval` and `static_configs` which lists the target addresses.

## Symbols
### `global`
#### Description
Defines global settings for Prometheus scraping.

#### Inputs
N/A

#### Outputs
N/A

#### Internal Logic
- `scrape_interval`: Specifies the default time interval between metric scrapes.
- `external_labels`: (Commented out) Allows attaching custom labels to metrics and alerts.

### `scrape_configs`
#### Description
A list of scrape configurations, each defining a job to scrape metrics from.

#### Inputs
N/A

#### Outputs
N/A

#### Internal Logic
- Each entry represents a scraping job with a unique `job_name`.
- `scrape_interval`: Overrides the global scrape interval for this specific job.
- `static_configs`: Defines a list of target endpoints to scrape using statically defined targets.

## Dependencies
- **Prometheus**: This configuration file is specific to Prometheus and is used to configure its scraping behavior.

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| global.scrape_interval | duration | 15s | Default time interval between metric scrapes. |
| scrape_configs[].job_name | string | N/A | Name of the scraping job. |
| scrape_configs[].scrape_interval | duration | global.scrape_interval | Scrape interval for the specific job. |
| scrape_configs[].static_configs[].targets | list | N/A | List of target addresses to scrape. |
