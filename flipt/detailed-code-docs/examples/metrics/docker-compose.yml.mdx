## High-level description
This `docker-compose.yml` file defines a multi-container Docker application for running Flipt with Prometheus and Grafana for metrics monitoring. It sets up a network for communication between the containers and configures each service with specific settings and dependencies.

## Code Structure
The code defines three services: `prometheus`, `flipt`, and `grafana`. `flipt` depends on `prometheus` to ensure that Prometheus is running before Flipt starts. All three services are on the same network `flipt_network` to allow communication between them.

### `prometheus`
#### Description
Configures the Prometheus service, which is responsible for collecting metrics.

#### Inputs
N/A

#### Outputs
N/A

#### Internal Logic
- Uses the `prom/prometheus:latest` image.
- Exposes port `9090` for accessing the Prometheus web UI.
- Mounts the `./prometheus.yml` file to configure Prometheus.
- Connects to the `flipt_network` network.

### `flipt`
#### Description
Configures the Flipt service, which is the main application.

#### Inputs
N/A

#### Outputs
N/A

#### Internal Logic
- Uses the `flipt/flipt:latest` image.
- Runs the `./flipt --force-migrate` command on startup.
- Depends on the `prometheus` service.
- Exposes port `8080` for accessing the Flipt API.
- Connects to the `flipt_network` network.
- Sets environment variables for logging, caching, and telemetry.

### `grafana`
#### Description
Configures the Grafana service, which is used for visualizing metrics.

#### Inputs
N/A

#### Outputs
N/A

#### Internal Logic
- Sets environment variables for provisioning, anonymous authentication, and admin role.
- Defines an entrypoint script that:
    - Creates the `/etc/grafana/provisioning/datasources` directory.
    - Creates a `ds.yaml` file in that directory to configure a Prometheus data source.
    - Runs the default Grafana entrypoint script (`/run.sh`).
- Uses the `grafana/grafana:latest` image.
- Exposes port `3000` for accessing the Grafana web UI.
- Connects to the `flipt_network` network.

### `networks`
