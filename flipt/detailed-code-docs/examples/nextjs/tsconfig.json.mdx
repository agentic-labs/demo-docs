title: "tsconfig.json"
---

## High-level description
This file, `tsconfig.json`, defines the TypeScript compiler options and file inclusion/exclusion rules for a Next.js project. It specifies how TypeScript should transpile the project's TypeScript code into JavaScript that can be executed in a browser environment.

## Symbols
There are no significant symbols in this file, as it primarily consists of configuration options.

## Dependencies
This configuration file implicitly depends on the TypeScript compiler, `tsc`, to interpret and apply its settings during the build process.

### Configuration
This `tsconfig.json` file defines various TypeScript compiler options:

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| `target` | `string` | N/A | Specifies the ECMAScript version to target. Here, it's set to "es5" for broad browser compatibility. |
| `lib` | `string[]` | N/A | Lists the DOM APIs available to the TypeScript code. This project includes "dom", "dom.iterable", and "esnext" for a modern web development experience. |
| `allowJs` | `boolean` | N/A | Allows JavaScript files to be compiled alongside TypeScript files. |
| `skipLibCheck` | `boolean` | N/A | Skips type checking of declaration files (*.d.ts). |
| `strict` | `boolean` | N/A | Enables strict type checking for improved code quality. |
| `forceConsistentCasingInFileNames` | `boolean` | N/A | Enforces consistent casing in file names to avoid module resolution issues. |
| `noEmit` | `boolean` | N/A | Prevents the compiler from emitting JavaScript output files. This is useful when using tools like Babel for transpilation. |
| `esModuleInterop` | `boolean` | N/A | Enables interoperability between CommonJS and ES Modules. |
| `module` | `string` | N/A | Specifies the module system to use. "esnext" enables the latest ECMAScript module syntax. |
| `moduleResolution` | `string` | N/A | Determines how module imports are resolved. "node" uses the Node.js module resolution strategy. |
| `resolveJsonModule` | `boolean` | N/A | Allows importing JSON files as modules. |
| `isolatedModules` | `boolean` | N/A | Ensures each file is treated as a separate module, preventing unexpected type dependencies. |
| `jsx` | `string` | N/A | Specifies how JSX syntax should be handled. "preserve" keeps the JSX syntax in the output for processing by another tool. |
| `incremental` | `boolean` | N/A | Enables incremental compilation, speeding up subsequent builds by only recompiling changed files. |
| `include` | `string[]` | N/A | Specifies the files and directories to include in the compilation process. |
| `exclude` | `string[]` | N/A | Specifies the files and directories to exclude from the compilation process. |
