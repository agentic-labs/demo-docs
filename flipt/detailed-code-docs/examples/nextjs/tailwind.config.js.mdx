title: "tailwind.config.js"
---

## High-level description
This code defines a Tailwind CSS configuration file for a Next.js project. It specifies the locations of template files for Tailwind to scan for used styles and sets up an empty theme and plugins array for further customization.

## Symbols
### `module.exports`
#### Description
This symbol defines and exports a configuration object for the Tailwind CSS framework. It specifies the content paths, theme extensions, and plugins to be used in the project.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `module.exports` | Object | An object containing Tailwind CSS configuration options. |

#### Internal Logic
The configuration object has three main properties:

* **`content`**: An array of file paths that Tailwind CSS will scan to generate its utility classes. It includes paths to common directories in a Next.js project like `app`, `pages`, `components`, and `src`.
* **`theme`**: An object for extending or overriding the default Tailwind CSS theme. Currently, it's left empty (`{}`), meaning the default theme will be used.
* **`plugins`**: An array to include Tailwind CSS plugins for additional functionalities. It's currently empty (`[]`), meaning no plugins are being used.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| tailwindcss | Provides the Tailwind CSS framework and its configuration API. |

## Configuration
This code defines the core configuration for Tailwind CSS in the project. The `content` array is particularly important as it dictates which files Tailwind will analyze to generate its utility classes.
