## High-level description
This directory contains the core pages and API routes for a Next.js application that demonstrates the usage of feature flagging with the Flipt platform. It includes custom App and Document components, an API route for handling greetings, and the main index page.

## What does it do?
This Next.js application showcases how to implement feature flagging in a web application using Flipt. The main functionality revolves around displaying a greeting message to users, where the language of the greeting (English or Spanish) is determined dynamically based on a feature flag evaluation. 

The application uses server-side rendering to evaluate the feature flag before the page is sent to the client. This allows for a seamless user experience where the appropriate language is displayed without any visible switching on the client-side.

## Entry points
The main entry points for this directory are:

1. `index.tsx`: This is the home page of the application. It fetches a greeting message from the server and displays it to the user.

2. `_app.tsx`: This is the custom App component that wraps all pages in the Next.js application. It applies global styles and provides a consistent layout across all pages.

3. `_document.tsx`: This custom Document component defines the overall HTML structure of the application, including setting the language attribute and including necessary scripts.

4. `api/hello.ts`: This is an API route that handles requests for greeting messages. It uses the Flipt SDK to evaluate a feature flag and determine the appropriate language for the greeting.

The data flow in this application starts from the server-side, where the feature flag is evaluated either in the `getServerSideProps` function of `index.tsx` or in the API route `api/hello.ts`. The result of this evaluation determines the language of the greeting, which is then passed to the client-side components for rendering.

## Dependencies
1. Next.js: The React framework used for building the application. It provides server-side rendering, routing, and API routes.

2. React: Used for building the user interface components.

3. @flipt-io/flipt: The Flipt SDK used for evaluating feature flags. It's used both on the server-side and in API routes.

4. uuid: Used for generating unique identifiers for feature flag evaluations.

The Flipt SDK was chosen to integrate feature flagging capabilities into the application, allowing for dynamic control over features like language selection without requiring code changes or redeployments.

## Configuration
The application uses environment variables for configuration:

- `FLIPT_ADDR`: The address of the Flipt server. It defaults to "http://flipt:8080" if not specified.

This environment variable is used when initializing the Flipt client in both the API route and the server-side props function.

Here's an example of how the Flipt client is initialized:

```typescript
const client = new FliptApiClient({
  url: process.env.FLIPT_ADDR || 'http://flipt:8080',
  token: process.env.FLIPT_TOKEN,
});
```

The application also uses a feature flag named "language" in the "default" namespace. This flag is evaluated to determine the language for the greeting message. The possible values for this flag are:

- "en" for English
- "es" for Spanish

If the feature flag evaluation fails or returns an unexpected value, the application defaults to English.

This setup allows for easy modification of the application's behavior without changing the code. By adjusting the feature flag in the Flipt server, developers can control which users see which language, enabling A/B testing or gradual rollout of new language support.
