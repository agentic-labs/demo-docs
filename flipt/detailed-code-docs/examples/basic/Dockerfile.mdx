title: "Dockerfile"

## High-level description
This Dockerfile defines a multi-stage build process for a Go application tagged "example". It first builds the Go application and then creates a minimal Docker image containing only the necessary dependencies to run the application.

## Symbols
### `Dockerfile`
#### Description
This Dockerfile defines a Docker image for building and running a Go application. It uses a multi-stage build process to create a small and efficient final image.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Stage 1: Build Stage**
    - Uses `golang:${GO_VERSION}-alpine` as the base image, which is a minimal Docker image based on Alpine Linux and containing the Go SDK. The Go version is specified by the `GO_VERSION` build argument, which defaults to `1.20`.
    - Updates the package list using `apk update`.
    - Installs the `git` package using `apk add --no-cache git`.
    - Sets the working directory to `/example` within the container.
    - Copies the entire content of the directory where the Dockerfile is located into the container's working directory.
    - Runs `go mod tidy` to ensure the `go.mod` file is up-to-date.
    - Defines the default command to run when the container starts, which is `go run -tags "example" main.go`. This command builds and runs the Go application with the "example" build tag.
