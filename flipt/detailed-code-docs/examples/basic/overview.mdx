## High-level description
This directory contains a basic example of integrating Flipt, a feature flag management system, into a Go application. It demonstrates how to set up a simple web server that uses Flipt to control feature flags and display different content based on the flag's state.

## What does it do?
The example sets up a small ecosystem consisting of three main components:

1. A Flipt server that manages feature flags.
2. An initialization service that imports predefined flag data.
3. A sample Go application that interacts with Flipt and serves a web page.

The Go application connects to the Flipt server, retrieves the status of a specified feature flag, and renders a web page that displays different content based on whether the flag is enabled or disabled. Users can interact with this system by:

1. Starting the services using Docker Compose.
2. Viewing the example web page, which shows the current state of the feature flag.
3. Using the Flipt UI to enable or disable the feature flag.
4. Refreshing the example web page to see the content change based on the flag's new state.

This setup allows developers to understand how feature flags can be implemented and managed in a real-world application scenario.

## Entry points
The main entry points for this example are:

1. `docker-compose.yml`: This file defines the multi-container Docker application, including the Flipt server, initialization service, and the example Go application.

2. `main.go`: This is the core of the example Go application. It sets up an HTTP server, connects to the Flipt gRPC client, and handles requests by checking the feature flag status and rendering the appropriate content.

3. `Dockerfile`: This file defines how the example Go application is built and run in a Docker container.

The data flow in this example is as follows:
1. The initialization service imports flag data from `flipt.yml` into the Flipt server.
2. The example Go application connects to the Flipt server using gRPC.
3. When a request is received, the Go application queries Flipt for the flag status.
4. Based on the flag status, the application renders the appropriate content using the HTML template in the `tmpl` file.

## Key Files
1. `flipt.yml`: This file contains the initial configuration for the feature flag used in the example. It defines a namespace and a single flag named "Example" with the key "example".

2. `tmpl`: This HTML template file defines the structure of the web page served by the example application. It uses conditional rendering to display different content based on the feature flag's state.

## Dependencies
The example relies on the following key dependencies:

1. Docker and Docker Compose: Used to containerize and run the entire example ecosystem.

2. Flipt: The feature flag management system. The example uses the `flipt/flipt:latest` Docker image.

3. Go: The programming language used for the example application. The Dockerfile uses `golang:${GO_VERSION}-alpine` as the base image, with a default Go version of 1.20.

4. Flipt Go gRPC client: Imported as `flipt "go.flipt.io/flipt-grpc"` in `main.go`, this client is used to interact with the Flipt server.

5. gRPC: Used for communication between the example application and the Flipt server.

6. Bulma CSS: A CSS framework used for styling the HTML template.

## Configuration
The example uses several configuration options:

1. In `docker-compose.yml`:
   - Environment variables for Flipt logging and telemetry.
   - Port mappings for the Flipt server (8080 and 9000) and the example application (8000).

2. In `main.go`:
   - Command-line flags for specifying the Flipt server address (`-server`, default "flipt:9000") and the flag key to query (`-flag`, default "example").

3. In `flipt.yml`:
   - Definition of the "Example" flag in the "default" namespace.

This example provides a comprehensive demonstration of how to integrate Flipt into a Go application, showcasing the setup, configuration, and usage of feature flags in a containerized environment.
