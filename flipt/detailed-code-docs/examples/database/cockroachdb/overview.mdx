## High-level description
This directory contains an example setup for running Flipt, a feature flag management system, with a CockroachDB database instead of the default SQLite. The setup uses Docker and Docker Compose to orchestrate the Flipt application and CockroachDB database services.

## What does it do?
This example demonstrates how to configure and run Flipt with CockroachDB as the backend database. It sets up two main components:

1. A CockroachDB instance: This is a distributed SQL database that will store Flipt's data.
2. The Flipt application: This is the feature flag management system, configured to use the CockroachDB instance.

The setup uses Docker Compose to define and run these services together, ensuring that Flipt waits for the CockroachDB instance to be ready before starting. This allows developers and users to easily spin up a Flipt instance with CockroachDB for testing, development, or production use.

## Key Files
1. `Dockerfile`: This file defines how to build the Flipt Docker image with additional dependencies required for the CockroachDB setup.

2. `docker-compose.yml`: This file orchestrates the Flipt and CockroachDB services, defining how they should be run and connected.

3. `README.md`: Provides instructions on how to run the example and explains the configuration.

## Dependencies
- Docker: Used to containerize and run the services.
- Docker Compose: Used to define and manage the multi-container Docker application.
- Flipt: The feature flag management system (base image: `flipt/flipt:latest`).
- CockroachDB: The distributed SQL database (image: `cockroachdb/cockroach:latest-v21.2`).
- wait-for-it: A utility script used to wait for services to become available.

## Configuration
The main configuration is done through environment variables and Docker Compose settings:

1. `FLIPT_DB_URL`: Set to `cockroach://root@crdb:26257/defaultdb?sslmode=disable` to connect Flipt to the CockroachDB instance.
2. `FLIPT_LOG_LEVEL`: Set to `debug` for verbose logging.
3. `FLIPT_META_TELEMETRY_ENABLED`: Set to `false` to disable telemetry.

The CockroachDB service is configured to run in single-node mode with insecure settings for development purposes. It exposes port 26257 for client connections and uses a Docker volume for persistent storage.

The Flipt service is built from the Dockerfile in the current directory, waits for the CockroachDB service to be healthy before starting, and exposes port 8080 for accessing the Flipt UI.

Both services are connected to a Docker network named `flipt_network` to allow communication between them.

To run the example, users simply need to execute `docker-compose up` in the directory, and then access the Flipt UI at `http://localhost:8080`.
