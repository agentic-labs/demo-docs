## High-level description
This directory contains examples of how to set up and run Flipt, a feature flag management system, with various database backends. It demonstrates the flexibility of Flipt's storage configuration by providing examples for CockroachDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, LibSQL, and LiteFS (a distributed file system for SQLite).

## What does it do?
These examples showcase how to configure and deploy Flipt with different database systems, allowing developers to choose the most suitable backend for their specific use case. Each subdirectory contains a complete setup using Docker and Docker Compose, demonstrating:

1. How to configure Flipt to use a specific database backend
2. How to set up the chosen database in a containerized environment
3. How to ensure proper startup order and connectivity between Flipt and the database
4. In some cases (like LibSQL and LiteFS), how to set up distributed or replicated database systems

These examples provide developers with ready-to-use configurations for testing, development, or as a starting point for production deployments of Flipt with various database backends.

## Entry points
The main entry point for each example is typically the `docker-compose.yml` file in the respective subdirectory. This file defines the services, their configurations, and how they interact. The general workflow for using these examples is:

1. Navigate to the desired database example directory
2. Review the README.md file for specific instructions
3. Run `docker-compose up` to start the services
4. Access the Flipt UI, usually available at `http://localhost:8080`

## Key Files
Each database example subdirectory typically contains:

1. `README.md`: Provides instructions and explanations specific to that database setup
2. `Dockerfile`: Defines any custom images needed for the setup
3. `docker-compose.yml`: Orchestrates the multi-container application
4. Database-specific configuration files (e.g., `litefs.yml` for the LiteFS example)

## Dependencies
The examples rely on several common dependencies:

1. Docker and Docker Compose: Used for containerization and orchestration
2. Flipt: The feature flag management system being demonstrated
3. Database-specific images (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, CockroachDB)
4. wait-for-it script: Often used to manage service startup order

Specific versions and additional dependencies are detailed in each example's configuration.

## Configuration
Each example uses environment variables and Docker Compose settings to configure Flipt and the chosen database. Key configuration points include:

1. `FLIPT_DB_URL`: Specifies the connection string for Flipt to connect to the database
2. Database-specific environment variables (e.g., `MYSQL_DATABASE`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`)
3. Networking settings to allow communication between Flipt and the database
4. Volume mappings for data persistence

The configurations demonstrate best practices for running Flipt with each database backend, including proper connection settings, logging configurations, and in some cases, advanced setups like primary-replica configurations.

These examples provide developers with a comprehensive resource for understanding and implementing Flipt with various database backends, showcasing its flexibility and adaptability to different storage requirements.
