## High-level description
This directory contains an example setup for running Flipt, a feature flag management system, with a MySQL database instead of the default SQLite. It demonstrates how to configure and deploy Flipt using Docker and docker-compose, with MySQL as the backend database.

## What does it do?
This setup allows developers to run Flipt locally with a MySQL database. It creates two main components:

1. A MySQL database container: This serves as the persistent storage for Flipt's data.
2. A Flipt application container: This runs the Flipt service, connected to the MySQL database.

The configuration ensures that Flipt waits for the MySQL database to be ready before starting, and it automatically applies any necessary database migrations. This setup is ideal for testing or development environments where you want to simulate a production-like setup using MySQL instead of SQLite.

## Key Files
1. `Dockerfile`: This file defines the custom Flipt image, which is based on the official Flipt image but includes additional tools like `git` and `bash`, as well as the `wait-for-it` script for managing service startup order.

2. `docker-compose.yml`: This file orchestrates the multi-container application, defining both the MySQL and Flipt services, their configurations, and how they interact.

3. `README.md`: Provides instructions on how to run the example and explains the key configuration, particularly the `FLIPT_DB_URL` environment variable that connects Flipt to MySQL.

## Dependencies
- Docker: Used to containerize and run both Flipt and MySQL.
- docker-compose: Used to define and manage the multi-container application.
- MySQL (latest): The database used for storing Flipt's data.
- Flipt (latest): The feature flag management system.
- wait-for-it: A utility script used to ensure MySQL is ready before starting Flipt.

## Configuration
The main configuration is done through environment variables in the `docker-compose.yml` file:

1. MySQL configuration:
   ```yaml
   environment:
     MYSQL_DATABASE: flipt
     MYSQL_USER: mysql
     MYSQL_PASSWORD: password
     MYSQL_ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD: "true"
   ```

2. Flipt configuration:
   ```yaml
   environment:
     FLIPT_DB_URL: mysql://mysql:password@mysql:3306/flipt
     FLIPT_LOG_LEVEL: debug
     FLIPT_META_TELEMETRY_ENABLED: "false"
   ```

The `FLIPT_DB_URL` is particularly important as it specifies the connection string for Flipt to connect to the MySQL database.

To run this example, users simply need to execute `docker-compose up` in the directory containing these files. This will start both the MySQL and Flipt services, making the Flipt UI available at `http://localhost:8080`.

This setup provides a convenient way for developers to test Flipt with a MySQL backend, closely mimicking a production environment while remaining easy to set up and tear down.
