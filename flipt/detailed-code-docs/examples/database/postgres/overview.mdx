## High-level description
This directory contains an example setup for running Flipt, a feature flag management system, with a PostgreSQL database instead of the default SQLite. The setup uses Docker and Docker Compose to create a multi-container application consisting of a Flipt service and a PostgreSQL database service.

## What does it do?
This example demonstrates how to configure and run Flipt with a PostgreSQL database in a containerized environment. It sets up two main components:

1. A PostgreSQL database container that stores Flipt's data.
2. A Flipt container that runs the Flipt application, connected to the PostgreSQL database.

The setup ensures that the Flipt service waits for the PostgreSQL database to be ready before starting, and it configures Flipt to use the PostgreSQL database instead of the default SQLite database.

## Key Files
1. `Dockerfile`: This file extends the official Flipt Docker image by adding PostgreSQL client tools and a script for waiting for network services. It installs `git` and `bash`, and clones the `wait-for-it` repository, which is used to ensure the database is ready before starting Flipt.

2. `docker-compose.yml`: This file defines the multi-container application, specifying how the Flipt and PostgreSQL services should be built and run. It sets up networking, environment variables, and dependencies between the services.

3. `README.md`: This file provides instructions on how to run the example and explains the key configuration, particularly the `FLIPT_DB_URL` environment variable that points Flipt to the PostgreSQL database.

## Dependencies
The example relies on the following main dependencies:

1. Docker: Used to containerize the application components.
2. Docker Compose: Used to define and run the multi-container Docker application.
3. Flipt (latest version): The feature flag management system being demonstrated.
4. PostgreSQL 12: The database used to store Flipt's data.
5. wait-for-it script: A utility used to wait for the PostgreSQL service to be available before starting Flipt.

## Configuration
The main configuration for this example is done through environment variables and Docker Compose settings:

1. PostgreSQL configuration:
   - Database name: `flipt`
   - Username: `postgres`
   - Password: `password`

2. Flipt configuration:
   - Database URL: `postgres://postgres:password@postgres:5432/flipt?sslmode=disable`
   - Log level: `debug`
   - Telemetry: Disabled

3. Networking:
   - A custom bridge network `flipt_network` is created for communication between containers.
   - The Flipt service is exposed on port 8080 of the host machine.

The `docker-compose.yml` file also ensures that the Flipt service waits for the PostgreSQL service to be ready before starting, using the `wait-for-it.sh` script.

This example provides a clear and reproducible way to run Flipt with PostgreSQL, making it easier for developers to test and understand how to integrate Flipt with a production-grade database in a containerized environment.
