title: "docker-compose.yml"
---

## High-level description
This `docker-compose.yml` file defines a multi-container Docker application for running Flipt locally with a PostgreSQL database. It sets up two services: `postgres` for the database and `flipt` for the Flipt application itself.

## Code Structure
The `flipt` service depends on the `postgres` service, ensuring the database is running before Flipt starts. Both services are connected to a shared network `flipt_network`.

## Symbols
### `version`
#### Description
Specifies the Docker Compose file format version. Here, it's version 3.

### `services`
#### Description
Defines the services that make up the application. In this case, it defines two services: `postgres` and `flipt`.

### `postgres`
#### Description
Configures the PostgreSQL database service.

#### Internal Logic
- `image`: Uses the official `postgres:12` image from Docker Hub.
- `networks`: Connects to the `flipt_network`.
- `environment`: Sets environment variables for the PostgreSQL container:
    - `POSTGRES_DB`: Sets the database name to `flipt`.
    - `POSTGRES_USER`: Sets the database user to `postgres`.
    - `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`: Sets the database password to `password`.

### `flipt`
#### Description
Configures the Flipt application service.

#### Internal Logic
- `build`: Builds the Flipt image from the current directory (`.`).
- `depends_on`: Ensures the `postgres` service is started before starting the `flipt` service.
- `ports`: Maps port `8080` of the container to port `8080` of the host machine.
- `networks`: Connects to the `flipt_network`.
- `environment`: Sets environment variables for the Flipt container:
    - `FLIPT_DB_URL`: Sets the database connection string to connect to the PostgreSQL database running in the `postgres` container.
    - `FLIPT_LOG_LEVEL`: Sets the log level to `debug`.
    - `FLIPT_META_TELEMETRY_ENABLED`: Disables telemetry.
- `command`: Overrides the default command of the Flipt image. It first waits for the `postgres` service to be available on port `5432` using the `wait-for-it.sh` script. Once available, it runs the `flipt` executable with the `--force-migrate` flag.

### `networks`
#### Description
Defines the networks for the application.

### `flipt_network`
#### Description
A user-defined bridge network that allows communication between the `postgres` and `flipt` containers.
