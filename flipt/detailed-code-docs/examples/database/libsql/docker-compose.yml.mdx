## High-level description
This `docker-compose.yml` file defines a multi-container Docker application for demonstrating LibSQL database functionality. It sets up a primary-replica database cluster using `sqld` images and connects two instances of the `flipt` feature flagging service to them, each pointing to a different database instance.

## Code Structure
The code defines four services: `sqld-primary`, `sqld-replica`, `flipt-one`, and `flipt-two`. The `sqld` services form a primary-replica database cluster, while the `flipt` services depend on the respective `sqld` instances and connect to them using the provided environment variables.

## Symbols
### `sqld-primary`
#### Description
This service defines the primary node of the LibSQL database cluster. It uses the `ghcr.io/libsql/sqld:main` image and exposes HTTP and gRPC ports for communication.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
- Exposes port 8000 for HTTP communication.
- Exposes port 5000 for gRPC communication.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets the `SQLD_NODE` environment variable to `primary` to configure the node as the primary.
- Sets the `SQLD_HTTP_LISTEN_ADDR` and `SQLD_GRPC_LISTEN_ADDR` environment variables to define the listening addresses for HTTP and gRPC communication.
- Mounts the `/tmp/data.db` directory on the host machine to `/var/lib/sqld/iku.db` inside the container to persist the database data.

### `sqld-replica`
#### Description
This service defines a replica node for the LibSQL database cluster. It uses the same image as the primary node and connects to it using the provided environment variable.

#### Inputs
- Depends on the `sqld-primary` service to be running.

#### Outputs
- Exposes port 8080 for HTTP communication (mapped from container's port 8000).

#### Internal Logic
- Sets the `SQLD_NODE` environment variable to `replica` to configure the node as a replica.
- Sets the `SQLD_PRIMARY_URL` environment variable to `http://sqld-primary:5000` to connect to the primary node's gRPC port.
- Mounts the `/tmp/replica.db` directory on the host machine to `/var/lib/sqld/iku.db` inside the container to persist the replica's data.

### `flipt-one`
#### Description
This service runs an instance of the `flipt` feature flagging service connected to the primary LibSQL database.

#### Inputs
- Depends on the `sqld-primary` service to be running.

#### Outputs
- Exposes port 8080 for HTTP communication.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets the `FLIPT_DB_URL` environment variable to `http://sqld-primary:8000` to connect to the primary database's HTTP port.
- Configured to restart on failure.

### `flipt-two`
#### Description
This service runs another instance of the `flipt` feature flagging service, connected to the replica LibSQL database.

#### Inputs
- Depends on the `sqld-replica` service to be running.

#### Outputs
- Exposes port 8081 for HTTP communication.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets the `FLIPT_DB_URL` environment variable to `http://sqld-replica:8080` to connect to the replica database's HTTP port.
- Configured to restart on failure.

## Dependencies
- `ghcr.io/libsql/sqld:main`: Docker image for the LibSQL database.
- `flipt/flipt:nightly`: Docker image for the Flipt feature flagging service.
