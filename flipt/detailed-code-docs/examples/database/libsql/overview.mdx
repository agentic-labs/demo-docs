## High-level description
This directory contains an example implementation of using LibSQL, a fork of SQLite created by Turso, with Flipt, a feature flagging service. The example demonstrates how to set up a primary-replica database cluster using LibSQL's `sqld` service and connect multiple instances of Flipt to it, showcasing data replication and synchronization.

## What does it do?
This example sets up a distributed database system using LibSQL, which is designed to extend SQLite's capabilities for use cases that require network-based access and replication. It creates a primary database node and a replica node, then connects two separate instances of the Flipt feature flagging service to these database nodes.

The workflow allows users to:
1. Start up the entire system using Docker Compose
2. Access two separate Flipt user interfaces
3. Create and modify feature flags in either UI
4. Observe that changes made in one UI are reflected in the other, demonstrating successful data replication between the primary and replica databases

This setup illustrates how LibSQL can be used to create a distributed, replicated database system that maintains SQLite compatibility while adding features like HTTP interfaces and replication.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this example is the `docker-compose.yml` file, which defines the entire infrastructure. It sets up four services:

1. `sqld-primary`: The primary LibSQL database node
2. `sqld-replica`: A replica LibSQL database node
3. `flipt-one`: A Flipt instance connected to the primary database
4. `flipt-two`: Another Flipt instance connected to the replica database

The `README.md` file provides instructions on how to run the example and explains the overall structure and purpose of the setup.

## Configuration
The configuration for this example is primarily done through the `docker-compose.yml` file and environment variables set within it. Key configuration points include:

1. Database URLs:
   - Primary: `http://sqld-primary:8000`
   - Replica: `http://sqld-replica:8080`

2. Flipt configuration:
   - `flipt-one` uses the primary database URL
   - `flipt-two` uses the replica database URL

3. Data persistence:
   - Primary data is stored in `/tmp/data.db` on the host
   - Replica data is stored in `/tmp/replica.db` on the host

4. Port mappings:
   - Flipt UI 1: `http://localhost:8080`
   - Flipt UI 2: `http://localhost:8081`
   - sqld-primary HTTP: 8000
   - sqld-primary gRPC: 5000
   - sqld-replica HTTP: 8080 (mapped from container's 8000)

Environment variables used in the configuration:
- `SQLD_NODE`: Set to 'primary' or 'replica' to define the node type
- `SQLD_HTTP_LISTEN_ADDR`: Defines the HTTP listening address for sqld
- `SQLD_GRPC_LISTEN_ADDR`: Defines the gRPC listening address for sqld
- `SQLD_PRIMARY_URL`: Used by the replica to connect to the primary node
- `FLIPT_DB_URL`: Used by Flipt instances to connect to their respective databases

This configuration allows for a flexible and scalable setup that demonstrates the capabilities of LibSQL in a distributed environment, while also showcasing its integration with a real-world application like Flipt.
