## High-level description
This Dockerfile builds a Docker image based on Nginx with a custom configuration for serving a LiteFS database. It exposes port 80 for HTTP traffic and starts Nginx in non-daemon mode.

## Symbols
### `FROM nginx:alpine`
#### Description
This line specifies the base image for the Docker image. It uses the official `nginx:alpine` image, which is a lightweight Nginx image based on Alpine Linux.

### `COPY ./nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf`
#### Description
This line copies the `nginx.conf` file from the local directory to the `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` path inside the Docker image. This custom configuration file likely sets up Nginx to serve the LiteFS database.

### `EXPOSE 80`
#### Description
This line declares that the container will listen on port 80 for HTTP traffic. This does not publish the port on the host machine; it merely documents the port used by the application inside the container.

### `CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]`
#### Description
This line defines the command to run when the container starts. It executes `nginx` with the argument `-g "daemon off;"`. This starts Nginx in the foreground (non-daemon mode), which is necessary for the container to keep running.
