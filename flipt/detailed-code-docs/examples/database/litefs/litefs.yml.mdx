title: "litefs.yml"
---

## High-level description
This YAML file defines the configuration for a LiteFS instance, which provides distributed SQLite database functionality. It specifies settings for logging, FUSE mount point, data directory, lease management, and the command to execute for the application using the database.

## Code Structure
This file uses YAML syntax to define key-value pairs for various configuration options. The top-level keys represent different aspects of the LiteFS configuration, such as `log`, `fuse`, `data`, `lease`, and `exec`. Each of these keys further defines specific settings related to its functionality.

## Symbols
### `log`
#### Description
Configures the logging level for LiteFS.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| debug | boolean | Enables debug-level logging when set to `true`. |

#### Outputs
N/A

### `fuse`
#### Description
Configures the FUSE mount point for accessing the SQLite database.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| dir | string | Specifies the directory where the FUSE filesystem should be mounted. |

#### Outputs
N/A

### `data`
#### Description
Specifies the directory where LiteFS stores the SQLite database files.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| dir | string | The path to the directory for storing database files. |

#### Outputs
N/A

### `lease`
#### Description
Configures the lease management system for coordinating access to the database in a distributed environment.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| type | string | Sets the type of lease management. In this case, it's set to "static". |
| advertise-url | string | The URL used by the primary node to announce its availability. |
| candidate | boolean | Indicates whether this instance should participate in leader election. Determined by the environment variable `$IS_PRIMARY`. |

#### Outputs
N/A

### `exec`
#### Description
Defines the command to execute for the application that uses the SQLite database.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| - cmd | string | The command to run, in this case, "flipt". |

#### Outputs
N/A

## Configuration
This file itself serves as the configuration file for LiteFS. The key-value pairs within the file define various configuration options.

## Dependencies
This configuration file implies a dependency on LiteFS and potentially other tools like FUSE. 

## TODOs
- The `$IS_PRIMARY` environment variable suggests an external mechanism for determining primary node status. This mechanism should be documented elsewhere.
