## High-level description
This directory contains examples demonstrating how to configure and implement audit event logging in Flipt, a feature flag management system. It showcases two main approaches: logging to a file with Grafana Loki integration, and sending audit events to a webhook.

## What does it do?
The examples in this directory illustrate how to set up comprehensive tracking and analysis of audit events in Flipt. They demonstrate two primary workflows:

1. Log File/Grafana Loki Integration:
   - Flipt generates audit logs for various operations (create, update, delete) on different entities (flags, variants, segments, etc.).
   - These logs are written to a file.
   - Promtail, a log collection agent, reads these log files and forwards them to Loki.
   - Loki stores and indexes the logs.
   - Grafana provides a user interface to query and visualize the audit logs.

2. Webhook Integration:
   - Flipt is configured to send audit events to a webhook.
   - A simple Python HTTP server receives and logs these events.
   - The webhook payload can be customized using templates.
   - Specific event types (e.g., flag creation and updates) can be configured for logging.

These setups allow administrators to monitor and analyze important actions taken within Flipt, enhancing security and providing valuable insights into system usage.

## Key Files

1. Log File/Grafana Loki Example:
   - `log/docker-compose.yml`: Defines the multi-container Docker application for Flipt, Loki, Promtail, and Grafana.
   - `log/promtail.yml`: Configures Promtail for log collection and forwarding to Loki.

2. Webhook Example:
   - `webhook/docker-compose.yml` and `webhook/docker-compose.template.yml`: Define Docker environments for running Flipt and the webhook receiver.
   - `webhook/server.py`: Implements the Python webhook receiver.
   - `webhook/flipt.config.yml`: Configures Flipt's audit logging and webhook settings.

3. `README.md`: Provides an overview of the audit examples and links to specific implementations.

## Dependencies
The examples rely on several key dependencies:

1. Flipt (flipt/flipt:latest): The main application that generates audit logs.
2. Loki (grafana/loki:2.7.3): A log aggregation system (used in the log file example).
3. Promtail (grafana/promtail:2.7.4): A log shipping agent (used in the log file example).
4. Grafana (grafana/grafana:latest): A visualization tool for querying and displaying logs (used in the log file example).
5. Python: Used to implement the webhook receiver in the webhook example.

These dependencies create robust and scalable logging systems that integrate well with Flipt and provide powerful querying and visualization capabilities.

## Configuration
Both examples use configuration files and environment variables to set up Flipt and the logging systems:

1. Log File/Grafana Loki Example:
   - Environment variables in `log/docker-compose.yml` configure Flipt for debug logging, audit logging to a file, and disable telemetry.
   - `log/promtail.yml` configures Promtail to scrape logs from Flipt and forward them to Loki.

2. Webhook Example:
   - Environment variables in `webhook/docker-compose.yml` enable audit logging and specify which events to log.
   - `webhook/flipt.config.yml` configures Flipt's audit logging and webhook settings, including event filtering and payload templating.

These configurations allow for easy setup of complete audit logging systems for Flipt, with minimal manual intervention required.
