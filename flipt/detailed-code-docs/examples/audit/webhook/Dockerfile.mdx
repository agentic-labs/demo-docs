## High-level description
This Dockerfile builds a Docker image for a simple Python web server that likely serves as a webhook endpoint for audit events. The server is defined in the `server.py` file.

## Symbols
### `FROM python:3.11`
#### Description
This line specifies that the image should be built from the official Python 3.11 Docker image. This provides a base image with Python 3.11 pre-installed.

### `ADD server.py .`
#### Description
This line copies the `server.py` file from the current directory on the host machine into the root directory of the Docker image.

### `CMD ["python", "server.py"]`
#### Description
This line defines the default command to run when a container is started from the image. It will execute the `server.py` script using the Python interpreter.
