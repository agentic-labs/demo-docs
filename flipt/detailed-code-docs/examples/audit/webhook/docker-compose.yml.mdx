## High-level description
This `docker-compose.yml` file defines a multi-container Docker application for demonstrating Flipt's audit webhook feature. It sets up two services: `flipt` running the Flipt application and `webhook` which is a custom service listening for audit events.

## Code Structure
The `flipt` service is configured with environment variables to enable the audit webhook, specify the webhook URL, and define which events to send. The `webhook` service is built from the current directory and both services share a common network.

## Symbols
### `flipt`
#### Description
This service runs the main Flipt application. It's configured to enable audit webhooks and send specific events to the `webhook` service.

#### Inputs
Environment variables:
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `FLIPT_LOG_LEVEL` | string | Sets the log level for Flipt (set to `debug`). |
| `FLIPT_AUDIT_SINKS_WEBHOOK_ENABLED` | boolean | Enables the audit webhook sink (set to `true`). |
| `FLIPT_AUDIT_EVENTS` | string | Specifies the events to send to the webhook (`flag:created` and `flag:updated`). |
| `FLIPT_AUDIT_SINKS_WEBHOOK_URL` | string | Sets the URL of the webhook service (`http://webhook:8081/`). |
| `FLIPT_META_TELEMETRY_ENABLED` | boolean | Disables telemetry data collection (set to `false`). |

#### Outputs
Exposes port 8080 for accessing the Flipt application.
Sends audit events to the configured webhook URL.

### `webhook`
#### Description
This service represents a custom application that listens for and processes audit events from Flipt.

#### Inputs
Receives HTTP POST requests containing audit event data from the `flipt` service.

#### Outputs
The output of this service depends on its implementation. It's expected to handle incoming audit events.
