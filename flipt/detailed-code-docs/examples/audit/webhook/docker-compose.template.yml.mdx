## High-level description
This Docker Compose file defines a multi-container application for demonstrating Flipt's webhook integration for audit logs. It sets up two services: `flipt` running the Flipt server and `webhook` which likely represents a service consuming Flipt's webhook events.

## Code Structure
The `flipt` service uses the official `flipt/flipt:latest` image, exposes port 8080, and mounts a configuration file. The `webhook` service is built from the current directory and shares the `flipt_network` with the `flipt` service.

## Symbols
### `flipt`
#### Description
This service runs the Flipt server. It uses the official Flipt Docker image and is configured to force database migrations on startup.

#### Inputs

- **Command**: `["./flipt", "--force-migrate", "--config", "/etc/flipt/flipt.config.yml"]` - Starts the Flipt server, forcing database migrations and using the specified configuration file.
- **Volumes**: `./flipt.config.yml:/etc/flipt/flipt.config.yml` - Mounts the local `flipt.config.yml` file into the container.

#### Outputs
- **Port**: `8080:8080` - Exposes the Flipt server on port 8080.

### `webhook`
#### Description
This service represents the webhook consumer. It is built from the Dockerfile in the current directory.
