title: "promtail.yml"

## High-level description
This YAML file defines a Promtail configuration for scraping and shipping Flipt audit logs to a Loki instance. It specifies the server settings, positions file location, Loki client configuration, and scrape configuration for audit logs.

## Code Structure
The code is structured as a YAML configuration file with nested sections for server settings, positions, clients, and scrape configurations. The `scrape_configs` section defines a job named `flipt-audit-logs` that targets log files on the local machine and uses a pipeline to extract JSON fields and add labels to the log entries.

## Symbols
### `server`
#### Description
This section defines the Promtail server settings.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a configuration section, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a configuration section, not a function.

#### Internal Logic
- `http_listen_port`: Specifies the port for the Promtail HTTP server (9080).
- `grpc_listen_port`: Specifies the port for the Promtail gRPC server (disabled by setting to 0).
- `log_level`: Sets the logging level for Promtail (info).

### `positions`
#### Description
This section defines the location of the file where Promtail stores its file positions.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a configuration section, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a configuration section, not a function.

#### Internal Logic
- `filename`: Specifies the path to the positions file (/tmp/positions.yaml).

### `clients`
#### Description
This section defines the Loki client configuration for sending logs.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a configuration section, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a configuration section, not a function.

#### Internal Logic
- `url`: Specifies the URL of the Loki server (http://loki:3100/loki/api/v1/push).
- `tenant_id`: Sets the tenant ID for the Loki client (docker).

### `scrape_configs`
#### Description
This section defines the scrape configurations for collecting logs.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a configuration section, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a configuration section, not a function.

#### Internal Logic
- `job_name`: Specifies the name of the scrape job (flipt-audit-logs).
- `static_configs`: Defines a static list of targets to scrape.
    - `targets`: List of target addresses (localhost).
    - `labels`: Labels to add to the scraped logs.
        - `job`: Job name (flipt-audit-logs).
        - `__path__`: Path to the log files (/var/log/flipt/*.log).
- `pipeline_stages`: Defines the pipeline stages for processing log entries.
    - `json`: Parses log entries as JSON.
        - `expressions`: JSON expressions to extract fields.
            - `type`: Extracts the value of the "type" field.
            - `action`: Extracts the value of the "action" field.
    - `labels`: Adds labels to log entries based on extracted fields.
        - `type`: Adds a label named "type" with the extracted "type" value.
        - `action`: Adds a label named "action" with the extracted "action" value.

## Dependencies
- **Promtail:** This configuration file is intended for use with Promtail, a log agent that ships logs to Loki.
- **Loki:** The configuration assumes a running Loki instance is available at the specified URL.

## Logging
This configuration file defines the logging level for Promtail itself (`log_level`), but it doesn't specify any logging configuration for the application being monitored (Flipt).
