## High-level description
This `docker-compose.yml` file defines a multi-container Docker application for demonstrating Flipt's audit logging capabilities with Loki. It sets up Flipt, Loki, Promtail, and Grafana containers to collect, store, and visualize audit logs.

## Code Structure
The code defines several services that interact with each other:
- `flipt`: The main Flipt application, configured to enable audit logging to a file.
- `init`: An initialization container that sets up correct permissions for the Loki data volume.
- `promtail`: Collects Flipt's audit logs and sends them to Loki.
- `loki`: Stores the audit logs received from Promtail.
- `grafana`: Provides a visual dashboard for exploring the audit logs stored in Loki.

## Symbols
### `services`
#### Description
This section defines the different containers that make up the application.

#### Internal Logic
Each service is defined with its image, commands, volumes, ports, environment variables, and network connections.

### `flipt`
#### Description
This service runs the Flipt application.

#### Internal Logic
- It uses the `flipt/flipt:latest` image.
- Runs the `./flipt --force-migrate` command on startup.
- Mounts the `./loki/` directory to `/var/log/` for sharing logs with Loki.
- Exposes port 8080.
- Sets environment variables to enable debug logging, audit log sinking to a file (`/var/log/flipt/audit.log`), and disable telemetry.
- Connects to the `flipt_network`.

### `init`
#### Description
This service is an initialization container that runs before other services to ensure correct file permissions for Loki.

#### Internal Logic
- Uses the `grafana/loki:2.7.3` image.
- Runs as the `root` user.
- Executes `chown 10001:10001 /loki` to change ownership of the `/loki` directory to the user used by Loki.
- Mounts the `./loki` directory to `/loki`.
- Connects to the `flipt_network`.

### `promtail`
#### Description
This service collects logs from Flipt and sends them to Loki.

#### Internal Logic
- Uses the `grafana/promtail:2.7.4` image.
- Mounts the `./loki/` directory to `/var/log/` for reading logs.
- Mounts the `./promtail.yml` file to `/etc/promtail/promtail.yml` for configuration.
- Exposes port 9080.
- Runs Promtail with the configuration file specified.
- Connects to the `flipt_network`.

### `loki`
#### Description
This service runs Loki, which stores the logs received from Promtail.

#### Internal Logic
- Uses the `grafana/loki:2.7.3` image.
- Mounts the `./loki/` directory to `/loki` for data persistence.
- Exposes port 3100.
- Runs Loki with the configuration file at `/etc/loki/local-config.yaml`.
- Depends on the `init` and `promtail` services to start after them.
- Connects to the `flipt_network`.

### `grafana`
#### Description
This service runs Grafana, which provides a visual dashboard for exploring the logs stored in Loki.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets environment variables for Grafana configuration, including enabling anonymous authentication and setting the default data source to Loki.
- Uses a custom entrypoint script to:
    - Create the provisioning directory for Grafana.
    - Define a Loki data source in `/etc/grafana/provisioning/datasources/ds.yaml`.
    - Run the default Grafana startup script.
- Uses the `grafana/grafana:latest` image.
- Exposes port 3000.
- Connects to the `flipt_network`.

### `networks`
#### Description
This section defines the network used by the services to communicate with each other.

#### Internal Logic
- Defines a single network named `flipt_network`.
