## High-level description
This directory contains an example setup for implementing audit event logging in Flipt using Grafana Loki. It demonstrates how to configure Flipt to output audit logs, collect these logs using Promtail, store them in Loki, and visualize them using Grafana.

## What does it do?
This setup enables comprehensive tracking and analysis of audit events in Flipt. It works as follows:

1. Flipt is configured to generate audit logs for various operations (create, update, delete) on different entities (flags, variants, segments, etc.).
2. These audit logs are written to a file.
3. Promtail, a log collection agent, reads these log files and forwards them to Loki.
4. Loki, a log aggregation system, stores and indexes these logs.
5. Grafana provides a user interface to query and visualize the audit logs stored in Loki.

This setup allows administrators to monitor and analyze all important actions taken within Flipt, enhancing security and providing valuable insights into system usage.

## Key Files

1. `docker-compose.yml`: This file defines the multi-container Docker application, including services for Flipt, Loki, Promtail, and Grafana. It specifies how these services should be configured and how they interact with each other.

2. `promtail.yml`: This configuration file for Promtail defines how it should collect logs from Flipt and forward them to Loki. It includes settings for the Promtail server, file positions tracking, Loki client configuration, and log scraping rules.

3. `README.md`: This file provides an overview of the example, including setup instructions and a brief explanation of how to use the Grafana interface to query audit logs.

## Dependencies
The example relies on several key dependencies:

1. Flipt (flipt/flipt:latest): The main application that generates audit logs.
2. Loki (grafana/loki:2.7.3): A log aggregation system that stores and indexes the audit logs.
3. Promtail (grafana/promtail:2.7.4): A log shipping agent that collects logs from Flipt and sends them to Loki.
4. Grafana (grafana/grafana:latest): A visualization tool that provides a user interface for querying and displaying the logs stored in Loki.

These dependencies were chosen to create a robust and scalable logging system that integrates well with Flipt and provides powerful querying and visualization capabilities.

## Configuration
The example uses several configuration files and environment variables:

1. In `docker-compose.yml`, Flipt is configured with the following environment variables:
   ```yaml
   FLIPT_LOG_LEVEL: DEBUG
   FLIPT_AUDIT_SINKS_LOG_ENABLED: "true"
   FLIPT_AUDIT_SINKS_LOG_FILE: /var/log/flipt/audit.log
   FLIPT_META_TELEMETRY_ENABLED: "false"
   ```
   These enable debug logging, audit logging to a file, and disable telemetry.

2. The `promtail.yml` file configures Promtail to scrape logs from `/var/log/flipt/*.log`, parse them as JSON, and extract `type` and `action` fields as labels.

3. Grafana is configured with environment variables in `docker-compose.yml` to enable anonymous access and set Loki as the default data source.

This configuration allows for easy setup of a complete audit logging system for Flipt, with minimal manual intervention required.
