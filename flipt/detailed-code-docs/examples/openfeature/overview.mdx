## High-level description
This directory contains an example implementation of a Go application that demonstrates the integration of Flipt (a feature flag management system) with OpenFeature and OpenTelemetry. The example showcases how to use feature flags in a REST API while also implementing distributed tracing.

## What does it do?
The example sets up a simple REST API with a single endpoint ("/api/greeting") that returns a greeting message in different languages based on a feature flag. The application uses Flipt to manage feature flags, OpenFeature as a standardized API for feature flag evaluation, and OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing. The entire setup is containerized using Docker, allowing for easy deployment and testing.

The workflow is as follows:
1. The application initializes, setting up tracing with Jaeger and configuring the Flipt OpenFeature provider.
2. When a request is made to the "/api/greeting" endpoint, the application evaluates a feature flag to determine the language for the greeting.
3. The response is returned to the user, and the entire process is traced using OpenTelemetry, with the trace data being sent to Jaeger for visualization and analysis.

## Entry points
The main entry point for the application is the `main.go` file, which sets up the server, initializes the OpenFeature client with the Flipt provider, and defines the API endpoint.

The `docker-compose.yml` file is the entry point for running the entire system, including the Flipt server, Jaeger for tracing, and the example application itself.

## Key Files
1. `main.go`: Contains the main application logic, including the API endpoint, OpenFeature setup, and tracing configuration.
2. `flipt.yml`: Defines the feature flags and segments used by Flipt for this example.
3. `Dockerfile`: Specifies how to build the Docker image for the example application.
4. `docker-compose.yml`: Orchestrates the entire system, including Flipt, Jaeger, and the example application.

## Dependencies
The example relies on several external libraries and services:

1. Flipt (latest version): Used for feature flag management.
2. OpenFeature Go SDK: Provides a standardized API for feature flag evaluation.
3. Flipt OpenFeature Provider: Allows OpenFeature to interact with Flipt.
4. OpenTelemetry: Used for distributed tracing and instrumentation.
5. Jaeger (version 1): Distributed tracing system for visualizing traces.
6. Gorilla Mux: HTTP router and dispatcher for the API.

## Configuration
The application can be configured using command-line flags:

- `server`: Address of the Flipt backend server (default: "flipt:9000")
- `jaeger`: Address of the Jaeger server (default: "jaeger:4317")

The `flipt.yml` file contains the configuration for feature flags and segments used in the example:

```yaml
namespace: default
flags:
  - key: language
    name: Language
    description: The language of the user
    enabled: true
    variants:
      - key: es
        name: Spanish
      - key: en
        name: English
      - key: fr
        name: French
    rules:
      - segment: all
        distributions:
          - variant: es
            rollout: 33.33
          - variant: en
            rollout: 33.33
          - variant: fr
            rollout: 33.34
segments:
  - key: all
    name: all
    match_type: ALL_MATCH_TYPE
```

This configuration sets up a "language" feature flag with three variants (Spanish, English, and French) and a rule that distributes these variants equally across all users.

To run the example, use the following command from the `examples/openfeature` directory:

```
docker-compose up
```

This will start all the necessary services, including Flipt, Jaeger, and the example application. You can then access the API at `http://localhost:8000/api/greeting`, the Flipt UI at `http://localhost:8080`, and the Jaeger UI at `http://localhost:16686`.

The example demonstrates how to integrate feature flagging with distributed tracing in a microservices architecture, providing insights into both feature flag evaluations and the overall system performance and behavior.
