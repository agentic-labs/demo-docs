title: "Dockerfile"
---

## High-level description
This Dockerfile defines a build environment and runtime image for an example Go application that utilizes the OpenFeature framework. It sets up a container based on a specific Go Alpine Linux image, installs necessary dependencies, copies the application code, and defines the entry point for running the application.

## Symbols
### `Dockerfile`
#### Description
This Dockerfile defines a multi-stage Docker build process for building and running a Go application that demonstrates the usage of the OpenFeature framework.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Stage 1: Build Stage (implicit)**
   - Uses `golang:${GO_VERSION}-alpine` as the base image, leveraging a specific Go version (defaulting to 1.20) and a lightweight Alpine Linux distribution.
   - Updates the package list using `apk update`.
   - Installs the `git` package, which is required for fetching Go modules, using `apk add --no-cache git`.
   - Sets `/example` as the working directory.
   - Copies the entire content of the context (presumably the application code) into the container's `/example` directory.
   - Fetches and updates dependencies defined in the `go.mod` file using `go mod tidy`.
2. **Stage 2: Run Stage (implicit)**
   - Uses the output of the previous stage as the base image.
   - Defines the entry point for the container using `ENTRYPOINT ["go", "run", "-tags", "example", "main.go"]`, which executes the `main.go` file with the "example" build tag.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| golang:${GO_VERSION}-alpine | Provides the Go runtime environment and a minimal Alpine Linux base image. |
| git | Required for fetching Go modules during the build process. |
