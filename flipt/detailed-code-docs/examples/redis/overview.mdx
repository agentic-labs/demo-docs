## High-level description
This directory contains an example configuration for running Flipt with Redis as a cache backend. It demonstrates how to set up a Docker-based environment where Flipt uses Redis for caching flags and evaluation responses. The example includes a Dockerfile for building a custom Flipt image, a docker-compose file for orchestrating the services, and a README explaining the setup and usage.

## What does it do?
This example showcases how to integrate Flipt with Redis for caching purposes. It sets up two main components:

1. A Redis server: This acts as the cache backend for Flipt.
2. A Flipt instance: This is configured to use the Redis server for caching.

The setup allows Flipt to store and retrieve feature flags and evaluation responses in Redis, potentially improving performance by reducing the need to query the primary database for frequently accessed data.

## Key Files
1. `Dockerfile`: This file extends the official Flipt image by adding additional tools like git and bash, and includes a wait-for-it script. These additions are likely for development and testing purposes.

2. `docker-compose.yml`: This file defines the multi-container application, specifying how the Redis and Flipt services should be run and connected.

3. `README.md`: This file provides an overview of the example, explains the Redis configuration, and gives instructions on how to run the example.

## Dependencies
The main dependencies for this example are:

1. Docker: Used to containerize and run the services.
2. docker-compose: Used to define and manage the multi-container application.
3. Redis: Latest version, used as the caching backend.
4. Flipt: Latest version, used as the base image for the custom Flipt container.
5. wait-for-it script: Cloned from GitHub (https://github.com/vishnubob/wait-for-it), used to ensure Redis is available before starting Flipt.

## Configuration
The configuration for this example is primarily done through environment variables set in the `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
environment:
  - FLIPT_CACHE_ENABLED=true
  - FLIPT_CACHE_TTL=60s
  - FLIPT_CACHE_BACKEND=redis
  - FLIPT_CACHE_REDIS_HOST=redis
  - FLIPT_CACHE_REDIS_PORT=6379
  - FLIPT_LOG_LEVEL=debug
  - FLIPT_META_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=false
```

These environment variables configure Flipt to:
- Enable caching
- Set the cache TTL to 60 seconds
- Use Redis as the cache backend
- Connect to the Redis service named "redis" on port 6379
- Set the log level to debug
- Disable telemetry

The `docker-compose.yml` file also defines a custom network (`flipt_network`) to allow communication between the Flipt and Redis services.

To run the example, users need to execute `docker-compose up` in the directory containing these files. This will start both the Redis and Flipt services, with Flipt configured to use Redis for caching.
