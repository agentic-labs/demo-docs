title: "tracing_test.go"

## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for the tracing package in Flipt. It tests the creation of OpenTelemetry resources and the configuration of various tracing exporters (Jaeger, Zipkin, and OTLP) based on different configuration settings.

## Code Structure
The file contains two main test functions:
1. `TestNewResourceDefault`: Tests the creation of OpenTelemetry resources with different environment variables.
2. `TestGetExporter`: Tests the configuration of different tracing exporters based on various configuration settings.

## Symbols

### `TestNewResourceDefault`
#### Description
This function tests the `newResource` function with different environment variable configurations.

#### Internal Logic
1. Defines test cases with different environment variable settings.
2. For each test case:
   - Sets the environment variables.
   - Calls `newResource` function.
   - Asserts that no error occurred.
   - Compares the resulting attributes with the expected attributes.

### `TestGetExporter`
#### Description
This function tests the `GetExporter` function with different tracing configurations.

#### Internal Logic
1. Defines test cases for different tracing exporters (Jaeger, Zipkin, OTLP HTTP, OTLP HTTPS, OTLP GRPC, and an unsupported exporter).
2. For each test case:
   - Resets the `traceExpOnce` sync.Once.
   - Calls `GetExporter` with the test configuration.
   - If an error is expected, asserts that the error matches the expected error.
   - Otherwise, asserts that no error occurred and that the exporter and cleanup function are not nil.
   - Calls the cleanup function and asserts no error occurred.

## Dependencies
- `github.com/stretchr/testify/assert`: Used for test assertions.
- `go.flipt.io/flipt/internal/config`: Provides configuration structures.
- `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/attribute`: Used for OpenTelemetry attributes.
- `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/semconv/v1.26.0`: Provides semantic conventions for OpenTelemetry.

## Error Handling
The tests use `assert.NoError` and `assert.EqualError` to check for expected errors or absence of errors in various scenarios.

## Performance Considerations
The tests use `sync.Once` to ensure that the exporter is only created once, which is important for performance in the actual implementation.
