## High-level description
This code contains a unit test for a trailing slash middleware in a Go HTTP server. The test verifies that the middleware correctly removes trailing slashes from URLs when enabled, and leaves them intact when disabled.

## Symbols

### `TestTrailingSlashMiddleware`
#### Description
This function is a unit test that checks the behavior of a custom middleware for handling trailing slashes in URLs.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| t | *testing.T | The testing object provided by Go's testing framework |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up a new Chi router with a custom middleware.
2. Defines a simple GET route "/hello".
3. Creates a test HTTP server.
4. Performs two HTTP requests:
   a. With the middleware enabled (trailing slash should be removed).
   b. With the middleware disabled (trailing slash should remain).
5. Asserts the expected status codes for both requests.

#### Performance Considerations
This test uses an in-memory HTTP server, which is efficient for testing purposes but may not reflect real-world performance characteristics.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| net/http | For HTTP server and client functionality |
| net/http/httptest | For creating a test HTTP server |
| github.com/go-chi/chi/v5 | For routing functionality |
| github.com/stretchr/testify/assert | For test assertions |

## Constants
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| tsoHeader | string | Header name used to enable/disable the trailing slash middleware |

## References
The test references an undefined function `removeTrailingSlash`, which is likely defined in another file within the package.

## Error Handling
The test uses `assert.NoError` to check for any errors during request creation and execution. If an error occurs, the test will fail.

## Notes
1. The middleware is conditionally applied based on the presence of a custom header (`trailing-slash-on`).
2. The test doesn't explicitly check the modified URL path, only the resulting status code.
3. The `removeTrailingSlash` function is used but not defined in this file, indicating it's imported from elsewhere in the package.
