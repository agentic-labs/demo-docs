Here's a high-level description and documentation of the `internal/cmd/grpc.go` file:

## High-level description

This file defines the `GRPCServer` struct and its associated methods for configuring and running Flipt's gRPC server. It sets up various components such as storage, caching, authentication, authorization, metrics, tracing, and audit logging. The server is designed to be highly configurable and extensible, supporting different storage backends, authentication methods, and observability features.

## Code Structure

The main symbol in this file is the `GRPCServer` struct, which encapsulates the gRPC server configuration and runtime. The `NewGRPCServer` function is responsible for setting up all the necessary components and middleware for the gRPC server. The `Run` and `Shutdown` methods control the server's lifecycle.

## Symbols

### GRPCServer
#### Description
Represents the Flipt gRPC server, containing the gRPC server instance, logger, configuration, and shutdown functions.

#### Internal Logic
- Initializes various components based on the provided configuration
- Sets up middleware for authentication, authorization, error handling, and observability
- Configures storage, caching, and audit logging

### NewGRPCServer
#### Description
Constructs and configures a new GRPCServer instance.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ctx | context.Context | The context for the server setup |
| logger | *zap.Logger | The logger instance |
| cfg | *config.Config | The configuration for the server |
| info | info.Flipt | Information about the Flipt instance |
| forceMigrate | bool | Whether to force database migrations |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| *GRPCServer | *GRPCServer | The configured GRPCServer instance |
| error | error | Any error encountered during setup |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up the gRPC listener
2. Configures the storage backend based on the configuration
3. Initializes metrics and tracing if enabled
4. Sets up authentication and authorization
5. Configures audit logging
6. Initializes various services (flag management, evaluation, analytics, etc.)
7. Sets up gRPC server options and interceptors

### Run
#### Description
Starts the gRPC server and begins serving requests.

#### Internal Logic
Calls the `Serve` method on the underlying gRPC server with the configured listener.

### Shutdown
#### Description
Gracefully shuts down the gRPC server and its dependencies.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ctx | context.Context | The context for the shutdown operation |

#### Internal Logic
Executes all registered shutdown functions in reverse order.

## Dependencies
The file relies on various external libraries and internal packages for functionality such as gRPC, OpenTelemetry, authentication, authorization, and storage. Key dependencies include:
- gRPC and related middleware
- OpenTelemetry for metrics and tracing
- Zap for logging
- Internal Flipt packages for storage, authentication, authorization, and evaluation

## Error Handling
Error handling is implemented throughout the setup process. Errors are logged and propagated up the call stack. The `ErrorUnaryInterceptor` is used to handle and translate errors into appropriate gRPC status codes.

## Performance Considerations
- The server uses connection pooling for database connections
- Caching can be enabled to improve performance
- Tracing and metrics can be used to monitor and optimize performance

This gRPC server implementation provides a flexible and extensible foundation for Flipt's backend services, allowing for easy configuration and integration of various components and features.
