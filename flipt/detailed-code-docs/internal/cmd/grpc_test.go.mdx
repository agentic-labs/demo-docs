## High-level description
This file contains a unit test for the `NewGRPCServer` function in the `cmd` package. The test creates a temporary directory, sets up a configuration with a SQLite database, initializes a new gRPC server, and verifies that the server has non-empty service information.

### TestNewGRPCServer
#### Description
This function is a unit test for the `NewGRPCServer` function. It sets up a temporary environment, creates a configuration, initializes a gRPC server, and checks if the server has service information.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a temporary directory for the test.
2. Sets up a configuration with a SQLite database URL pointing to the temporary directory.
3. Creates a context with cancellation.
4. Calls `NewGRPCServer` with the test context, a test logger, the configuration, and empty Flipt info.
5. Sets up a cleanup function to shut down the server after the test.
6. Asserts that there's no error in creating the server.
7. Checks that the server's `GetServiceInfo()` method returns non-empty information.

#### Performance Considerations
The test uses a temporary directory and an in-memory SQLite database, which should be relatively fast for testing purposes.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| context | For creating a cancellable context |
| fmt | For string formatting |
| path/filepath | For file path operations |
| testing | For unit testing functionality |
| github.com/stretchr/testify/assert | For test assertions |
| go.flipt.io/flipt/internal/config | For configuration structures |
| go.flipt.io/flipt/internal/info | For Flipt information structures |
| go.uber.org/zap/zaptest | For creating a test logger |

## Error Handling
The test uses `assert.NoError` to check for errors when creating the gRPC server and shutting it down. If any errors occur, the test will fail.

This test ensures that the `NewGRPCServer` function can successfully create a gRPC server with the given configuration and that the server has some service information available. It's a basic smoke test to verify the server initialization process.
