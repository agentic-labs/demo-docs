Here's a high-level description and documentation of the `main.go` file in the `internal/cmd/protoc-gen-go-flipt-sdk` package:

## High-level description

This file contains the main function for a custom protocol buffer code generator plugin. It generates Go SDK code for the Flipt project based on the input protocol buffer definitions. The generator creates client-side SDK code for various services defined in the Flipt project, including authentication, evaluation, and metadata services.

## Code Structure

The main function orchestrates the code generation process. It uses the `protogen` package to parse the input protocol buffer definitions and generate corresponding Go code. The generator creates several files, including a main SDK file, individual service SDK files, and gRPC and HTTP client implementations.

## Symbols

### `main`

#### Description
The entry point of the code generator. It sets up the plugin options, processes the input protocol buffer files, and generates the SDK code.

#### Internal Logic
1. Parses command-line flags for gRPC API configuration.
2. Sets up protogen options and runs the code generation process.
3. Generates sub-SDK files for each service.
4. Generates the main SDK file.
5. Generates gRPC and HTTP client implementations.

### `generateSubSDK`

#### Description
Generates a .pb.sdk.go file for a single package within the Flipt SDK API.

#### Inputs
- `gen`: A pointer to the protogen.Plugin
- `file`: A pointer to the protogen.File being processed

#### Outputs
- `typ`: A string representing the generated type name
- `client`: A string representing the generated client name

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a new generated file for the package.
2. Generates the package declaration and imports.
3. Defines client structures and interfaces.
4. Generates methods for each service and RPC defined in the protocol buffer.

### `generateSDK`

#### Description
Generates the main SDK file (sdk.gen.go) containing the core SDK structure and initialization logic.

#### Inputs
- `gen`: A pointer to the protogen.Plugin

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates the main SDK file.
2. Generates package declaration and imports.
3. Defines the Transport interface and SDK structure.
4. Generates methods for creating client instances for each service.
5. Implements authentication-related functions.

### `authenticateFunction`

#### Description
Generates the `authenticate` function used for adding authentication information to the context.

#### Inputs
- `g`: A pointer to the protogen.GeneratedFile

#### Internal Logic
Generates a function that adds authentication headers to the outgoing gRPC context.

## Dependencies
The code relies on several standard Go libraries and the `google.golang.org/protobuf` package for protocol buffer handling.

## Configuration
The generator accepts a `grpc_api_configuration` flag to specify the path to the gRPC API configuration file.

## Error Handling
The code uses error checking and logging to handle potential issues during the code generation process. It returns errors to the protogen framework, which handles the overall error reporting.

This code generator is a crucial part of the Flipt project, automating the creation of client-side SDK code based on the project's protocol buffer definitions. It simplifies the process of integrating Flipt services into Go applications by providing type-safe and easy-to-use client libraries.
