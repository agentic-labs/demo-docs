## High-level description
This code is part of a protobuf code generator for creating a gRPC client SDK for Flipt. It generates a Go file that defines a `Transport` struct and methods for creating gRPC clients for various services defined in the protobuf files.

## Code Structure
The main function `generateGRPC` creates a new generated file and writes the necessary code for the gRPC transport layer. It iterates through the protobuf files and generates client methods for each service defined in those files.

## Symbols

### `generateGRPC`
#### Description
This function generates the gRPC transport layer code for the Flipt SDK.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| gen | *protogen.Plugin | The protogen plugin instance |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a new generated file named "grpc/grpc.sdk.gen.go".
2. Writes package declaration and imports.
3. Defines the `Transport` struct with a `ClientConnInterface` field.
4. Generates a `NewTransport` function.
5. Iterates through the protobuf files and generates client methods for each service.
6. Handles cases where a file has a single service or multiple services differently.

### `Transport` struct
#### Description
Represents the gRPC transport layer for the Flipt SDK.

#### Internal Logic
Contains a `ClientConnInterface` field to manage the gRPC connection.

### `NewTransport` function
#### Description
Creates a new `Transport` instance.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| cc | grpc.ClientConnInterface | The gRPC client connection interface |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Transport | Transport | A new Transport instance |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| google.golang.org/protobuf/compiler/protogen | Provides protobuf code generation utilities |
| google.golang.org/grpc | gRPC framework for Go |

## Helper Functions

### `importPackage`
#### Description
A helper function (not shown in the provided code) that likely manages importing packages and returns a function to reference symbols from that package.

### `relativeImport`
#### Description
A helper function (not shown in the provided code) that likely generates relative import paths for types defined in other protobuf files.

### `unexport`
#### Description
A helper function (not shown in the provided code) that likely converts an exported (capitalized) identifier to an unexported (lowercase) one.

## Generated Code Structure
The generated code includes:
1. A `Transport` struct implementing the SDK's `Transport` interface.
2. A `NewTransport` function to create a new `Transport` instance.
3. Methods for each service defined in the protobuf files, returning appropriate client interfaces.
4. For files with multiple services, a grouped client type is generated to implement the combined client interface.

## Performance Considerations
The generated code uses the gRPC `ClientConnInterface`, which allows for efficient reuse of a single connection for multiple service clients.

This code generator creates a clean and consistent gRPC client SDK for Flipt, making it easy for users to interact with the various Flipt services through a unified transport layer.
