Here's a high-level description and documentation of the `internal/cmd/authn.go` file:

## High-level description

This file contains functions for configuring and setting up authentication in Flipt. It provides implementations for both gRPC and HTTP authentication, including various authentication methods such as token-based, OIDC, GitHub, Kubernetes, and JWT. The code also handles authentication store setup, cleanup processes, and middleware configuration.

## Code Structure

The main functions in this file are:

1. `getAuthStore`: Sets up the authentication store based on the configuration.
2. `authenticationGRPC`: Configures gRPC authentication, including interceptors for different authentication methods.
3. `authenticationHTTPMount`: Sets up HTTP authentication routes and middleware.

These functions interact with various authentication methods and storage implementations to provide a comprehensive authentication system for Flipt.

## Symbols

### `getAuthStore`

#### Description
This function sets up the authentication store based on the provided configuration. It can use either an in-memory store or a database-backed store.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ctx | context.Context | The context for the operation |
| logger | *zap.Logger | Logger for logging operations |
| cfg | *config.Config | Configuration for the application |
| forceMigrate | bool | Flag to force database migration |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| store | storageauth.Store | The configured authentication store |
| shutdown | func(context.Context) error | Function to shut down the store |
| error | error | Any error encountered during setup |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates an in-memory store by default
2. If database authentication is required, it sets up a database connection
3. Creates a SQL-based auth store if using a database
4. Sets up cleanup service if configured

### `authenticationGRPC`

#### Description
This function configures gRPC authentication, including setting up various authentication methods and their corresponding interceptors.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ctx | context.Context | The context for the operation |
| logger | *zap.Logger | Logger for logging operations |
| cfg | *config.Config | Configuration for the application |
| forceMigrate | bool | Flag to force database migration |
| tokenDeletedEnabled | bool | Flag to enable token deletion auditing |
| authOpts | ...containers.Option[authmiddlewaregrpc.InterceptorOptions] | Options for the interceptor |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| register | grpcRegisterers | gRPC registerers for authentication services |
| interceptors | []grpc.UnaryServerInterceptor | List of gRPC interceptors |
| shutdown | func(context.Context) error | Function to shut down the authentication services |
| error | error | Any error encountered during setup |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up the authentication store
2. Configures various authentication methods (token, OIDC, GitHub, Kubernetes, JWT) based on the configuration
3. Sets up interceptors for each enabled authentication method
4. Configures enforcement middleware if authentication is required

### `authenticationHTTPMount`

#### Description
This function sets up HTTP routes and middleware for authentication.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ctx | context.Context | The context for the operation |
| logger | *zap.Logger | Logger for logging operations |
| cfg | config.AuthenticationConfig | Authentication configuration |
| r | chi.Router | HTTP router |
| conn | *grpc.ClientConn | gRPC client connection |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up HTTP middleware for authentication
2. Configures routes for various authentication methods (token, OIDC, GitHub, Kubernetes)
3. Mounts the authentication routes to the provided router

## Dependencies
The code relies on various internal packages for storage, configuration, and server implementations. It also uses external libraries such as `chi` for HTTP routing, `grpc` for gRPC functionality, and `zap` for logging.

This file is crucial for setting up and managing authentication in Flipt, providing a flexible system that can accommodate various authentication methods and storage backends.
