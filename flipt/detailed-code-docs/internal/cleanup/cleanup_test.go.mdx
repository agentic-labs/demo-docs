## High-level description
The `cleanup_test.go` file contains tests for the authentication cleanup service in the Flipt application. It specifically tests the service's ability to delete expired authentication tokens from the authentication store after a configured grace period.

### `TestCleanup`
#### Description
This function is a test that verifies the functionality of the authentication cleanup service. It creates both expiring and non-expiring authentication tokens, simulates multiple instances of the cleanup service running concurrently, and asserts that expired tokens are deleted after the grace period while non-expiring tokens persist.

#### Inputs
This function takes a single argument:

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `t` | `*testing.T` | The testing object used for reporting test results and logging. |

#### Outputs
The function does not return any values.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Setup:**
    - Creates a context, logger, in-memory authentication store, and an in-memory operational lock.
    - Defines an authentication configuration with all authentication methods enabled and sets a cleanup schedule with a 1-second interval and a 5-second grace period.
    - Creates a non-expiring authentication token and stores it in the authentication store.
2. **Simulate Service Runs:**
    - Runs five instances of the authentication cleanup service concurrently, simulating multiple instances sharing the same operational lock.
3. **Test Non-Expiring Token Persistence:**
    - Asserts that the non-expiring token created during setup still exists in the authentication store.
4. **Test Expiring Token Deletion:**
    - Iterates through each enabled authentication method that requires a database.
    - Creates an expiring authentication token with a 5-second expiry time.
    - Asserts that the token exists in the store.
    - Waits for 5 seconds (expiry time) and asserts that the token still exists due to the grace period.
    - Waits for another 10 seconds (grace period) and asserts that the token is now deleted.

## Side Effects
This test interacts with an in-memory authentication store and an in-memory operational lock, but these are isolated to the test environment and do not affect any external state.

## Dependencies
This test file depends on the following external libraries:

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `context` | Provides a mechanism for carrying request-scoped data and cancellation signals across API boundaries. |
