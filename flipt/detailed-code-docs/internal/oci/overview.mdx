## High-level description
This directory contains code for managing OCI (Open Container Initiative) operations within the Flipt project. It provides functionality for interacting with OCI registries, handling authentication, and managing feature bundles. The code supports various operations such as fetching, building, listing, and copying OCI artifacts, with a focus on Flipt feature files.

## What does it do?
The OCI package in this directory enables the following key functionalities:

1. Interact with OCI registries, including both local and remote repositories.
2. Authenticate with OCI registries, supporting static credentials and AWS ECR (Elastic Container Registry) authentication.
3. Fetch Flipt feature bundles from OCI registries.
4. Build and store Flipt feature bundles in OCI registries.
5. List available feature bundles in a registry.
6. Copy feature bundles between different references or registries.
7. Parse and handle OCI references (repository URLs and tags).
8. Manage OCI-specific media types and annotations for Flipt features.

## Entry points
The main entry point for using this package is the `Store` struct defined in `file.go`. This struct provides methods for interacting with OCI registries and managing Flipt feature bundles. Key methods include:

- `NewStore`: Creates a new OCI store instance.
- `Fetch`: Retrieves feature bundles from a registry.
- `Build`: Creates a new feature bundle from a source filesystem.
- `List`: Lists available feature bundles in a registry.
- `Copy`: Copies a feature bundle between references.

## Key Files
1. `file.go`: Defines the core `Store` struct and its methods for OCI operations.
2. `ecr/`: Subdirectory containing code for interacting with Amazon ECR.
3. `options.go`: Defines configuration options for the OCI store, including authentication methods.
4. `oci.go`: Contains constants and error definitions related to OCI operations.

## Dependencies
- `oras.land/oras-go/v2`: Used for OCI Registry As Storage (ORAS) operations.
- `github.com/opencontainers/go-digest`: For working with content digests.
- `github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/specs-go/v1`: For OCI image specifications.
- `github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2`: For AWS SDK operations, particularly with ECR.
- `go.uber.org/zap`: For logging.

## Configuration
The OCI package can be configured using the following options:

1. Authentication:
   - Static credentials: Using `WithStaticCredentials(user, pass)`.
   - AWS ECR credentials: Using `WithAWSECRCredentials(endpoint)`.

2. OCI Manifest version: Set using `WithManifestVersion(version)`.

3. Store options: Configured when creating a new store with `NewStore(logger, dir, opts...)`.

The package uses environment variables and AWS configuration files for AWS ECR authentication when applicable.

This OCI package provides a flexible and extensible way to manage Flipt feature bundles using OCI registries, supporting various authentication methods and registry types.
