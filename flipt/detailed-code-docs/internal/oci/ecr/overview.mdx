## High-level description
This directory contains code for interacting with Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR), both private and public. It provides functionality for retrieving and caching ECR authorization tokens, which are necessary for authenticating with ECR when pushing or pulling container images.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory enables applications to:
1. Authenticate with both private and public Amazon ECR repositories.
2. Retrieve authorization tokens from ECR, which are required for pushing and pulling images.
3. Cache these authorization tokens to reduce the number of API calls to ECR.
4. Handle different types of ECR endpoints (public and private) transparently.
5. Integrate ECR authentication with the ORAS (OCI Registry As Storage) library.

## Entry points
The main entry point for using this package is the `CredentialsStore` struct defined in `credentials_store.go`. This struct provides methods for retrieving and caching ECR credentials. The `Credential` function in `ecr.go` serves as an adapter to integrate the `CredentialsStore` with the ORAS library for authentication.

## Key Files
1. `credentials_store.go`: Defines the `CredentialsStore` struct for managing ECR credentials.
2. `ecr.go`: Contains interfaces and implementations for interacting with both private and public ECR repositories.
3. `credentials_store_test.go`: Contains unit tests for the `CredentialsStore`.
4. `ecr_test.go`: Contains unit tests for the ECR client implementations.

## Dependencies
- `github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/config`: Used for loading AWS configuration.
- `github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/service/ecr`: AWS SDK for interacting with private ECR.
- `github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/service/ecrpublic`: AWS SDK for interacting with public ECR.
- `oras.land/oras-go/v2/registry/remote/auth`: Used for integrating with ORAS authentication.

## Configuration
The package uses AWS SDK configuration, which can be customized through environment variables or AWS configuration files. The `CredentialsStore` can be configured with a custom endpoint if needed.

Key configurable aspects:
- ECR endpoint: Can be specified when creating a new `CredentialsStore`.
- AWS credentials: Handled by the AWS SDK, can be configured through environment variables or AWS configuration files.

This package provides a robust solution for applications that need to interact with Amazon ECR, handling authentication and token management in a way that's both efficient (through caching) and flexible (supporting both public and private repositories).
