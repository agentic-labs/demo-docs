title: "mock_Client_test.go"

## High-level description
The code defines a mock implementation of the `Client` interface in the `ecr` package. This mock client is used for testing purposes, allowing developers to simulate the behavior of the real ECR client without actually interacting with AWS ECR.

## Code Structure
The `MockClient` struct embeds the `mock.Mock` struct from the `github.com/stretchr/testify/mock` package. It provides a single mock function, `GetAuthorizationToken`, which simulates the behavior of the real `GetAuthorizationToken` function in the `Client` interface.

## Symbols

### `MockClient`
#### Description
A mock implementation of the `Client` interface for testing purposes.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

### `GetAuthorizationToken`
#### Description
Simulates the behavior of the `GetAuthorizationToken` function in the `Client` interface. It returns a predefined authorization token, expiration time, and error based on the mock setup.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ctx | context.Context | The context for the request. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| string | string | The simulated authorization token. |
| time.Time | time.Time | The simulated expiration time of the token. |
| error | error | The simulated error, if any. |

#### Internal Logic
The function uses the `Called` method of the embedded `mock.Mock` struct to record the call and retrieve the predefined return values. If no return values are specified, it panics. It then returns the simulated authorization token, expiration time, and error.

### `NewMockClient`
#### Description
Creates a new instance of `MockClient` and registers it with the provided testing interface. It also sets up a cleanup function to assert the mock's expectations.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| t | interface{ mock.TestingT Cleanup(func()) } | The testing interface, typically a `*testing.T` value. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| *MockClient | *MockClient | A pointer to the newly created `MockClient` instance. |

#### Internal Logic
The function creates a new `MockClient` instance and calls the `Test` method of the embedded `mock.Mock` struct to register the mock with the testing interface. It then defines a cleanup function using `t.Cleanup` that calls `AssertExpectations` on the mock to ensure all expected calls were made. Finally, it returns the newly created `MockClient` instance.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| github.com/stretchr/testify/mock | Provides mocking functionality for testing. |

## Error Handling
The `GetAuthorizationToken` mock function can be configured to return a simulated error, allowing developers to test error handling in their code.

## Logging
No logging mechanisms are implemented in this mock client.
