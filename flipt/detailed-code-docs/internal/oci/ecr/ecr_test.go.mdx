## High-level description
The code defines unit tests for private and public ECR clients, ensuring they can correctly retrieve and handle AWS ECR authorization tokens. 

These tests cover scenarios like error handling, empty authorization data, and successful token retrieval, ultimately validating the client's ability to interact with AWS ECR for authentication.

## Code Structure
This file contains unit tests for the `privateClient` and `publicClient` structs, which are defined in the same package. Each test suite (`TestPrivateClient` and `TestPublicClient`) focuses on a specific client type and includes multiple test cases covering different scenarios.

## Symbols
### `TestPrivateClient`
#### Description
This test suite verifies the behavior of the `privateClient` struct, which interacts with the private AWS ECR service.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a test suite, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a test suite, not a function.

#### Internal Logic
The test suite includes the following test cases:

- **on error**: Checks that the client correctly propagates errors encountered while fetching authorization tokens.
- **empty auth**: Verifies the client returns an error when the AWS ECR response contains empty authorization data.
- **nil auth token**: Ensures the client handles cases where the authorization token within the response data is nil.
- **get auth token**: Tests the successful retrieval of an authorization token, validating both the token value and its expiration time.
- **default client**: Confirms an error occurs when attempting to use a `privateClient` with an uninitialized client.

### `TestPublicClient`
#### Description
This test suite validates the functionality of the `publicClient` struct, responsible for interacting with the public AWS ECR service.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a test suite, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a test suite, not a function.

#### Internal Logic
The test suite comprises the following test cases:

- **on error**: Asserts the client appropriately handles errors during authorization token retrieval.
- **nil auth token**: Checks for proper error handling when the received authorization token is nil.
- **get auth token**: Tests the successful acquisition of an authorization token, verifying both its value and expiration.
- **default client**: Confirms an error is returned when using a `publicClient` without a properly initialized client.
