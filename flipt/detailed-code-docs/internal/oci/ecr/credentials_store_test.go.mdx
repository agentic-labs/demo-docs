## High-level description
The `credentials_store_test.go` file contains unit tests for the `CredentialsStore` struct in the `ecr` package. These tests cover the extraction of credentials from ECR authorization tokens, caching of credentials, and error handling.

## Code Structure
The code consists of three test functions: `TestDefaultClientFunc`, `TestECRCredential`, and `TestCredential`. 

- `TestDefaultClientFunc` verifies the correct client type is returned based on the server address.
- `TestECRCredential` tests the `extractCredential` method with various valid and invalid authorization tokens.
- `TestCredential` tests the `Get` method, including error handling, credential extraction, and caching.

## Symbols
### `TestDefaultClientFunc`
#### Description
This function tests the `defaultClientFunc` to ensure it returns the correct client type (`privateClient` or `publicClient`) based on the provided server address.

#### Inputs
This function takes a `testing.T` object as input, which is used for reporting test results and errors.

#### Outputs
This function does not return any values.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Arrange:** N/A
2. **Act:** The `defaultClientFunc` is called with a private and a public ECR server address.
3. **Assert:** `require.IsType` is used to assert that the returned client type matches the expected type (`privateClient` for private addresses and `publicClient` for public addresses).

### `TestECRCredential`
#### Description
This function tests the `extractCredential` method of the `CredentialsStore` struct. It verifies that the method correctly extracts username and password from valid ECR authorization tokens and returns appropriate errors for invalid tokens.

#### Inputs
This function takes a `testing.T` object as input, which is used for reporting test results and errors.

#### Outputs
This function does not return any values.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Arrange:** The test iterates through a table of test cases, each containing a test name, an ECR authorization token, expected username, expected password, and expected error.
2. **Act:** For each test case, a new `CredentialsStore` object is created, and its `extractCredential` method is called with the test token.
3. **Assert:** The actual error returned by `extractCredential` is compared to the expected error using `assert.Equal`. The extracted username and password are also compared to the expected values using `assert.Equal`.

### `TestCredential`
#### Description
This function tests the `Get` method of the `CredentialsStore` struct. It covers scenarios like retrieving credentials from the cache, fetching new credentials from ECR, handling errors during credential retrieval and extraction, and caching retrieved credentials.

#### Inputs
This function takes a `testing.T` object as input, which is used for reporting test results and errors.

#### Outputs
This function does not return any values.

#### Internal Logic
The function contains three subtests:

**1. "on error"**
   - **Arrange:** A mock `Client` is created that returns an `io.ErrUnexpectedEOF` error when `GetAuthorizationToken` is called. A `CredentialsStore` is initialized with the mock client.
   - **Act:** The `Get` method of the `CredentialsStore` is called.
   - **Assert:** `assert.ErrorIs` is used to verify that the returned error is an `io.ErrUnexpectedEOF`.

**2. "on extract failure"**
   - **Arrange:** A mock `Client` is created that returns an invalid authorization token. A `CredentialsStore` is initialized with the mock client.
   - **Act:** The `Get` method of the `CredentialsStore` is called.
   - **Assert:** `assert.Error` is used to verify that an error occurred during credential extraction.

**3. "on success with cached"**
   - **Arrange:** A mock `Client` is created that returns a valid authorization token. A `CredentialsStore` is initialized with the mock client.
   - **Act:** The `Get` method of the `CredentialsStore` is called three times.
   - **Assert:** For each call, `assert.NoError` verifies that no error occurred. `assert.Equal` is used to check if the returned username and password match the expected values from the valid token. This subtest also implicitly verifies that the credentials are retrieved from the cache on subsequent calls after the first successful retrieval.
