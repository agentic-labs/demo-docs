## High-level description
This directory contains test data for the OCI (Oracle Cloud Infrastructure) component of an internal system, specifically focusing on feature flag configurations using Flipt, a feature flag management system. The directory includes three YAML files that define various feature flag settings for different environments and scenarios.

## What does it do?
The files in this directory serve as configuration templates for feature flags in different environments. They demonstrate how to:

1. Set up a basic Flipt configuration structure.
2. Define boolean feature flags with default states.
3. Configure rollout strategies for feature flags, including:
   - Enabling or disabling flags for specific user segments.
   - Implementing percentage-based rollouts to gradually release features.
4. Organize feature flags into namespaces (e.g., "production").
5. Include and combine configurations from multiple files.

These configurations allow developers to control the visibility and behavior of features in their application, enabling practices like A/B testing, gradual rollouts, and quick feature toggles without code deployments.

## Key Files

1. `.flipt.yml`
   - This is the main configuration file for Flipt in the test environment.
   - It includes settings from two other files: `default.yml` and `production.yml`.
   - Purpose: To demonstrate how to combine multiple configuration files in a Flipt setup.

2. `default.yml`
   - Defines a single boolean feature flag with various rollout conditions.
   - Purpose: To showcase different ways of configuring a feature flag, including segment-based and percentage-based rollouts.

3. `production.yml`
   - Defines feature flags for a "production" namespace.
   - Includes a boolean flag similar to the one in `default.yml`.
   - Purpose: To illustrate how feature flags can be organized into namespaces and configured for a production environment.

## Configuration

The configuration files use YAML format and define the following key elements:

1. In `.flipt.yml`:
   ```yaml
   version: 1.0
   include:
     - default.yml
     - production.yml
   ```
   This structure allows for modular configuration by including other YAML files.

2. In `default.yml` and `production.yml`:
   ```yaml
   flags:
     - key: flag_boolean
       name: FLAG_BOOLEAN
       type: BOOLEAN_FLAG_TYPE
       description: Boolean Flag Description
       enabled: false
       rollouts:
         - segment:
             key: segment_001
         - segment:
             key: segment_002
             value: false
         - segment:
             key: segment_003
             value: true
         - segment:
             key: segment_004
         - threshold:
             percentage: 50
             value: true
   ```
   This structure defines a feature flag with its properties and rollout conditions.

   Key configuration fields:
   - `key`: Unique identifier for the flag
   - `name`: Display name for the flag
   - `type`: Type of the flag (e.g., BOOLEAN_FLAG_TYPE)
   - `description`: Purpose of the flag
   - `enabled`: Default state of the flag
   - `rollouts`: List of rollout conditions, including segment-based and threshold-based rules

3. In `production.yml`:
   ```yaml
   production:
     namespace: production
     flags:
       # Flag definitions similar to default.yml
   ```
   This structure organizes flags under a specific namespace.

These configurations allow for fine-grained control over feature releases, enabling developers to target specific user segments or gradually roll out features to a percentage of users. The test data provides a comprehensive example of how to set up and manage feature flags in different environments using Flipt.
