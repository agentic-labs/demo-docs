title: ".flipt.yml"
---

## High-level description
This YAML file defines the configuration for Flipt, a feature flag management system, specifically for a test environment related to OCI (Oracle Cloud Infrastructure). It includes configurations from two other files: `default.yml` and `production.yml`.

## Code Structure
This configuration file uses YAML's inclusion feature to combine settings from multiple files. It first includes a `default.yml` file, which likely contains general settings. Then, it includes a `production.yml` file, suggesting that this test environment mirrors the production setup.

## Symbols
### `version: 1.0`
#### Description
Specifies the version of the Flipt configuration file format being used.

### `include:`
#### Description
Indicates that the configuration should include settings from other YAML files.

#### Internal Logic
This section lists the files to be included. Each file's settings are merged into the main configuration. The order of inclusion matters, with later files potentially overriding settings from earlier ones.

#### `- default.yml`
  - Includes settings from a file named `default.yml`.
#### `- production.yml`
  - Includes settings from a file named `production.yml`.
