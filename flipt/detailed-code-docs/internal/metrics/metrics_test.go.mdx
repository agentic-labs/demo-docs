## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for the `GetExporter` function in the `metrics` package. The tests cover various configurations for different metrics exporters, including Prometheus and OTLP (OpenTelemetry Protocol) with different endpoint types.

### `TestGetxporter`
#### Description
This function is a test suite for the `GetExporter` function. It tests different configurations for metrics exporters and verifies that the function returns the expected results.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| t | *testing.T | The testing object provided by the Go testing framework |

#### Internal Logic
1. The test defines a slice of test cases, each with a name, configuration, and expected error.
2. It iterates through each test case using a sub-test.
3. For each sub-test:
   - It resets the `metricExpOnce` sync.Once{} to ensure a fresh state for each test.
   - Calls `GetExporter` with the test case configuration.
   - Checks if the returned error matches the expected error (if any).
   - If no error is expected, it verifies that the returned exporter and cleanup function are not nil.
   - Sets up a cleanup function to call the returned cleanup function.

#### Test Cases
1. Prometheus exporter
2. OTLP HTTP exporter
3. OTLP HTTPS exporter
4. OTLP GRPC exporter
5. OTLP default exporter (assumed to be GRPC)
6. Unsupported exporter (expected to return an error)

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| context | Provides context for cancellation and timeouts |
| errors | Used for error handling and comparison |
| sync | Used for sync.Once{} to reset state between tests |
| testing | Go testing framework |
| github.com/stretchr/testify/assert | Provides assertion functions for testing |
| go.flipt.io/flipt/internal/config | Imports the configuration types used in the tests |

## Notes
- The test uses the `assert` package from `testify` for more expressive assertions.
- The `metricExpOnce` variable is reset before each test to ensure isolation between test cases.
- The test covers various OTLP endpoint types (HTTP, HTTPS, GRPC) to ensure proper handling of different URL schemes.
- The cleanup function returned by `GetExporter` is called in a deferred function to ensure proper resource cleanup after each test.

This test suite ensures that the `GetExporter` function correctly handles different metrics exporter configurations and returns appropriate exporters and cleanup functions or errors as expected.
