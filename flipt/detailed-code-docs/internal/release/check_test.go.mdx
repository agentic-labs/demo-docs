## High-level description
The `check_test.go` file within the `internal/release` package houses unit tests for functions related to checking for new releases of the software. This includes mocking external dependencies like the GitHub API and testing various scenarios like successful release retrieval, error handling, and version comparison.

## Code Structure
The code defines several test functions, each testing a specific aspect of the release checking functionality. It uses mock structures to simulate responses from external services and asserts expected behavior based on different input scenarios.

## Symbols

### `TestGetLatestRelease`
#### Description
This test function verifies the `getLatestRelease` function's behavior under different scenarios, including successful retrieval of the latest release information and handling errors during the process.

#### Inputs
- None

#### Outputs
- None

#### Internal Logic
The test iterates through a set of predefined test cases, each defining a specific scenario:
- **"success"**: Simulates a successful retrieval of the latest release information from the mocked GitHub API and asserts that the returned data matches the expected values.
- **"error"**: Simulates an error during the release retrieval process and asserts that the returned error message is as expected.

### `TestCheck`
#### Description
This test function verifies the `check` function, which compares the current software version with the latest release version and determines if an update is available.

#### Inputs
- None

#### Outputs
- None

#### Internal Logic
The test iterates through predefined test cases, each simulating a different version comparison scenario:
- **"latest version"**: Simulates a scenario where the current version matches the latest release version and asserts that the `UpdateAvailable` flag is false.
- **"new version"**: Simulates a scenario where a newer release is available and asserts that the `UpdateAvailable` flag is true and the latest version information is correctly populated.

### `TestIs`
#### Description
This test function verifies the `Is` function, which checks if a given version string represents a valid release version format.

#### Inputs
- None

#### Outputs
- None

#### Internal Logic
The test iterates through a set of version strings, each representing a different format (valid release, development, snapshot, etc.), and asserts whether the `Is` function correctly identifies them as valid or invalid release versions.
