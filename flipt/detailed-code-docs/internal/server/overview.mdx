Here's a summary of the `internal/server` directory:

## High-level description
The `internal/server` directory contains the core implementation of the Flipt server, including the gRPC service definitions, evaluation logic, and various components for handling authentication, authorization, analytics, and auditing. It provides the main functionality for managing feature flags, segments, rules, and evaluations in the Flipt system.

## What does it do?
This directory implements several key functionalities:

1. Feature Flag Management: Provides APIs for creating, updating, deleting, and listing feature flags and their variants.
2. Segment Management: Handles the creation and management of user segments and their constraints.
3. Rule Management: Implements logic for creating and managing rules that determine when flags are enabled for specific segments.
4. Flag Evaluation: Contains the core logic for evaluating feature flags based on rules and user context.
5. Authentication and Authorization: Implements various authentication methods and authorization checks for API access.
6. Analytics: Provides functionality for tracking and analyzing flag evaluations.
7. Auditing: Implements an audit logging system for tracking important actions and changes.
8. OpenFeature Remote Evaluation Protocol (OFREP) Support: Implements a server that supports the OFREP specification for remote flag evaluation.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this package is the `Server` struct defined in `server.go`. This struct implements the gRPC service interfaces and ties together all the components of the Flipt server. The `New` function in `server.go` creates a new instance of the server, injecting dependencies like the logger and storage interface.

Key methods and files include:
- `server.go`: Defines the main `Server` struct and its initialization.
- `evaluator.go`: Implements the core flag evaluation logic.
- `flag.go`, `segment.go`, `rule.go`, `rollout.go`: Implement CRUD operations for their respective entities.
- `middleware/`: Contains gRPC and HTTP middleware for request processing.
- `authn/`: Implements authentication mechanisms.
- `authz/`: Implements authorization checks.
- `analytics/`: Provides analytics functionality for flag evaluations.
- `audit/`: Implements the audit logging system.
- `ofrep/`: Implements the OpenFeature Remote Evaluation Protocol server.

## Key Files
1. `server.go`: Main server implementation and initialization.
2. `evaluator.go`: Core flag evaluation logic.
3. `flag.go`: Flag management operations.
4. `segment.go`: Segment management operations.
5. `rule.go`: Rule management operations.
6. `rollout.go`: Rollout management operations.
7. `namespace.go`: Namespace management operations.
8. `middleware/grpc/middleware.go`: gRPC middleware implementations.
9. `middleware/http/middleware.go`: HTTP middleware implementations.
10. `authn/server.go`: Authentication server implementation.
11. `authz/engine/bundle/engine.go`: Authorization engine implementation.
12. `analytics/server.go`: Analytics server implementation.
13. `audit/audit.go`: Audit logging implementation.
14. `ofrep/server.go`: OFREP server implementation.

## Dependencies
The server relies on several external libraries and internal Flipt packages:

1. `google.golang.org/grpc`: For implementing the gRPC server.
2. `go.uber.org/zap`: For structured logging.
3. `github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2`: For the gRPC-HTTP gateway.
4. `go.opentelemetry.io/otel`: For distributed tracing and metrics.
5. `github.com/open-policy-agent/opa`: For policy-based authorization.
6. Internal packages like `storage`, `config`, and various RPC definitions.

## Configuration
The server components are typically configured through the main Flipt configuration system, which is passed to the various constructors when initializing the server and its subcomponents. This includes settings for:

1. Storage backend configuration
2. Authentication methods and settings
3. Authorization policies
4. Analytics and auditing options
5. OFREP server settings

In summary, the `internal/server` directory provides a comprehensive implementation of the Flipt server, handling all aspects of feature flag management, evaluation, authentication, authorization, and related functionality. It serves as the core of the Flipt system, integrating various components to provide a robust feature flagging service.
