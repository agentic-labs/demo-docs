## High-level description
The code defines a test suite for the `Server` struct in the `flipt/internal/server/authn/public` package. It specifically tests the `ListAuthenticationMethods` function, ensuring it correctly reports enabled authentication methods and their associated metadata based on the provided configuration.

## Code Structure
The code primarily uses a table-driven test approach. It defines a series of test cases, each with a different configuration and expected output. The `responseBuilder` function helps construct the expected `ListAuthenticationMethodsResponse` based on the enabled methods and their metadata.

## Symbols
### `Test_Server`
#### Description
This function defines a table-driven test suite for the `Server` struct's `ListAuthenticationMethods` function.

#### Inputs
This function takes no inputs as it is a test function.

#### Outputs
This function has no outputs as it is a test function.

#### Internal Logic
The test iterates through a table of test cases. Each case sets up a different authentication configuration (`conf`) and simulates an incoming request context (`ctx`). It then calls the `ListAuthenticationMethods` function and compares the returned response with the expected response built using the `responseBuilder` function. Assertions are used to verify the correctness of the response, including the enabled status and metadata of each authentication method.

### `methods`
#### Description
A struct used internally by the `responseBuilder` function to represent different authentication methods and their associated information.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a struct definition, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a struct definition, not a function.

#### Internal Logic
The struct contains fields for each authentication method supported by Flipt (e.g., `token`, `github`, `oidc`, `kubernetes`, `jwt`, `cloud`). Each field is of type `*auth.MethodInfo` and holds information about the method's enabled status, session compatibility, and additional metadata.

### `responseBuilder`
#### Description
This helper function constructs an `auth.ListAuthenticationMethodsResponse` based on the provided configuration and a modifier function.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| t | testing.TB | The testing object used for reporting errors. |
| fn | func(*methods) | A function that can modify the default methods configuration. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| *auth.ListAuthenticationMethodsResponse | *auth.ListAuthenticationMethodsResponse | The constructed `ListAuthenticationMethodsResponse` object. |

#### Internal Logic
The function first initializes a `methods` struct with default values for all supported authentication methods. It then calls the provided modifier function (`fn`) to allow customization of the enabled status and metadata of specific methods. Finally, it constructs and returns an `auth.ListAuthenticationMethodsResponse` populated with the configured methods.
