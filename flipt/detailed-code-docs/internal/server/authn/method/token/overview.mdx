## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of a token-based authentication method for the Flipt server. It provides a gRPC server that manages static authentication tokens, allowing for the creation and management of tokens used to authenticate with the Flipt API.

## What does it do?
The token authentication method allows users to create and manage static authentication tokens for the Flipt API. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

1. Token Creation: Users can request the creation of new authentication tokens. The server generates a unique client token and stores it along with associated metadata (such as expiration time and description) in the authentication store.

2. Token Management: While not explicitly implemented in the provided code, the structure suggests that the server can handle other token-related operations like retrieval and deletion.

3. Namespace Scoping: This authentication method does not support namespace-scoped authentication, which means tokens are valid across all namespaces in the Flipt instance.

4. gRPC Integration: The implementation is designed to work as part of a gRPC server, allowing it to be easily integrated into the larger Flipt server architecture.

## Key Files

### server.go
This file contains the main implementation of the token authentication method. Key components include:

- `Server` struct: Implements the `auth.AuthenticationMethodTokenServiceServer` interface, handling gRPC requests for token authentication.
- `NewServer` function: Constructs and configures a new `Server` instance.
- `CreateToken` method: Handles the creation of new authentication tokens.
- `AllowsNamespaceScopedAuthentication` method: Always returns `false`, indicating that this method doesn't support namespace-scoped authentication.

### server_test.go
This file contains the test suite for the `Server` implementation. It includes:

- `TestServer` function: Sets up a test environment with a gRPC server and client, and runs multiple test cases to verify the server's functionality.
- Test cases for token creation, invalid input handling, and namespace-scoped authentication behavior.

## Dependencies
The implementation relies on several external libraries and internal packages:

1. gRPC and Protocol Buffers:
   - `google.golang.org/grpc`: For implementing the gRPC server and client.
   - `google.golang.org/protobuf`: For working with Protocol Buffer messages.

2. Logging:
   - `go.uber.org/zap`: For structured logging.

3. Internal Flipt packages:
   - `go.flipt.io/flipt/internal/storage/authn`: For the authentication store interface.
   - `go.flipt.io/flipt/rpc/flipt/auth`: For gRPC service definitions related to authentication.

4. Testing libraries:
   - `github.com/stretchr/testify`: For assertions in tests.
   - `github.com/google/go-cmp`: For deep comparisons in tests.

## Configuration
The token authentication method doesn't appear to use any external configuration files or environment variables. Its behavior is primarily determined by the `storageauth.Store` implementation provided during server initialization.

Key configurable aspects include:

1. Logger: A `*zap.Logger` instance is provided during server initialization for logging purposes.
2. Authentication Store: A `storageauth.Store` implementation is provided to handle the persistence and retrieval of authentication data.

These configurations are set when creating a new `Server` instance using the `NewServer` function:

```go
func NewServer(logger *zap.Logger, store storageauth.Store) *Server {
    return &Server{
        logger: logger,
        store:  store,
    }
}
```

The specific implementation of the authentication store (e.g., in-memory, database-backed) can be chosen when setting up the larger Flipt server, allowing for flexibility in how authentication data is stored and managed.
