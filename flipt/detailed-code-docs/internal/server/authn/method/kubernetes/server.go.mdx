## High-level description
The `kubernetes` package implements the "kubernetes" authentication method for Flipt, allowing services within the same Kubernetes cluster to authenticate using their service account tokens. This method grants access to any service in the cluster upon successful token verification.

## Code Structure
The `Server` struct is the core component, handling token verification and client token generation. It utilizes a `tokenVerifier` interface for abstracting token verification logic, and a `storageauth.Store` for managing authentication data.

## References
- `storageauth.Store`: Used for creating and managing authentication data.
- `config.AuthenticationConfig`: Provides configuration settings for authentication methods.

## Symbols

### Server
#### Description
The `Server` struct implements the gRPC server for the "kubernetes" authentication method. It verifies service account tokens and generates Flipt client tokens.

#### Inputs
This struct does not have explicit inputs. It relies on the provided `logger`, `store`, and `config` during initialization.

#### Outputs
This struct does not have explicit outputs. It exposes gRPC methods for service account verification.

#### Internal Logic
The `VerifyServiceAccount` method performs the following steps:
1. Verifies the provided service account token using the `tokenVerifier`.
2. If the token is valid, it extracts identity information from the token claims.
3. Creates a Flipt client token with an expiration matching the service account token, associating it with the extracted identity.
4. Returns the generated client token and authentication details.

## Dependencies
- `go.flipt.io/flipt/internal/config`: Provides configuration settings.
- `go.flipt.io/flipt/internal/storage/authn`: Offers storage and management for authentication data.
- `go.flipt.io/flipt/rpc/flipt/auth`: Defines the gRPC service for authentication.
- `go.uber.org/zap`: Provides logging functionality.
- `google.golang.org/grpc`: Enables gRPC server and client implementations.
- `google.golang.org/protobuf/types/known/timestamppb`: Offers utilities for working with protobuf timestamps.

## Error Handling
The code uses `error` values for error handling. Errors encountered during token verification or authentication data storage are propagated to the caller.
