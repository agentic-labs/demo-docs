title: "http.go"

## High-level description
The `http.go` file in the `internal/server/authn/method/kubernetes/testing` package provides utilities for starting and stopping an HTTP server for testing purposes. This server is used to test the Kubernetes authentication method for Flipt.

## Code Structure
The `StartHTTPServer` function creates and starts an HTTP server. It utilizes the `GRPCServer` from the same package for the underlying gRPC communication. The `Stop` method gracefully stops the running HTTP server.

## References
- `GRPCServer`: This symbol, defined in the same package, represents the underlying gRPC server used by the HTTP server.

## Symbols

### `StartHTTPServer`
#### Description
This function creates, configures, and starts an HTTP server for testing the Kubernetes authentication method. It sets up a gateway ServeMux, registers the Kubernetes authentication service handler, and mounts the authentication routes.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| t | `*testing.T` | The testing object used for reporting test failures. |
| ctx | `context.Context` | The context for the server. |
| logger | `*zap.Logger` | The logger instance for recording server activity. |
| conf | `config.AuthenticationConfig` | The authentication configuration for the server. |
| router | `chi.Router` | The router to which the authentication routes are mounted. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `*HTTPServer` |  | A pointer to the started HTTP server. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a new `gateway.GatewayServeMux` and an `HTTPServer` instance, initializing its `GRPCServer` using the `StartGRPCServer` function.
2. Registers the `auth.AuthenticationMethodKubernetesServiceHandler` with the ServeMux, connecting it to the gRPC server.
3. Mounts the `/auth/v1` path on the provided router, pointing it to the configured ServeMux.
4. Returns the initialized `HTTPServer` instance.

### `(*HTTPServer).Stop`
#### Description
This method gracefully stops the running HTTP server by stopping its underlying `GRPCServer`.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `error` |  | An error object if the server fails to stop, otherwise nil. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls the `Stop` method of the embedded `GRPCServer` to gracefully shut it down.
2. Returns the error returned by the `GRPCServer.Stop` method, if any.
