## High-level description
The `internal/server/authn/method` directory contains implementations of various authentication methods for the Flipt server. It includes support for GitHub, OIDC, Kubernetes, and token-based authentication. The directory also provides HTTP middleware for handling authentication in a gRPC gateway and utility functions for state validation in OAuth flows.

## What does it do?
This directory implements multiple authentication methods for Flipt:

1. GitHub Authentication: Handles OAuth2 flow with GitHub, including user information retrieval and optional organization/team-based access restrictions.

2. OIDC Authentication: Implements OpenID Connect authentication flow, supporting both implicit and PKCE flows.

3. Kubernetes Authentication: Verifies Kubernetes service account tokens for services running in the same cluster as Flipt.

4. Token-based Authentication: Manages static authentication tokens for API access.

5. HTTP Middleware: Provides functionality for cookie management, request prefix forwarding, and state parameter handling in the authentication flow.

6. Utility Functions: Includes helpers for state validation in OAuth callbacks and metadata key constants.

## Key Files

1. `github/server.go`: Implements GitHub authentication flow.
2. `oidc/server.go`: Implements OIDC authentication flow.
3. `kubernetes/server.go`: Implements Kubernetes authentication method.
4. `token/server.go`: Implements token-based authentication.
5. `http.go`: Provides HTTP middleware for authentication handling.
6. `util.go`: Contains utility functions for state validation.
7. `metadata.go`: Defines constants for storage metadata keys.

## Dependencies
The authentication methods rely on several key dependencies:

- `github.com/coreos/go-oidc/v3/oidc`: For OIDC token verification.
- `golang.org/x/oauth2`: For OAuth2 client implementation.
- `go.uber.org/zap`: For structured logging.
- `google.golang.org/grpc`: For gRPC server and client implementations.
- `go.flipt.io/flipt/internal/storage/authn`: For authentication data storage.
- `go.flipt.io/flipt/rpc/flipt/auth`: For gRPC service definitions related to authentication.

## Configuration
Each authentication method uses specific configuration options:

1. GitHub: Requires client ID, secret, redirect address, and optional allowed organizations/teams.
2. OIDC: Needs provider endpoints, client ID, secret, allowed scopes, and redirect URIs.
3. Kubernetes: Uses CA certificate path, service account token path, and discovery URL.
4. Token: Primarily configured through the provided authentication store implementation.

The HTTP middleware is configured with authentication session parameters like token and state lifetimes, domain, and security settings.

In summary, this directory provides a comprehensive set of authentication methods for Flipt, allowing flexible and secure user authentication through various providers and mechanisms. The implementations are designed to integrate seamlessly with Flipt's gRPC-based architecture and provide robust error handling and logging capabilities.
