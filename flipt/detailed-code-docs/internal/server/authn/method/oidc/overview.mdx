## High-level description
The `internal/server/authn/method/oidc` directory implements the OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication method for Flipt. It provides a server that handles the authorization URL generation and callback logic for the OIDC/OAuth flow, allowing users to authenticate with Flipt using their existing identity provider accounts.

## What does it do?
This directory implements the OIDC authentication workflow for Flipt:

1. It generates an authorization URL for a specified OIDC provider when requested.
2. It handles the callback from the OIDC provider after user authentication.
3. It exchanges the authorization code for an ID token.
4. It verifies the ID token and extracts user claims.
5. It creates a Flipt client token based on the authenticated user information.
6. It provides utilities for testing the OIDC authentication flow in isolation.

The implementation supports both implicit flow and PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) flow for enhanced security.

## Entry points
The main entry point for the OIDC authentication method is the `Server` struct in `server.go`. This struct implements the gRPC service for OIDC authentication, providing methods for generating authorization URLs and handling callbacks.

The flow of control typically goes as follows:
1. The `AuthorizeURL` method is called to generate a URL for the user to authenticate with the OIDC provider.
2. After the user authenticates, the provider redirects to the `Callback` method, which handles the token exchange and user authentication.

For testing purposes, the `testing` subdirectory provides utilities to set up both gRPC and HTTP test servers that simulate the OIDC authentication flow.

## Key Files

### server.go
This file contains the core implementation of the OIDC authentication method:

- `Server` struct: Implements the OIDC authentication server.
- `AuthorizeURL` method: Generates the authorization URL for the OIDC provider.
- `Callback` method: Handles the callback from the OIDC provider, including token exchange and user authentication.
- Helper functions for configuring OIDC providers and handling user claims.

### server_test.go
This file contains integration tests for the OIDC server implementation:

- `Test_Server_ImplicitFlow`: Tests the OIDC implicit flow authentication process.
- `Test_Server_PKCE`: Tests the OIDC authentication process using the PKCE flow.
- `testOIDCFlow`: A helper function that performs the actual OIDC authentication flow for testing.

### testing/grpc.go and testing/http.go
These files provide utilities for setting up test environments:

- `GRPCServer` and related functions: Set up a gRPC server for OIDC authentication testing.
- `StartHTTPServer` and related functions: Set up an HTTP server that simulates Flipt's OIDC authentication flow.

## Dependencies
The OIDC implementation relies on several key dependencies:

- `github.com/coreos/go-oidc/v3/oidc`: Used for interacting with OIDC providers.
- `github.com/hashicorp/cap/oidc`: Provides OIDC-related utilities.
- `go.flipt.io/flipt/errors`: Used for defining custom errors.
- `go.flipt.io/flipt/internal/config`: Used for accessing the authentication configuration.
- `go.flipt.io/flipt/internal/storage/authn`: Used for interacting with the authentication store.
- `go.flipt.io/flipt/rpc/flipt/auth`: Defines gRPC services and messages for authentication.
- `go.uber.org/zap`: Used for logging.
- `google.golang.org/grpc`: Used for gRPC communication.

Testing utilities additionally use:
- `github.com/go-chi/chi`: For HTTP routing in test servers.
- `github.com/stretchr/testify`: For test assertions.

## Configuration
The OIDC authentication method is configured using the `config.AuthenticationConfig` struct, which includes settings such as:

- OIDC provider endpoints
- Client ID and secret
- Allowed scopes
- Redirect URIs

These configuration options allow for flexible setup of different OIDC providers and authentication flows.

In summary, the `internal/server/authn/method/oidc` directory provides a comprehensive implementation of OIDC authentication for Flipt, including the core authentication logic, testing utilities, and integration tests to ensure the reliability of the authentication process.
