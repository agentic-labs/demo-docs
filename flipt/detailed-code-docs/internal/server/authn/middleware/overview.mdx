## High-level description

This directory contains middleware implementations for authentication and authorization in the Flipt server. It includes both gRPC and HTTP middleware, providing a comprehensive solution for securing API endpoints. The middleware handles various authentication methods, including JWT, client tokens, and OIDC, as well as authorization checks based on email patterns and namespace matching.

## What does it do?

The middleware in this directory performs several key functions:

1. Authentication:
   - Validates JWT tokens in request headers
   - Authenticates requests using client tokens
   - Supports OIDC authentication
   - Manages authentication cookies for HTTP requests

2. Authorization:
   - Checks if authenticated users' emails match allowed patterns
   - Verifies if users have access to requested namespaces

3. Request processing:
   - Extracts authentication information from request metadata (gRPC) or cookies (HTTP)
   - Adds authentication data to the request context
   - Enforces authentication requirements on protected endpoints

4. Error handling:
   - Returns appropriate error codes for authentication and authorization failures
   - Clears authentication cookies for unauthenticated HTTP responses

5. Logout handling:
   - Intercepts logout requests and clears all authentication-related cookies

## Entry points

The main entry points for this middleware are:

1. gRPC middleware (in `grpc/middleware.go`):
   - `AuthenticationRequiredInterceptor`
   - `JWTAuthenticationInterceptor`
   - `ClientTokenAuthenticationInterceptor`
   - `EmailMatchingInterceptor`
   - `NamespaceMatchingInterceptor`

2. HTTP middleware (in `http/middleware.go`):
   - `NewHTTPMiddleware`

The gRPC middleware is designed to be chained together using the `grpc-ecosystem/go-grpc-middleware` package, while the HTTP middleware integrates with the standard Go HTTP server.

## Key Files

1. `common/common.go`:
   - Defines the `TokenCookieKey` constant used for storing the Flipt client token in HTTP cookies

2. `grpc/middleware.go`:
   - Contains the core implementation of gRPC interceptors
   - Includes utility functions for extracting and managing authentication data

3. `grpc/middleware_test.go`:
   - Comprehensive unit tests for the gRPC interceptors and utility functions

4. `http/middleware.go`:
   - Implements HTTP middleware for cookie management and logout handling
   - Includes error handling for unauthenticated responses

5. `http/middleware_test.go`:
   - Unit tests for the HTTP middleware implementation

## Dependencies

The middleware relies on several external libraries:

1. `go.uber.org/zap`: For structured logging
2. `google.golang.org/grpc`: For gRPC server and client interactions
3. `github.com/grpc-ecosystem/go-grpc-middleware`: For chaining multiple gRPC interceptors
4. `go.flipt.io/flipt/rpc/flipt/auth`: For authentication-related message types
5. `github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/runtime`: For gRPC-Gateway runtime utilities

## Configuration

The middleware can be configured using the following:

1. gRPC middleware:
   - `InterceptorOptions` struct for customizing authentication behavior
   - JWT validation rules
   - Allowed email patterns for OIDC authentication

Example configuration for gRPC middleware:

```go
options := []containers.Option[InterceptorOptions]{
    WithServerSkipsAuthentication(myServer),
}

jwtInterceptor := JWTAuthenticationInterceptor(
    logger,
    jwtValidator,
    jwt.Expected{Issuer: "https://example.com"},
    options...,
)
```

2. HTTP middleware:
   - `config.AuthenticationSession` for cookie domain and lifetime settings

Example configuration for HTTP middleware:

```go
authSessionConfig := config.AuthenticationSession{
    CookieDomain: "example.com",
    Lifetime:     3600, // in seconds
}

httpMiddleware := NewHTTPMiddleware(authSessionConfig)
```

The middleware provides a flexible and robust authentication and authorization layer for both gRPC and HTTP endpoints in the Flipt server, ensuring secure access to API resources.
