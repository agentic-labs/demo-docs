## High-level description
The `grpc_middleware` package provides gRPC interceptors for authentication and authorization in the Flipt API. It includes interceptors for JWT authentication, client token authentication, email matching, and namespace matching. These interceptors are used to secure gRPC endpoints and ensure that only authorized clients can access protected resources.

## Code Structure
The code defines several test functions for different authentication and authorization interceptors. Each test function uses a table-driven approach to test various scenarios and edge cases. The interceptors themselves are defined in the same package but in separate files.

## References
- `jwt.Expected`: Represents the expected claims of a JWT token.
- `authmiddlewaregrpc.ContextWithAuthentication`: A function to add authentication information to a context.
- `authrpc.Authentication`: Represents authentication information.

## Symbols

### `TestJWTAuthenticationInterceptor`
#### Description
Tests the `JWTAuthenticationInterceptor` function, which is responsible for authenticating requests based on JWT tokens.

#### Inputs
- `t *testing.T`: The testing object.

#### Outputs
None.

#### Internal Logic
The test function iterates through a table of test cases, each defining a specific scenario for JWT authentication. For each test case, it sets up a mock gRPC server and a JWT validator. It then creates a request context with specific metadata, including an "Authorization" header containing a JWT token. The interceptor is then invoked with the context, request, server info, and a mock handler. The test asserts that the expected error is returned and that the authentication information is correctly extracted from the JWT token.

### `TestClientTokenAuthenticationInterceptor`
#### Description
Tests the `ClientTokenAuthenticationInterceptor` function, which is responsible for authenticating requests based on client tokens.

#### Inputs
- `t *testing.T`: The testing object.

#### Outputs
None.

#### Internal Logic
The test function sets up an in-memory authentication store and creates a client token. It then iterates through a table of test cases, each defining a specific scenario for client token authentication. For each test case, it creates a request context with specific metadata, including an "Authorization" header or a "grpcgateway-cookie" header containing the client token. The interceptor is then invoked with the context, request, server info, and a mock handler. The test asserts that the expected error is returned and that the authentication information is correctly retrieved from the authentication store.

### `TestEmailMatchingInterceptorWithNoAuth`
#### Description
Tests the `EmailMatchingInterceptor` function when no authentication information is present in the context.

#### Inputs
- `t *testing.T`: The testing object.

#### Outputs
None.

#### Internal Logic
The test function sets up a mock gRPC server and creates a request context without any authentication information. It then defines an email matching interceptor with a regex pattern. The test asserts that the interceptor panics when invoked, as it expects authentication information to be present in the context.

### `TestEmailMatchingInterceptor`
#### Description
Tests the `EmailMatchingInterceptor` function, which is responsible for verifying if the authenticated user's email matches a set of allowed email patterns.

#### Inputs
- `t *testing.T`: The testing object.

#### Outputs
None.

#### Internal Logic
The test function sets up an in-memory authentication store and creates client tokens with different authentication methods and metadata. It then iterates through a table of test cases, each defining a specific scenario for email matching. For each test case, it creates a request context with specific metadata, including an "Authorization" header containing a client token. The interceptor is then invoked with the context, request, server info, and a mock handler. The test asserts that the expected error is returned based on whether the authenticated user's email matches the allowed email patterns.

### `TestNamespaceMatchingInterceptorWithNoAuth`
#### Description
Tests the `NamespaceMatchingInterceptor` function when no authentication information is present in the context.

#### Inputs
- `t *testing.T`: The testing object.

#### Outputs
None.

#### Internal Logic
The test function sets up a mock gRPC server and creates a request context without any authentication information. It then defines a namespace matching interceptor. The test asserts that the interceptor panics when invoked, as it expects authentication information to be present in the context.

### `TestNamespaceMatchingInterceptor`
#### Description
Tests the `NamespaceMatchingInterceptor` function, which is responsible for verifying if the authenticated user has access to the requested namespace.

#### Inputs
- `t *testing.T`: The testing object.

#### Outputs
None.

#### Internal Logic
The test function iterates through a table of test cases, each defining a specific scenario for namespace matching. For each test case, it sets up an in-memory authentication store, creates a client token with specific metadata, and defines a mock gRPC server. The interceptor is then invoked with the context, request, server info, and a mock handler. The test asserts that the expected error is returned based on whether the authenticated user has access to the requested namespace.
