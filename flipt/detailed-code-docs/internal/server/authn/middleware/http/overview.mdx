## High-level description
This directory contains HTTP middleware implementations for the Flipt authentication service. The middleware handles cookie management for logout and unauthenticated responses, ensuring appropriate cookies are cleared when a user logs out or when an unauthenticated response is returned due to invalid cookie-based authentication.

## What does it do?
The middleware in this directory performs two main functions:

1. Logout handling: When a user logs out (by sending a PUT request to `/auth/v1/self/expire`), the middleware intercepts the request and clears all authentication-related cookies.

2. Unauthenticated response handling: When an unauthenticated error occurs due to an invalid authentication cookie, the middleware clears the relevant cookies before passing the error to the default error handler.

These functions help maintain the security and integrity of the authentication process by ensuring that invalid or expired authentication tokens are properly cleared from the client's browser.

## Key Files

### middleware.go
This file contains the core implementation of the HTTP middleware. It defines the `Middleware` struct and its associated methods:

- `NewHTTPMiddleware`: Creates a new middleware instance with the provided authentication session configuration.
- `Handler`: Intercepts HTTP requests and clears cookies on logout.
- `ErrorHandler`: Intercepts error responses and clears cookies for unauthenticated errors.
- `clearAllCookies`: Helper method to clear authentication-related cookies.

### middleware_test.go
This file contains unit tests for the middleware implementation. It includes tests for:

- `TestHandler`: Verifies that the `Handler` function correctly handles logout requests and clears cookies.
- `TestErrorHandler`: Ensures that the `ErrorHandler` function properly clears cookies when an unauthenticated error occurs.

## Dependencies
- `github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/runtime`: Used for gRPC-Gateway runtime utilities.
- `go.flipt.io/flipt/internal/config`: Provides configuration for the authentication sessions.
- `go.flipt.io/flipt/internal/server/authn/middleware/common`: Contains common middleware utilities and constants.
- `google.golang.org/grpc/codes`: Used for gRPC status codes.
- `google.golang.org/grpc/status`: Provides gRPC status utilities.

## Configuration
The middleware uses the `config.AuthenticationSession` configuration, which includes settings for cookie domains and lifetimes. This configuration is passed to the `NewHTTPMiddleware` function when creating a new middleware instance.

Key configurable fields include:
- Cookie domain
- Cookie lifetime

The middleware also uses constants from the `middlewarecommon` package, such as `TokenCookieKey`, which represents the key used for storing the authentication token in a cookie.

In summary, this directory provides a crucial component of the Flipt authentication system, managing HTTP cookies to ensure proper logout functionality and handling of unauthenticated responses. The implementation is well-tested and configurable, allowing for flexibility in different deployment scenarios.
