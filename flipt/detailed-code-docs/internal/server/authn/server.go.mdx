## High-level description
The `server.go` file in the `internal/server/authn` package defines the `Server` struct, which implements the `auth.AuthenticationServiceServer` interface. This server is responsible for handling authentication-related requests, such as retrieving, listing, deleting, and expiring authentication data. It interacts with the underlying authentication storage to manage authentication information.

## Code Structure
The `Server` struct relies on the `storageauth.Store` interface for interacting with the authentication storage. It uses the `authmiddlewaregrpc` package to retrieve authentication information from the request context. The server also utilizes the `audit` package for logging audit events related to authentication actions.

## References

- `authmiddlewaregrpc`: Package for managing authentication middleware in gRPC.
- `audit`: Package for logging audit events.

### `Server`
#### Description
The `Server` struct implements the `auth.AuthenticationServiceServer` interface and handles authentication-related requests.

#### Inputs
This struct does not have explicit inputs. It receives requests through the gRPC server.

#### Outputs
This struct does not have explicit outputs. It sends responses through the gRPC server.

#### Internal Logic
The `Server` struct implements the following methods:
- `GetAuthenticationSelf`: Retrieves the authentication information from the request context.
- `GetAuthentication`: Retrieves the authentication information from the storage based on the provided ID.
- `ListAuthentications`: Retrieves a list of authentications based on the provided filter and pagination parameters.
- `DeleteAuthentication`: Deletes the authentication information from the storage based on the provided ID.
- `ExpireAuthenticationSelf`: Expires the authentication information retrieved from the request context.

### `GetActorFromAuthentication`
#### Description
This function takes an `auth.Authentication` object and an IP address string as input and returns an `audit.Actor` object. It extracts relevant information from the authentication object and constructs an actor object representing the authenticated user for audit logging purposes.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| authentication | `*auth.Authentication` | The authentication object containing user information. |
| ip | `string` | The IP address of the client. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| actor | `*audit.Actor` | The actor object representing the authenticated user. |

#### Internal Logic
The function determines the authentication method used (e.g., OIDC, JWT, GitHub) and extracts relevant user information from the authentication object's metadata based on the method. It then constructs an `audit.Actor` object with the extracted information and the provided IP address.

### `ActorFromContext`
#### Description
This function extracts the `audit.Actor` from the provided context.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ctx | `context.Context` | The context containing the request information. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| actor | `*audit.Actor` | The actor object representing the authenticated user. |

#### Internal Logic
The function first attempts to retrieve the authentication information from the context using `authmiddlewaregrpc.GetAuthenticationFrom`. If authentication information is found, it calls `GetActorFromAuthentication` to construct the actor object. Otherwise, it creates an actor object with "none" authentication and the client's IP address.

## Side Effects
The `DeleteAuthentication` and `ExpireAuthenticationSelf` methods modify the authentication data stored in the underlying storage.

## Error Handling
The server methods return errors using the `error` interface. The errors are typically propagated from the underlying storage or authentication middleware.

## Logging
The server uses a `*zap.Logger` to log debug and error messages.
