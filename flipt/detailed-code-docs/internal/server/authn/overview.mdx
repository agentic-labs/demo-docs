## High-level description
The `internal/server/authn` directory contains the implementation of the authentication server and related components for the Flipt application. It provides various authentication methods, middleware for both gRPC and HTTP, and a public authentication service. The directory is structured to handle different aspects of authentication, including method-specific implementations, middleware for request processing, and a public-facing service for listing available authentication methods.

## What does it do?
This directory implements a comprehensive authentication system for Flipt, including:

1. Multiple authentication methods:
   - GitHub OAuth
   - OpenID Connect (OIDC)
   - Kubernetes service account tokens
   - Static token-based authentication
   - JWT validation

2. Middleware for both gRPC and HTTP:
   - Authentication validation
   - Authorization checks (email pattern matching, namespace access)
   - Request processing (extracting auth info, adding to context)
   - Error handling

3. Public authentication service:
   - Listing available authentication methods
   - Providing method-specific information

4. Core authentication server:
   - Managing authentication data (retrieve, list, delete, expire)
   - Interacting with underlying storage

The system is designed to be flexible and configurable, allowing for easy addition or removal of authentication methods based on the application's needs.

## Entry points
The main entry points for this authentication system are:

1. `server.go`: Implements the core `Server` struct, which handles authentication-related requests and interacts with the storage layer.

2. `method/` directory: Contains implementations for specific authentication methods (GitHub, OIDC, Kubernetes, token-based).

3. `middleware/` directory: Provides gRPC and HTTP middleware for authentication and authorization.

4. `public/server.go`: Implements the public authentication service for listing available methods.

## Key Files
1. `server.go`: Core authentication server implementation.
2. `method/github/server.go`: GitHub authentication implementation.
3. `method/oidc/server.go`: OIDC authentication implementation.
4. `method/kubernetes/server.go`: Kubernetes authentication implementation.
5. `method/token/server.go`: Token-based authentication implementation.
6. `middleware/grpc/middleware.go`: gRPC authentication middleware.
7. `middleware/http/middleware.go`: HTTP authentication middleware.
8. `public/server.go`: Public authentication service implementation.

## Dependencies
The authentication system relies on several key dependencies:

- `github.com/coreos/go-oidc/v3/oidc`: For OIDC token verification.
- `golang.org/x/oauth2`: For OAuth2 client implementation.
- `go.uber.org/zap`: For structured logging.
- `google.golang.org/grpc`: For gRPC server and client implementations.
- `github.com/grpc-ecosystem/go-grpc-middleware`: For chaining multiple gRPC interceptors.
- `github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/runtime`: For gRPC-Gateway runtime utilities.
- `go.flipt.io/flipt/internal/storage/authn`: For authentication data storage.
- `go.flipt.io/flipt/rpc/flipt/auth`: For gRPC service definitions related to authentication.

## Configuration
The authentication system is highly configurable, with options for each authentication method and middleware component:

1. Authentication methods:
   - GitHub: Client ID, secret, redirect address, allowed organizations/teams.
   - OIDC: Provider endpoints, client ID, secret, allowed scopes, redirect URIs.
   - Kubernetes: CA certificate path, service account token path, discovery URL.
   - Token: Configured through the provided authentication store implementation.

2. Middleware:
   - gRPC: `InterceptorOptions` struct for customizing authentication behavior, JWT validation rules, allowed email patterns.
   - HTTP: Cookie domain and lifetime settings.

3. Public authentication service:
   - Uses `config.AuthenticationConfig` to determine which methods are available and their specific configurations.

Example configuration for gRPC middleware:

```go
options := []containers.Option[InterceptorOptions]{
    WithServerSkipsAuthentication(myServer),
}

jwtInterceptor := JWTAuthenticationInterceptor(
    logger,
    jwtValidator,
    jwt.Expected{Issuer: "https://example.com"},
    options...,
)
```

Example configuration for HTTP middleware:

```go
authSessionConfig := config.AuthenticationSession{
    CookieDomain: "example.com",
    Lifetime:     3600, // in seconds
}

httpMiddleware := NewHTTPMiddleware(authSessionConfig)
```

The authentication system in the `internal/server/authn` directory provides a robust and flexible solution for handling various authentication methods, middleware processing, and public-facing services. It is designed to integrate seamlessly with Flipt's gRPC-based architecture while offering comprehensive error handling and logging capabilities.
