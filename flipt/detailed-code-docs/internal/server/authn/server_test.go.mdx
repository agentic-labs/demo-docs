## High-level description
The code in `server_test.go` defines unit tests for the `authn.Server` which implements the `rpcauth.AuthenticationServiceServer` interface. These tests cover various functionalities of the authentication server, including creating, retrieving, listing, deleting, and expiring authentication tokens.

## Code Structure
The code consists of a single test function `TestServer` which sets up a gRPC server with the `authn.Server` implementation and a client to interact with it. The test function then defines several subtests to cover different aspects of the server's functionality.

## References
- `authn.Server`: The authentication server implementation being tested.
- `rpcauth.AuthenticationServiceServer`: The gRPC interface implemented by the authentication server.
- `storageauth.CreateAuthenticationRequest`: A request to create a new authentication token.
- `rpcauth.Authentication`: A representation of an authentication token.
- `memory.NewStore`: An in-memory store used for testing.

## Symbols

### `TestServer`
#### Description
This function defines a suite of tests for the `authn.Server` implementation. It sets up a gRPC server and client, creates an authentication token, and then tests various operations on the token.

#### Inputs
This function takes a single input:
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| t | *testing.T | The testing object used for reporting test results. |

#### Outputs
This function does not return any outputs.

#### Internal Logic
The test function performs the following steps:
1. **Setup:**
    - Creates a logger, an in-memory store, and a bufconn listener.
    - Starts a gRPC server with the `authn.Server` implementation and interceptors for authentication and error handling.
    - Creates a client token and a corresponding authentication object in the store.
    - Establishes a gRPC connection to the server.
2. **Subtests:**
    - **GetAuthenticationSelf:** Tests retrieving the authentication object associated with the client token.
    - **GetAuthentication:** Tests retrieving an authentication object by its ID.
    - **ListAuthentications:** Tests listing all authentication objects.
    - **DeleteAuthentication:** Tests deleting an authentication object.
    - **ExpireAuthenticationSelf:** Tests expiring the authentication object associated with the client token.
3. **Shutdown:**
    - Stops the gRPC server and checks for any errors.

### `Test_Server_DisallowsNamespaceScopedAuthentication`
#### Description
This function tests that the `authn.Server` implementation does not allow namespace-scoped authentication.

#### Inputs
This function takes a single input:
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| t | *testing.T | The testing object used for reporting test results. |

#### Outputs
This function does not return any outputs.

#### Internal Logic
The test function performs the following steps:
1. **Setup:**
    - Creates a logger and an in-memory store.
    - Creates an instance of the `authn.Server`.
2. **Assertion:**
    - Asserts that the `AllowsNamespaceScopedAuthentication` method of the server returns `false`.

## Error Handling
The tests use the `require` and `assert` packages from `testify` to check for errors and assert expected values. The `middlewaregrpc.ErrorUnaryInterceptor` is used on the server to intercept errors and return appropriate gRPC status codes.

## Logging
The tests use a `zaptest.NewLogger` to create a logger for debugging purposes.
