## High-level description
The code defines a test suite, `TestGetProviderConfiguration`, which verifies the behavior of the `GetProviderConfiguration` function in the `ofrep` package. This function is responsible for returning the provider's configuration, including its capabilities like cache invalidation and flag evaluation.

## Code Structure
The `TestGetProviderConfiguration` function uses a table-driven approach to test different scenarios. Each test case defines a specific configuration and the expected response from the `GetProviderConfiguration` function. The test suite iterates through each test case, creates a new instance of the `ofrep` server with the specified configuration, and then calls the `GetProviderConfiguration` function. Finally, it asserts that the returned response matches the expected response.

## Symbols
### `TestGetProviderConfiguration`
#### Description
This function is a test suite that verifies the behavior of the `GetProviderConfiguration` function.

#### Inputs
This is a test function, so it takes `*testing.T` as input.

#### Outputs
The test function does not return any output. It uses the `require` package for assertions.

#### Internal Logic
The test suite uses a table-driven approach to test different scenarios. Each test case in the `testCases` slice defines:
* `name`: The name of the test case.
* `cfg`: A `config.CacheConfig` struct representing the cache configuration.
* `expectedResp`: The expected `ofrep.GetProviderConfigurationResponse` for the given configuration.

For each test case, the test suite:
1. **Arranges** the test by creating a new mock bridge using `NewMockBridge(t)` and a new instance of the `ofrep` server using `New(zaptest.NewLogger(t), tc.cfg, b)`.
2. **Acts** by calling the `GetProviderConfiguration` function with a context and an empty `ofrep.GetProviderConfigurationRequest`.
3. **Asserts** that the function returns no error using `require.NoError(t, err)` and that the returned response matches the expected response using `require.Equal(t, tc.expectedResp, resp)`.

The test cases cover scenarios where the cache is enabled and disabled, verifying that the `MinPollingIntervalMs` field in the response is set correctly based on the cache configuration.
