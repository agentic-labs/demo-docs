## High-level description
The `server.go` file defines the gRPC server implementation for the OpenFeature Remote Evaluation Protocol (OFREP) in the Flipt application. It acts as a bridge between the OFREP specification and Flipt's internal flag evaluation logic.

## Code Structure
The `Server` struct implements the `ofrep.OFREPServiceServer` interface, which defines the gRPC methods for OFREP. The `New` function creates a new instance of the server, injecting dependencies like a logger, cache configuration, and an evaluation bridge. The `RegisterGRPC` function registers the server with a gRPC server instance.

## References
- `ofrep`: This refers to the `go.flipt.io/flipt/rpc/flipt/ofrep` package, which contains the generated gRPC code for the OFREP specification.
- `config.CacheConfig`: This refers to the cache configuration used by the server.
- `Bridge`: This refers to the `Bridge` interface defined in the same file, which abstracts the interaction with Flipt's internal flag evaluation logic.

## Symbols

### `Server`
#### Description
The `Server` struct represents the gRPC server for OFREP. It holds references to a logger, cache configuration, and an evaluation bridge.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a struct definition, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a struct definition, not a function.

#### Internal Logic
The `Server` struct doesn't have any complex internal logic. It simply holds dependencies and implements the `ofrep.OFREPServiceServer` interface.

### `New`
#### Description
The `New` function constructs a new `Server` instance with the provided logger, cache configuration, and evaluation bridge.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| logger | `*zap.Logger` | A logger instance for recording server activity. |
| cacheCfg | `config.CacheConfig` | The cache configuration to use. |
| bridge | `Bridge` | An implementation of the `Bridge` interface for interacting with Flipt's internal flag evaluation logic. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `*Server` |  | A pointer to a new `Server` instance. |

#### Internal Logic
The function simply initializes a new `Server` struct with the provided dependencies.

### `RegisterGRPC`
#### Description
The `RegisterGRPC` function registers the `Server` as an `ofrep.OFREPServiceServer` with the provided gRPC server.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| server | `*grpc.Server` | A pointer to a gRPC server instance. |

#### Outputs
N/A

#### Internal Logic
The function calls `ofrep.RegisterOFREPServiceServer`, passing in the gRPC server and the `Server` instance itself. This registers the server to handle incoming OFREP requests.

### `EvaluationBridgeInput`
#### Description
The `EvaluationBridgeInput` struct defines the input data required by the `Bridge` for flag evaluation.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a struct definition, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a struct definition, not a function.

#### Internal Logic
The struct contains fields for the flag key, namespace key, entity ID, and evaluation context.

### `EvaluationBridgeOutput`
#### Description
The `EvaluationBridgeOutput` struct defines the output data returned by the `Bridge` after flag evaluation.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a struct definition, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a struct definition, not a function.

#### Internal Logic
The struct contains fields for the flag key, evaluation reason, variant, value, and metadata.

### `Bridge`
#### Description
The `Bridge` interface defines the contract for interacting with Flipt's internal flag evaluation logic.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is an interface definition, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is an interface definition, not a function.

#### Internal Logic
The interface defines a single method, `OFREPFlagEvaluation`, which takes an `EvaluationBridgeInput` and returns an `EvaluationBridgeOutput` and an error.
