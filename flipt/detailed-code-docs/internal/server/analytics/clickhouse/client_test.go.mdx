## High-level description
The code defines a single unit test function, `TestGetStepFromDuration`, which aims to verify the logic of the `getStepFromDuration` function. The `getStepFromDuration` function itself is not present in this file.

## Symbols
### `TestGetStepFromDuration`
#### Description
This unit test verifies the functionality of the `getStepFromDuration` function, which is expected to determine an appropriate time interval step based on a given duration. 

#### Inputs
This function takes no direct inputs. It defines test cases within its scope.

#### Outputs
This function does not return any values. It uses the `assert` package for test assertions.

#### Internal Logic
The test function iterates through a set of predefined test cases, each specifying a duration and the expected interval step. For each case:

1. **Arrange:** The test case provides a specific duration and the expected `Step` struct values.
2. **Act:** The `getStepFromDuration` function is called with the test case duration.
3. **Assert:** The test compares the returned `Step` struct's `intervalStep` and `intervalValue` fields against the expected values using `assert.Equal`.

The test cases cover scenarios with durations of 1 hour, 3 hours, and 24 hours, expecting different interval steps and values for each.
