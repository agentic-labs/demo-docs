## High-level description
The code defines a test suite, `TestSinkSpanExporter`, which verifies the functionality of the `NewAnalyticsSinkSpanExporter`. This exporter is responsible for extracting evaluation response data from OpenTelemetry spans and sending it to an analytics sink for further processing.

## Code Structure
The code defines a test function `TestSinkSpanExporter` that sets up a sample analytics sink and a span exporter. It then creates a sample span containing mock evaluation response data and simulates the span ending. Finally, it asserts that the sample sink receives the expected evaluation response data.

## Symbols
### `TestSinkSpanExporter`
#### Description
This function is a test function that verifies the functionality of the `NewAnalyticsSinkSpanExporter`.

#### Inputs
This function takes no inputs.

#### Outputs
This function has no outputs.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Arrange:**
    - Create a sample sink `ss` with a buffered channel to receive evaluation responses.
    - Create an instance of the `analyticsSinkSpanExporter` using the sample sink.
    - Create a new tracer provider and register the `analyticsSinkSpanExporter` as a span processor.
    - Create a new tracer `tr` and start a new span `span`.
    - Define sample evaluation responses and marshal them into JSON format.
    - Create OpenTelemetry attributes containing the JSON-formatted evaluation responses.
2. **Act:**
    - Add an event with the evaluation response attributes to the span.
    - End the span, triggering the span processor.
3. **Assert:**
    - Set up a timeout context to prevent the test from hanging.
    - Use a select statement to wait for either the evaluation responses to be received on the sample sink's channel or for the timeout.
    - If the evaluation responses are received:
        - Assert that the number of responses is as expected.
        - Assert that the values of the received evaluation response match the defined sample responses.
    - If the timeout occurs, fail the test.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| context | Used for managing the timeout context. |
| encoding/json | Used for marshaling and unmarshaling JSON data. |
| testing | Used for defining the test function and making assertions. |
| time | Used for setting timeouts and retrieving timestamps. |
| github.com/stretchr/testify/assert | Used for making assertions in the test function. |
| github.com/stretchr/testify/require | Used for making assertions that, if failed, stop the test execution. |
| go.opentelemetry.io/otel/attribute | Used for defining OpenTelemetry attributes. |
| go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/trace | Used for creating tracer providers, tracers, and span processors. |
| go.opentelemetry.io/otel/trace | Used for creating spans and adding events to them. |
| go.uber.org/zap | Used for creating a no-op logger. |

## Error Handling
The test function uses `require.NoError` to check for errors during the JSON marshaling process. If an error occurs, the test will fail immediately.

## Logging
The code uses a no-op logger (`zap.NewNop()`) for the `analyticsSinkSpanExporter`, so no actual logging takes place.
