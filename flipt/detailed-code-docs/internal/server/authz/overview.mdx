## High-level description
The `internal/server/authz` directory contains the implementation of an authorization system for the Flipt project. It provides a flexible and powerful mechanism for enforcing access control policies using Open Policy Agent (OPA) and supports both Rego-based policies and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) configurations.

## What does it do?
This authorization system performs several key functions:

1. Defines an interface (`Verifier`) for authorization checks.
2. Implements an authorization engine using Open Policy Agent (OPA) that:
   - Initializes with provided configurations
   - Loads and evaluates policies from various sources (local filesystem or cloud storage)
   - Supports different user roles and permissions
   - Periodically updates policies and data
3. Provides a gRPC middleware that:
   - Intercepts incoming gRPC requests
   - Determines if authorization should be applied
   - Retrieves authentication information
   - Verifies if the requester is allowed to perform the requested action
   - Allows or denies requests based on authorization results

In simpler terms, it acts as a sophisticated gatekeeper for Flipt, deciding whether a user or system can perform a specific action based on predefined rules and policies.

## Entry points
The main entry points for this package are:

1. The `Verifier` interface in `authz.go`, which defines the contract for authorization logic.
2. The `Engine` struct in `engine/bundle/engine.go` and `engine/rego/engine.go`, which implements the OPA-based authorization engine.
3. The `AuthorizationRequiredInterceptor` function in `middleware/middleware.go`, which provides the gRPC middleware for authorization.

## Key Files
1. `authz.go`: Defines the `Verifier` interface.
2. `engine/bundle/engine.go`: Implements the OPA bundle-based authorization engine.
3. `engine/rego/engine.go`: Implements the Rego-based authorization engine.
4. `engine/rego/source/cloud/cloud.go`: Implements cloud-based policy and data sources.
5. `engine/rego/source/filesystem/filesystem.go`: Implements filesystem-based policy and data sources.
6. `middleware/middleware.go`: Contains the gRPC middleware implementation.

## Dependencies
The authorization system relies on several external libraries and frameworks:

1. Open Policy Agent (OPA) SDK and related packages
2. Uber's Zap logger
3. gRPC
4. Various internal Flipt packages

## Configuration
The authorization system can be configured through the Flipt configuration (`config.Config`). Key configurable aspects include:

1. Authorization backend type (local files or cloud-based storage)
2. Policy and data file paths
3. Cloud backend settings (for cloud-based backends)
4. Middleware options for skipping authorization on specific servers

Example configuration for the authorization engine:

```yaml
authorization:
  backend:
    type: s3
    region: us-west-2
    bucket: my-policy-bucket
  policy:
    path: /policies/authz.rego
  data:
    path: /data/rbac.json
```

Example usage of the gRPC middleware:

```go
interceptor := AuthorizationRequiredInterceptor(
    logger,
    policyVerifier,
    WithServerSkipsAuthorization(someServer),
)
```

This authorization system provides a powerful and flexible way to implement complex authorization rules in the Flipt server, supporting both bundle-based and Rego-based policies, as well as local and cloud-based policy management.
