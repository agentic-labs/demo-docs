## High-level description
This code defines the `source` package, which contains types and errors related to sources of policy and data for the authorization engine. It introduces the `ErrNotModified` error and defines the `Hash` type for identifying source data versions.

## Code Structure
This code defines a package-level error variable and a type definition. These are independent symbols and not directly related.

## Symbols
### `ErrNotModified`
#### Description
This is a variable of type `error` that represents an error indicating that the data from a source has not been modified since the last retrieval attempt.

#### Internal Logic
This error is initialized with the message "not modified".

### `Hash`
#### Description
This is a type alias for a byte slice (`[]byte`). It is used to represent a hash value, likely for identifying the version of data retrieved from a source.
