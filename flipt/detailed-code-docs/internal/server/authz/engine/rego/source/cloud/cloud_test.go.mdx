## High-level description
The `cloud_test.go` file contains unit tests for the `fetch` function in the `cloud` package, which is part of the Flipt server's authorization engine. The tests cover various scenarios, including successful fetches, handling of different ETag values, and error responses from the server.

## Symbols
### `TestFetch`
#### Description
`TestFetch` is a table-driven unit test function that tests the `fetch` function. It simulates different server responses and verifies the behavior of the `fetch` function in each scenario.

#### Inputs
This function takes no explicit inputs as it is a test function.

#### Outputs
This function has no explicit outputs as it is a test function.

#### Internal Logic
The test function iterates through a table of test cases, each defining a specific scenario:
1. **Arrange:** Sets up a test HTTP server using `httptest.NewServer` that simulates different responses based on the test case.
2. **Act:** Calls the `fetch` function with a context, a simulated ETag value, the test server's URL, and an API key.
3. **Assert:** Verifies the following:
    - The expected error matches the actual error returned by `fetch`.
    - If no error is expected, it checks if the returned hash and body match the expected values.

## Dependencies
This test file has dependencies on the following external libraries:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `context` | Used for managing the context of the HTTP requests. |
| `errors` | Used for creating and comparing errors. |
| `io` | Used for writing to the HTTP response writer. |
| `net/http` | Used for creating a test HTTP server and handling HTTP requests and responses. |
| `net/http/httptest` | Used for creating a test HTTP server. |
| `testing` | Used for writing and running tests. |
| `github.com/stretchr/testify/assert` | Used for making assertions in the tests. |
| `go.flipt.io/flipt/internal/server/authz/engine/rego/source` | Used for accessing the `source.Hash` type and `source.ErrNotModified` error. |

## Error Handling
The tests cover error handling by simulating error responses from the server and verifying that the `fetch` function returns the expected errors. For example, it checks for a `source.ErrNotModified` error when the server returns a `http.StatusNotModified` status code and a custom error message when the server returns a `http.StatusNotFound` status code.
