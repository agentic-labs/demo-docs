## High-level description
This code defines two data source types, `LocalPolicySource` and `LocalDataSource`, both of which read data from the local filesystem. `LocalPolicySource` reads raw bytes from a file, while `LocalDataSource` reads a file and parses it as a JSON object.

## Code Structure
Both `LocalPolicySource` and `LocalDataSource` are structs that hold a file path. They implement the `source.PolicySource` and `source.DataSource` interfaces, respectively, by providing a `Get` method. The `read` function is a helper function used by both `Get` methods to read data from the filesystem.

## Symbols

### `PolicySourceFromPath`
#### Description
This function is a constructor for `LocalPolicySource`. It takes a file path as input and returns a new `LocalPolicySource` instance pointing to that path.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| path | string | The path to the policy file. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| *LocalPolicySource | *LocalPolicySource | A pointer to the new `LocalPolicySource` instance. |

### `LocalPolicySource`
#### Description
This struct represents a policy source that reads policy data from a local file.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| path | string | The path to the policy file. |

### `LocalPolicySource.Get`
#### Description
This method reads the policy data from the file specified by the `path` field. It checks the modification time of the file against a provided hash (`seen`) to determine if the content has changed. If the content has not changed, it returns `source.ErrNotModified`. Otherwise, it reads the file content and returns it as a byte slice along with the new modification time hash.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ctx | context.Context | The context for the request. |
| seen | source.Hash | The previously seen modification time hash of the file. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| []byte | []byte | The policy data read from the file. |
| source.Hash | source.Hash | The new modification time hash of the file. |
| error | error | An error, if any occurred during the process. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Get the file information using `os.Stat`.
2. Calculate the modification time hash of the file.
3. Compare the calculated hash with the `seen` hash. If they are equal, return `source.ErrNotModified`.
4. Read the file content using `os.ReadFile`.
5. Return the file content and the new modification time hash.

### `DataSourceFromPath`
#### Description
This function is a constructor for `LocalDataSource`. It takes a file path as input and returns a new `LocalDataSource` instance pointing to that path.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| path | string | The path to the data file. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| *LocalDataSource | *LocalDataSource | A pointer to the new `LocalDataSource` instance. |

### `LocalDataSource`
#### Description
This struct represents a data source that reads data from a local file and parses it as JSON.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| path | string | The path to the data file. |

### `LocalDataSource.Get`
#### Description
This method reads the data from the file specified by the `path` field and parses it as a JSON object. It checks the modification time of the file against a provided hash (`seen`) to determine if the content has changed. If the content has not changed, it returns `source.ErrNotModified`. Otherwise, it reads the file content, unmarshals it into a `map[string]any` and returns it along with the new modification time hash.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ctx | context.Context | The context for the request. |
| seen | source.Hash | The previously seen modification time hash of the file. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| map[string]any | map[string]any | The data read from the file, parsed as a JSON object. |
| source.Hash | source.Hash | The new modification time hash of the file. |
| error | error | An error, if any occurred during the process. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Read the file content and modification time hash using the `read` function.
2. Unmarshal the file content into a `map[string]any` using `json.Unmarshal`.
3. Return the parsed data and the new modification time hash.

### `read`
#### Description
This function is a helper function that reads the content of a file and calculates its modification time hash.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| path | string | The path to the file. |
| seen | []byte | The previously seen modification time hash of the file. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| data | []byte | The content of the file. |
| mod | []byte | The modification time hash of the file. |
| err | error | An error, if any occurred during the process. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Get the file information using `os.Stat`.
2. Calculate the modification time hash of the file.
3. Compare the calculated hash with the `seen` hash. If they are equal, return `source.ErrNotModified`.
4. Read the file content using `os.ReadFile`.
5. Return the file content and the new modification time hash.
