## High-level description
The `cloud.go` file defines data structures and functions for fetching authorization policies and data from a remote Flipt cloud instance. It implements the `source.PolicySource` and `source.DataSource` interfaces, allowing the Rego authorization engine to retrieve and update policies and data from the cloud.

## Code Structure
The code defines two main structs: `CloudPolicySource` and `CloudDataSource`, both of which implement the `Get` method from the `source` package's interfaces. The `fetch` function is a helper used by both structs to make HTTP requests to the Flipt cloud API.

## References
- `source.Hash`: Represents a hash value used for caching and change detection.
- `source.ErrNotModified`: An error indicating that the requested resource has not been modified since the provided hash.

## Symbols

### `CloudPolicySource`
#### Description
This struct represents a source for authorization policies fetched from a Flipt cloud instance.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a struct definition.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a struct definition.

### `PolicySourceFromCloud`
#### Description
This function creates a new `CloudPolicySource` instance.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| host | string | The host address of the Flipt cloud instance. |
| apiKey | string | The API key for authenticating with the Flipt cloud instance. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| *CloudPolicySource | *CloudPolicySource | A pointer to the newly created `CloudPolicySource` instance. |

#### Internal Logic
The function simply initializes a new `CloudPolicySource` struct with the provided host and API key.

### `(*CloudPolicySource) Get`
#### Description
This method fetches the authorization policy from the Flipt cloud instance.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ctx | context.Context | The context for the request. |
| seen | source.Hash | The hash of the previously fetched policy, used for caching. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| []byte | []byte | The fetched policy as a byte slice. |
| source.Hash | source.Hash | The hash of the fetched policy. |
| error | error | An error, if any occurred during the fetch process. |

#### Internal Logic
The method constructs the API endpoint URL and calls the `fetch` function to retrieve the policy. If the request is successful, it returns the policy and its ETag as the hash. If the server returns a "304 Not Modified" status, it returns `source.ErrNotModified`.

### `CloudDataSource`
#### Description
This struct represents a source for authorization data fetched from a Flipt cloud instance.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a struct definition.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a struct definition.

### `DataSourceFromCloud`
#### Description
This function creates a new `CloudDataSource` instance.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| host | string | The host address of the Flipt cloud instance. |
| apiKey | string | The API key for authenticating with the Flipt cloud instance. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| *CloudDataSource | *CloudDataSource | A pointer to the newly created `CloudDataSource` instance. |

#### Internal Logic
The function simply initializes a new `CloudDataSource` struct with the provided host and API key.

### `(*CloudDataSource) Get`
#### Description
This method fetches the authorization data from the Flipt cloud instance.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ctx | context.Context | The context for the request. |
| seen | source.Hash | The hash of the previously fetched data, used for caching. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| map[string]any | map[string]any | The fetched data as a map. |
| source.Hash | source.Hash | The hash of the fetched data. |
| error | error | An error, if any occurred during the fetch process. |

#### Internal Logic
The method constructs the API endpoint URL and calls the `fetch` function to retrieve the data. If the request is successful, it unmarshals the JSON response into a map and returns it along with the ETag as the hash. If the server returns a "304 Not Modified" status, it returns `source.ErrNotModified`.

### `fetch`
#### Description
This function makes an HTTP GET request to the specified URL with the provided API key and optional If-None-Match header.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ctx | context.Context | The context for the request. |
| seen | source.Hash | The hash used for the If-None-Match header. |
| url | string | The URL to make the request to. |
| apiKey | string | The API key for authentication. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| []byte | []byte | The response body as a byte slice. |
| source.Hash | source.Hash | The ETag header value as a byte slice. |
| error | error | An error, if any occurred during the request. |

#### Internal Logic
The function creates a new HTTP request with the provided context, URL, and headers. It then sends the request using an HTTP client with a 30-second timeout. If the response status code is 200 (OK), it reads and returns the response body and ETag header. If the status code is 304 (Not Modified), it returns `source.ErrNotModified`. Any other status code or error during the process results in an error being returned.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| context | Provides a way to pass request-scoped values and cancellation signals. |
| encoding/json | Used for unmarshalling JSON responses. |
| fmt | Used for string formatting and error wrapping. |
| io | Used for reading the response body. |
| net/http | Used for making HTTP requests. |
| time | Used for setting the HTTP client timeout. |
| go.flipt.io/flipt/internal/server/authz/engine/rego/source | Provides the `Hash` type and `ErrNotModified` error. |

## Error Handling
The code uses the `error` interface for error handling. Errors are wrapped using `fmt.Errorf` to provide more context. The `source.ErrNotModified` error is specifically handled to indicate that the requested resource has not changed.

## Logging
This code does not implement any logging.
