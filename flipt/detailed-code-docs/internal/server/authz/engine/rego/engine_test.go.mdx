## High-level description
The `engine_test.go` file contains unit tests for the Rego authorization engine used in the Flipt server. It tests the engine's ability to load policy and data, evaluate authorization requests, and handle different user roles and permissions.

## Code Structure
This file contains a series of test functions, each testing a specific aspect of the Rego authorization engine. The tests use the `require` package for assertions and simulate different authorization scenarios with predefined input data.

## References
- `go.flipt.io/flipt/internal/server/authz/engine/rego/source`: This package provides interfaces for fetching policy and data used by the Rego engine.

### `TestEngine_NewEngine`
#### Description
This test function verifies that a new Rego authorization engine can be successfully created with policy and data sources.

#### Inputs
This function does not take any specific inputs. It uses predefined policy and data files located in the `testdata` directory.

#### Outputs
This function does not return any outputs. It uses the `require` package to assert that the engine creation process is successful.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Arrange:** Reads the Rego policy and data from files in the `testdata` directory.
2. **Act:** Creates a new Rego engine using the `newEngine` function, providing the policy and data as sources.
3. **Assert:** Asserts that the engine creation was successful and that the engine instance is not nil.

### `TestEngine_IsAllowed`
#### Description
This test function verifies the authorization decisions made by the Rego engine for different user roles and actions.

#### Inputs
This function does not take any specific inputs. It uses a table of test cases, each containing:
- `name`: The name of the test case.
- `input`: A JSON string representing the authorization request, including user authentication details and the requested action and resource.
- `expected`: A boolean value indicating whether the request is expected to be allowed or denied.

#### Outputs
This function does not return any outputs. It uses the `require` package to assert that the engine's authorization decision matches the expected value for each test case.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Arrange:** Iterates through a table of test cases, each defining a specific authorization scenario.
2. **Act:** For each test case:
    - Reads the Rego policy and data from files in the `testdata` directory.
    - Creates a new Rego engine using the `newEngine` function.
    - Unmarshals the JSON input string into a map representing the authorization request.
    - Calls the `IsAllowed` function of the engine with the request data.
3. **Assert:** Asserts that the engine's authorization decision (allowed or denied) matches the expected value defined in the test case.

### `policySource`
#### Description
This type defines a custom policy source that returns a static Rego policy from a string.

#### Inputs
- `context.Context`: The context for the request.
- `source.Hash`: The hash of the previous policy, used for caching.

#### Outputs
- `[]byte`: The Rego policy as a byte slice.
- `source.Hash`: A nil hash, as the policy is static.
- `error`: An error if any occurred, nil otherwise.

### `dataSource`
#### Description
This type defines a custom data source that returns static data from a JSON string.

#### Inputs
- `context.Context`: The context for the request.
- `source.Hash`: The hash of the previous data, used for caching.

#### Outputs
- `map[string]any`: The data as a map.
- `source.Hash`: A nil hash, as the data is static.
- `error`: An error if any occurred during JSON unmarshalling, nil otherwise.
