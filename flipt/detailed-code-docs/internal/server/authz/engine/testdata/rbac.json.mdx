title: "rbac.json"

## High-level description
This JSON file defines Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) rules for different user roles. It specifies which resources each role can access and what actions they are permitted to perform on those resources.

## Code Structure
This JSON file represents a single dictionary with two keys: "version" and "roles". The "version" key maps to a string representing the version of the RBAC definition. The "roles" key maps to a list of dictionaries, with each dictionary representing a single role. Each role dictionary contains a "name" key mapping to the role's name and a "rules" key mapping to a list of rule dictionaries. Each rule dictionary defines the resource, allowed actions, and optional namespace constraint for that role.

## Symbols
### `rbac.json`
#### Description
This JSON file defines the access control rules for different user roles in the system. It maps roles to a set of rules that determine their permissions on various resources.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a data file, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a data file, not a function.

#### Internal Logic
The file defines a list of roles, each with a name and a set of rules. Each rule specifies:
- **resource**: The resource the rule applies to (e.g., "namespace", "flag"). A "*" wildcard indicates all resources.
- **actions**: Allowed actions on the resource (e.g., "read", "create", "update", "delete"). A "*" wildcard indicates all actions.
- **namespace** (optional): Limits the rule's scope to a specific namespace.

**Example:**
The "editor" role has rules allowing them to "read" namespaces and authentication, and "create", "read", "update", and "delete" flags and segments.

## Configuration
This file acts as a configuration file for RBAC rules. The structure and content of this JSON data define the access control policy enforced within the system.
