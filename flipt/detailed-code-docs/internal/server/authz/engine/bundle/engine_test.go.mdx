## High-level description
The `engine_test.go` file contains unit tests for the `Engine` struct within the Flipt authorization engine. These tests specifically target the `IsAllowed` method, which determines if a given request is authorized based on a predefined RBAC policy and data. The tests cover various scenarios with different user roles and permissions.

## References
- `github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/sdk`: This package is used for interacting with the Open Policy Agent (OPA) engine.
- `github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/sdk/test`: This package provides utilities for testing OPA integrations.
- `github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/storage/inmem`: This package provides an in-memory storage implementation for OPA.

## Symbols
### `TestEngine_IsAllowed`
#### Description
This function is a unit test for the `IsAllowed` method of the `Engine` struct. It sets up an OPA instance with a predefined RBAC policy and data, then runs a series of test cases to verify that the `IsAllowed` method correctly determines authorization for different request scenarios.

#### Inputs
This function takes no explicit inputs. It uses the `testing.T` object from the testing framework.

#### Outputs
This function has no explicit outputs. It uses the `testing.T` object to report test results.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Arrange:**
    - Reads the RBAC policy from `../testdata/rbac.rego`.
    - Reads the RBAC data from `../testdata/rbac.json`.
    - Starts a mock OPA server and configures it with the policy and data.
    - Creates a new `Engine` instance with the configured OPA instance.
    - Defines a set of test cases, each with a name, input request JSON, and expected authorization result.
2. **Act:**
    - Iterates through each test case.
    - Unmarshals the input JSON into a map.
    - Calls the `IsAllowed` method of the `Engine` with the input map.
3. **Assert:**
    - Verifies that the `IsAllowed` method returns the expected authorization result for each test case.
    - Shuts down the OPA server and cleans up resources.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/sdk | Used to interact with the Open Policy Agent (OPA) engine. |
| github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/sdk/test | Provides utilities for testing OPA integrations. |
| github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/storage/inmem | Provides an in-memory storage implementation for OPA. |
| github.com/stretchr/testify/assert | Provides assertion functions for testing. |
| github.com/stretchr/testify/require | Provides assertion functions that stop test execution on failure. |
| go.uber.org/zap/zaptest | Provides a testing logger implementation. |

## Error Handling
The test cases use the `require.NoError` function to check for errors during policy and data loading, OPA server setup, JSON unmarshalling, and `IsAllowed` method execution. Any error encountered will cause the test to fail immediately.
