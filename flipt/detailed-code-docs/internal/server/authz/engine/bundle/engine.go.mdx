## High-level description
The `engine.go` file implements an authorization engine using Open Policy Agent (OPA) for Flipt. It provides a way to verify if a given request is allowed based on the configured authorization policies.

## Code Structure
The `Engine` struct holds an instance of the OPA engine and implements the `authz.Verifier` interface. The `NewEngine` function initializes the OPA engine with the provided configuration and returns a new instance of the `Engine`. The `IsAllowed` method evaluates the authorization policy against the provided input and returns whether the request is allowed or not. The `Shutdown` method gracefully stops the OPA engine.

## Symbols

### `Engine`
#### Description
The `Engine` struct represents the authorization engine that uses OPA to evaluate authorization policies.

#### Inputs
This struct does not have explicit inputs.

#### Outputs
This struct does not have explicit outputs.

### `NewEngine`
#### Description
The `NewEngine` function initializes a new instance of the `Engine` struct. It reads the authorization configuration and creates an OPA instance with the specified configuration.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ctx | context.Context | The context for the operation. |
| logger | *zap.Logger | The logger instance. |
| cfg | *config.Config | The Flipt configuration. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Engine | *Engine | A pointer to the initialized `Engine` instance. |
| error | error | An error if the initialization fails. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Reads the authorization configuration from the provided `config.Config`.
2. Sets the `AWS_REGION` environment variable if it's not set and the region is specified in the S3 object authorization backend configuration.
3. Creates a new OPA instance with the specified configuration, using an in-memory store and the provided logger.
4. Returns a new `Engine` instance with the initialized OPA instance and cleanup functions.

### `(e *Engine) IsAllowed`
#### Description
The `IsAllowed` method determines if a request is allowed based on the provided input and the loaded OPA policy.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ctx | context.Context | The context for the operation. |
| input | map[string]interface{} | The input data for the authorization policy evaluation. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| bool | bool | True if the request is allowed, false otherwise. |
| error | error | An error if the policy evaluation fails. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Logs the input data for debugging purposes.
2. Calls the OPA engine to evaluate the policy at the path "flipt/authz/v1/allow" with the provided input.
3. If the evaluation is successful, extracts the result as a boolean value.
4. Returns the boolean result indicating whether the request is allowed.

### `(e *Engine) Shutdown`
#### Description
The `Shutdown` method gracefully shuts down the OPA engine and performs any necessary cleanup.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ctx | context.Context | The context for the operation. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| error | error | An error if the shutdown process fails. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls the `Stop` method on the OPA instance to gracefully shut it down.
2. Iterates through the registered cleanup functions and executes them.

## Dependencies

## Error Handling
The `IsAllowed` method returns an error if the OPA policy evaluation fails. The `NewEngine` function returns an error if the OPA initialization fails or if there is an error reading the authorization configuration. The `Shutdown` method returns an error if any of the cleanup functions fail.
