## High-level description
The code defines an `authz` package with a `Verifier` interface for authorization purposes. This interface provides a way to check if an action is allowed in a given context and allows for graceful shutdown.

## Code Structure
The `Verifier` interface is the core component, defining two methods: `IsAllowed` for authorization checks and `Shutdown` for resource cleanup.

## Symbols

### Symbol Name
`Verifier`

#### Description
The `Verifier` interface defines the contract for authorization logic. Implementations of this interface are responsible for determining if an action is allowed based on the provided context and input.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is an interface definition.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is an interface definition.

#### Internal Logic
This is an interface definition and does not contain internal logic.

### Symbol Name
`IsAllowed`

#### Description
The `IsAllowed` method checks if an action is allowed within the given context.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ctx | context.Context | The context of the request. |
| input | map[string]any | A map containing arbitrary input data for the authorization check. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| bool |  | True if the action is allowed, false otherwise. |
| error | error | An error if the authorization check failed. |

#### Internal Logic
The internal logic of this method is implementation-specific and depends on the concrete implementation of the `Verifier` interface.

### Symbol Name
`Shutdown`

#### Description
The `Shutdown` method provides a way to gracefully shut down the `Verifier` instance, releasing any held resources.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ctx | context.Context | The context of the shutdown request. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| error | error | An error if the shutdown process encountered any issues. |

#### Internal Logic
The internal logic of this method is implementation-specific and depends on the resource management needs of the concrete `Verifier` implementation.
