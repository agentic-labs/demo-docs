## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for the `AuthorizationRequiredInterceptor` function, which is a gRPC middleware responsible for enforcing authorization policies on incoming requests. The tests cover various scenarios, including successful authorization, authorization failures, skipped authorization, and error handling.

## Code Structure
The code defines a `mockPolicyVerifier` struct that implements the `authz.Verifier` interface, allowing for controlled testing of authorization decisions. It also defines a `mockServer` struct that implements the `SkipsAuthorization` method, enabling tests for scenarios where authorization should be bypassed. The `TestAuthorizationRequiredInterceptor` function then uses these mocks to test the `AuthorizationRequiredInterceptor` function under different conditions.

## Symbols
### `TestAuthorizationRequiredInterceptor`
#### Description
This function is a table-driven unit test that verifies the behavior of the `AuthorizationRequiredInterceptor` function. It iterates through a set of test cases, each defining a specific scenario with different inputs and expected outcomes.

#### Inputs
This test function does not take any explicit inputs. It is parameterized by a table of test cases.

#### Outputs
This test function does not return any explicit outputs. It uses the `assert` and `require` packages to verify the expected behavior of the `AuthorizationRequiredInterceptor` function.

#### Internal Logic
The test function iterates through a table of test cases, each containing:
- `name`: The name of the test case.
- `server`: An optional `mockServer` instance to control authorization skipping.
- `req`: The gRPC request object.
- `authn`: The authentication context for the request.
- `validatorAllowed`: The expected authorization decision from the mock policy verifier.
- `validatorErr`: An optional error to be returned by the mock policy verifier.
- `wantAllowed`: Whether the request is expected to be allowed.
- `authzInput`: The expected input passed to the policy verifier.

For each test case, the function:
1. **Arranges** the test by creating a new logger, a mock policy verifier, and a gRPC unary handler.
2. **Acts** by invoking the `AuthorizationRequiredInterceptor` function with the test case's inputs.
3. **Asserts** that the actual outcome matches the expected outcome defined in the test case. This includes verifying whether the request was allowed, whether any errors occurred, and whether the correct input was passed to the policy verifier.

## Side Effects
This code has no side effects as it is a test function and does not modify any external state.
