## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of a gRPC middleware for authorization in the Flipt project. The main component is the `AuthorizationRequiredInterceptor`, which enforces authorization policies on incoming gRPC requests. The directory includes the main implementation file and a corresponding test file.

## What does it do?
The gRPC middleware in this directory performs the following tasks:

1. Intercepts incoming gRPC requests.
2. Determines whether authorization should be skipped for certain requests or servers.
3. Retrieves authentication information from the request context.
4. Verifies if the requester is allowed to perform the requested action using a policy verifier.
5. Allows the request to proceed if authorized or returns an unauthorized error if not.

This middleware ensures that only authorized requests are processed by the gRPC server, adding a layer of security to the Flipt application.

## Key Files

### middleware.go
This file contains the main implementation of the `AuthorizationRequiredInterceptor`. It defines the interceptor function, along with supporting types and functions for configuration and authorization checks.

Key components include:
- `AuthorizationRequiredInterceptor`: The main gRPC interceptor function.
- `InterceptorOptions`: Configuration options for the interceptor.
- `SkipsAuthorizationServer`: An interface for servers that can skip authorization.
- `skipped`: A function to determine if authorization should be skipped.
- `WithServerSkipsAuthorization`: A function to configure authorization skipping for specific servers.

### middleware_test.go
This file contains unit tests for the `AuthorizationRequiredInterceptor`. It uses table-driven tests to verify the behavior of the interceptor under various scenarios, including:
- Successful authorization
- Authorization failures
- Skipped authorization
- Error handling

The tests use mock implementations of the policy verifier and server to control the test scenarios.

## Dependencies
The code relies on several internal and external dependencies:

1. `go.uber.org/zap`: For logging (version not specified in the provided code).
2. `google.golang.org/grpc`: For gRPC functionality (version not specified).
3. `go.flipt.io/flipt/errors`: For defining and handling authorization errors.
4. `go.flipt.io/flipt/internal/containers`: For options pattern in configuration.
5. `go.flipt.io/flipt/internal/server/authn/middleware/grpc`: For retrieving authentication information.
6. `go.flipt.io/flipt/internal/server/authz`: For the `Verifier` interface used in policy verification.
7. `go.flipt.io/flipt/rpc/flipt`: For the `Requester` interface and request structures.

These dependencies were likely chosen to integrate seamlessly with the existing Flipt architecture and to leverage well-established libraries for logging and gRPC functionality.

## Configuration
The `AuthorizationRequiredInterceptor` can be configured using the `InterceptorOptions` struct and the `WithServerSkipsAuthorization` function. This allows for fine-tuning of authorization behavior, such as specifying servers that should skip authorization checks.

Configuration options include:
- `skippedServers`: A list of server instances for which authorization should be skipped.

Example usage:
```go
interceptor := AuthorizationRequiredInterceptor(
    logger,
    policyVerifier,
    WithServerSkipsAuthorization(someServer),
)
```

The interceptor also respects the `SkipsAuthorizationServer` interface, allowing servers to dynamically indicate whether authorization should be skipped for a given context.

In summary, this directory provides a flexible and configurable gRPC middleware for enforcing authorization policies in the Flipt project, with comprehensive test coverage to ensure its reliability and correctness.
