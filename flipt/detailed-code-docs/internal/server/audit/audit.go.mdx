## High-level description
The `audit.go` file defines the audit logging mechanism for the Flipt server. It introduces a `Sink` interface for sending audit events to various destinations and a `SinkSpanExporter` that implements OpenTelemetry's `SpanExporter` interface to intercept and process span events, converting them into audit events and sending them to configured sinks.

## Code Structure
The `SinkSpanExporter` uses the `Sink` interface to send audit events. The `Event` struct defines the structure of an audit event. The `decodeToEvent` function converts OpenTelemetry span events to `Event` objects.

## References
- `sdktrace.ReadOnlySpan`: Used to access span events and attributes.
- `Event`: Represents an audit event.
- `Sink`: Interface for audit event destinations.

## Symbols

### `Sink`
#### Description
The `Sink` interface defines the contract for different audit log destinations. It requires implementations to have a `SendAudits` method for sending a batch of events and a `Close` method for closing the sink.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is an interface definition.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is an interface definition.

### `SinkSpanExporter`
#### Description
`SinkSpanExporter` implements OpenTelemetry's `SpanExporter` interface to capture span events, decode them into audit events, and send them to configured sinks.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a struct definition.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a struct definition.

### `NewSinkSpanExporter`
#### Description
`NewSinkSpanExporter` is the constructor function for `SinkSpanExporter`. It takes a logger and a list of `Sink` implementations as arguments and returns a new `SinkSpanExporter` instance.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| logger | `*zap.Logger` | Logger instance for recording events. |
| sinks | `[]Sink` | List of sinks to send audit events to. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| EventExporter | `EventExporter` | An instance of `SinkSpanExporter` implementing the `EventExporter` interface. |

### `ExportSpans`
#### Description
`ExportSpans` is part of the `SpanExporter` interface implementation. It iterates through the provided spans and their events, attempts to decode each event into an `Event` object, and sends the collected events to the configured sinks.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ctx | `context.Context` | Context for the operation. |
| spans | `[]sdktrace.ReadOnlySpan` | List of spans to export. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| error | `error` | An error if any operation fails during the export process. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Iterates through each span in the provided list.
2. For each span, iterates through its events.
3. Attempts to decode each event into an `Event` object using `decodeToEvent`.
4. Appends successfully decoded events to a slice.
5. Calls `SendAudits` to send the collected events to the configured sinks.

### `Shutdown`
#### Description
`Shutdown` is part of the `SpanExporter` interface implementation. It closes all registered sinks.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ctx | `context.Context` | Context for the operation. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| error | `error` | An error if any sink fails to close. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Iterates through each registered sink.
2. Calls the `Close` method on each sink.
3. Collects and returns any errors encountered during the process.

### `SendAudits`
#### Description
`SendAudits` sends a batch of audit events to all configured sinks.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ctx | `context.Context` | Context for the operation. |
| es | `[]Event` | List of audit events to send. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| error | `error` | An error if any sink fails to send the events. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if there are any events to send.
2. Iterates through each configured sink.
3. Calls the `SendAudits` method on each sink with the provided events.
4. Logs any errors encountered during the process.

## Dependencies
- `context`
- `errors`
- `fmt`
- `io`
- `github.com/hashicorp/go-multierror`
- `sdktrace "go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/trace"`
- `go.uber.org/zap`

## Error Handling
The code uses `error` values to indicate failures in various operations. It also leverages the `github.com/hashicorp/go-multierror` library to aggregate and return multiple errors.

## Logging
The code uses a `*zap.Logger` instance to log debug and error messages during the audit event processing and sending.
