## High-level description
The `events.go` file defines the structure and functionality for audit events within the Flipt system. It provides a mechanism to record, decode, and manage information about actions performed within the application.

## Code Structure
The code defines the `Event` struct, which represents an audit event, and several functions that operate on it. The `NewEvent` function creates a new `Event` instance, while `DecodeToAttributes` converts an `Event` into a format suitable for OpenTelemetry tracing. Other functions handle tasks like adding events to spans, validating events, and marshalling them for logging.

## References
This code references the `flipt.Request` and `flipt.Action` types from the `go.flipt.io/flipt/rpc/flipt` package, indicating its role in processing requests within the Flipt system.

## Symbols

### `Event`
#### Description
The `Event` struct represents an audit event, capturing details about an action performed within the Flipt system.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a struct definition, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a struct definition, not a function.

#### Internal Logic
The `Event` struct contains fields for storing information such as the event version, type, action, metadata, payload, timestamp, and status.

### `NewEvent`
#### Description
The `NewEvent` function creates a new `Event` instance populated with details from a `flipt.Request` and associated metadata.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| r | `flipt.Request` | The Flipt request that triggered the event. |
| actor | `*Actor` | Information about the actor who initiated the request. |
| payload | `interface{}` | The payload associated with the event. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `*Event` | `*Event` | A pointer to the newly created `Event` instance. |

#### Internal Logic
The function determines the action type based on the `flipt.Request.Action` field. It sets the event type based on the request's resource or subject. It then populates the `Event` struct with the provided information and a timestamp.

### `DecodeToAttributes`
#### Description
The `DecodeToAttributes` method converts an `Event` instance into a slice of `attribute.KeyValue`, suitable for use with OpenTelemetry tracing.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a method of the `Event` struct.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `[]attribute.KeyValue` | `[]attribute.KeyValue` | A slice of key-value pairs representing the event attributes. |

#### Internal Logic
The method iterates through the fields of the `Event` struct and converts them into `attribute.KeyValue` pairs. It handles JSON marshalling for complex fields like `Metadata.Actor` and `Payload`.

### `AddToSpan`
#### Description
The `AddToSpan` method adds an `Event` to an OpenTelemetry trace span.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ctx | `context.Context` | The context containing the OpenTelemetry trace span. |

#### Outputs
N/A

#### Internal Logic
The method retrieves the span from the context and adds an event with attributes derived from the `Event` instance using `DecodeToAttributes`.

### `Valid`
#### Description
The `Valid` method checks if an `Event` instance is valid by ensuring required fields are populated.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a method of the `Event` struct.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `bool` | `bool` | True if the event is valid, false otherwise. |

#### Internal Logic
The method checks if the `Version`, `Action`, `Type`, and `Timestamp` fields of the `Event` are non-empty.

### `MarshalLogObject`
#### Description
The `MarshalLogObject` method encodes an `Event` instance into a Zap logger's object encoder.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| enc | `zapcore.ObjectEncoder` | The Zap object encoder to encode the event into. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `error` | `error` | An error if encoding fails, nil otherwise. |

#### Internal Logic
The method adds the fields of the `Event` struct to the provided `zapcore.ObjectEncoder`. It handles errors during reflection for complex fields like `Metadata` and `Payload`.

### `CopyInto`
#### Description
The `CopyInto` method copies the contents of one `Event` instance into another.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| out | `*Event` | A pointer to the `Event` instance to copy the data into. |

#### Outputs
N/A

#### Internal Logic
The method performs a deep copy of the `Event` instance, including the `Metadata` and `Payload` fields.

### `PayloadToMap`
#### Description
The `PayloadToMap` method attempts to convert the event's payload into a `map[string]any`.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a method of the `Event` struct.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `map[string]any, error` | `map[string]any, error` | A map representing the payload, or an error if conversion fails. |

#### Internal Logic
The method first checks if the payload is nil. If not, it marshals the payload to JSON, then unmarshals it into a `map[string]any`.

### `decodeToEvent`
#### Description
The `decodeToEvent` function decodes a slice of `attribute.KeyValue` into an `Event` instance.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| kvs | `[]attribute.KeyValue` | A slice of key-value pairs representing event attributes. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `*Event, error` | `*Event, error` | A pointer to the decoded `Event` instance, or an error if decoding fails. |

#### Internal Logic
The function iterates through the provided key-value pairs and populates the corresponding fields of a new `Event` instance. It handles JSON unmarshalling for complex fields like `Metadata.Actor` and `Payload`. It also validates the decoded event using the `Valid` method.

### `Actor`
#### Description
The `Actor` struct represents information about the entity that initiated an action, such as authentication method, IP address, email, name, and profile picture.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a struct definition, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a struct definition, not a function.

#### Internal Logic
The `Actor` struct contains fields for storing information about the actor.

### `Metadata`
#### Description
The `Metadata` struct holds additional information about an event, currently just the `Actor`.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a struct definition, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a struct definition, not a function.

#### Internal Logic
The `Metadata` struct contains a pointer to an `Actor` instance.

## Error Handling
The code uses basic error handling with the `error` type. Functions return errors for situations like JSON marshalling/unmarshalling failures or when a decoded event is invalid.

## Logging
The code does not directly implement logging but provides a `MarshalLogObject` method to facilitate logging events using the Zap logger.
