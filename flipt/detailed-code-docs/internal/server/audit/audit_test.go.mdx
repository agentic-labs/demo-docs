## High-level description
The code in `audit_test.go` defines a test suite for the `SinkSpanExporter` in the Flipt audit package. It simulates different scenarios of audit events being generated from OpenTelemetry spans and verifies that the events are correctly sent to the configured audit sinks.

## Symbols

### `TestSinkSpanExporter`
#### Description
This function is a table-driven test that checks the behavior of the `SinkSpanExporter` under various conditions. It creates a sample sink, a span exporter, and a tracer. It then simulates a span with an audit event and asserts that the event is received by the sink.

#### Inputs
This is a test function and does not take any inputs.

#### Outputs
This is a test function and does not return any outputs.

#### Internal Logic
The test iterates through a set of test cases, each defining a different combination of resource, subject, and action for an audit event. 
1. **Arrange:** For each case, it sets up a context, a sample sink, a `SinkSpanExporter` with the sample sink, and an OpenTelemetry tracer with the exporter.
2. **Act:** It then starts a span, creates an audit event with the specified parameters, adds the event to the span, and ends the span.
3. **Assert:** Finally, it waits for the sample sink to receive the event and asserts that the received event matches the created event. If the test case expects an error, it ensures that the sink does not receive the event.

- `flipt.Subject`: Represents the entity performing the action in an audit event.
- `flipt.Action`: Represents the type of action performed in an audit event.
- `Event`: Represents an audit event containing metadata and version information.
- `Actor`: Represents the actor performing the action in an audit event, including authentication and IP address.
- `Flag`: Represents a feature flag in the Flipt system.
- `NewSinkSpanExporter`: Creates a new instance of the `SinkSpanExporter`.
- `NewEvent`: Creates a new audit event.
- `sdktrace.NewTracerProvider`: Creates a new OpenTelemetry tracer provider.
- `sdktrace.WithSampler`: Configures the sampling behavior of the tracer.
- `sdktrace.AlwaysSample`: A sampler that samples every trace.
- `sdktrace.NewSimpleSpanProcessor`: Creates a new span processor that exports spans to the configured exporter.

## Dependencies
- `github.com/stretchr/testify/assert`: Used for making assertions in the test cases.
- `go.flipt.io/flipt/rpc/flipt`: Provides Flipt-specific data structures and constants.
- `go.uber.org/zap`: Provides logging functionality.
- `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/trace`: Provides OpenTelemetry tracing functionality.
- `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/trace`: Provides OpenTelemetry trace primitives.

## Error Handling
The test cases explicitly check for expected errors by setting the `expectErr` flag. If an error is expected, the test asserts that the sink does not receive the event.

## Logging
The test uses a `zap.NewNop()` logger, which discards all log messages. This is suitable for testing as it avoids cluttering the test output with log messages.
