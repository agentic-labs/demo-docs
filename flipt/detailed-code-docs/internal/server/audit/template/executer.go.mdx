## High-level description
The `executer.go` file defines the `webhookTemplate` struct and its methods, which are responsible for sending audit events to a configured webhook URL. It uses a `retryablehttp.Client` to handle retries with exponential backoff in case of network errors.

## Code Structure
The `webhookTemplate` struct holds the configuration for the webhook, including the URL, headers, and a template for the request body. The `Execute` method uses this configuration to construct and send an HTTP POST request containing the audit event data.

## Symbols

### `funcMap`
#### Description
`funcMap` is a variable of type `template.FuncMap` that defines a custom template function `toJson`. This function is used within the webhook body template to marshal data into JSON format.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a variable, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a variable, not a function.

#### Internal Logic
The `toJson` function takes an interface{} as input and uses `json.Marshal` to convert it into a JSON byte array. If successful, it returns the JSON data as a string; otherwise, it returns an error.

### `webhookTemplate`
#### Description
The `webhookTemplate` struct represents a webhook configuration for sending audit events. It stores the target URL, HTTP headers, a template for the request body, and a `retryablehttp.Client` for handling retries.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a struct, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a struct, not a function.

### `Executer`
#### Description
The `Executer` interface defines a contract for types that can execute an action based on an audit event. It has a single method, `Execute`, which takes a context and an `audit.Event` as input and returns an error.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is an interface, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is an interface, not a function.

### `NewWebhookTemplate`
#### Description
The `NewWebhookTemplate` function is a constructor for the `webhookTemplate` struct. It takes a logger, URL, body template string, headers map, and maximum backoff duration as input. It parses the body template and creates a new `retryablehttp.Client` with a configured logger and retry policy.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| logger | *zap.Logger | A logger instance for recording events. |
| url | string | The target webhook URL. |
| body | string | The template string for the request body. |
| headers | map[string]string | A map of HTTP headers to include in the request. |
| maxBackoffDuration | time.Duration | The maximum backoff duration for retries. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Executer | `Executer` | An `Executer` instance configured with the provided parameters. |
| error | error | An error if the template parsing or client creation fails. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Parses the provided `body` string as a Go template using the `funcMap`.
2. Creates a new `retryablehttp.Client` and configures its logger and `RetryWaitMax` using the provided `logger` and `maxBackoffDuration`.
3. Returns a new `webhookTemplate` instance with the parsed template, URL, headers, and configured HTTP client.

### `(*webhookTemplate).Execute`
#### Description
The `Execute` method implements the `Executer` interface for `webhookTemplate`. It takes a context and an `audit.Event` as input. It executes the body template with the event data, constructs an HTTP POST request with the configured URL and headers, and sends the request using the `retryablehttp.Client`.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ctx | context.Context | The context for the request. |
| event | `audit.Event` | The audit event data to send. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| error | error | An error if the template execution, request creation, or sending fails. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes the `bodyTemplate` with the provided `event` data and writes the output to a buffer.
2. Checks if the buffered data is valid JSON.
3. Creates a new HTTP POST request with the configured `url`, buffered data as the body, and configured `headers`.
4. Adds the `Content-Type: application/json` header if it's not already present.
5. Sends the request using the `httpClient` (which handles retries).
6. Closes the response body if the request is successful.
7. Returns an error if any step fails.
