## High-level description
The `template` package provides an audit sink implementation, `Sink`, that executes a list of `Executer` instances for each audit event received. This allows for custom audit event handling, such as logging or sending events to an external system.

## Code Structure
The `Sink` struct holds a logger and a list of `Executer` instances. The `SendAudits` method iterates through the provided audit events and calls the `Execute` method of each `Executer` for each event.

## Symbols

### `dummyExecuter`
#### Description
`dummyExecuter` is a simple struct that implements the `Executer` interface. It is used in tests to verify the behavior of the `Sink` without performing any actual actions.

#### Inputs
This struct has no inputs.

#### Outputs
This struct has no outputs.

#### Internal Logic
The `Execute` method of `dummyExecuter` does nothing and always returns nil.

### `TestSink`
#### Description
`TestSink` is a test function that verifies the behavior of the `Sink` struct.

#### Inputs
This function takes a testing.T pointer as input.

#### Outputs
This function has no outputs.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Arrange:** Creates a new `Sink` instance with a `Nop` logger and a single `dummyExecuter` in the `executers` list.
2. **Act:**
    - Calls the `String` method of the `Sink` and asserts that it returns "templates".
    - Calls the `SendAudits` method with a context and a list of two audit events.
    - Calls the `Close` method of the `Sink`.
3. **Assert:**
    - Asserts that the `SendAudits` and `Close` methods return no errors.

- `audit.Sink`: The `Sink` struct implements the `audit.Sink` interface.
- `audit.Event`: The `SendAudits` method takes a list of `audit.Event` instances as input.
- `Executer`: The `Sink` struct holds a list of `Executer` instances.
- `flipt.SubjectFlag`, `flipt.SubjectConstraint`, `flipt.ActionCreate`, `flipt.ActionUpdate`: Constants used to define the type and action of audit events.
