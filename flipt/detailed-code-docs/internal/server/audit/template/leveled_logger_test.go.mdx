title: "leveled_logger_test.go"
---

## High-level description
The code defines a test suite, `TestLeveledLogger`, which verifies the functionality of the `LeveledLogger` type. This logger is designed to output log messages at different severity levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR) along with associated key-value pairs.

## Symbols
### `TestLeveledLogger`
#### Description
This function is a test function that verifies the functionality of the `LeveledLogger` type. It creates a `LeveledLogger` instance and logs messages at different severity levels, then asserts that the output matches the expected format.

#### Inputs
This function takes no inputs.

#### Outputs
This function has no outputs.

#### Internal Logic
This test follows the standard "arrange, act, assert" pattern:
1. **Arrange:**
    - It creates a `bytes.Buffer` to capture the logger output.
    - It configures a `zap.Logger` with a console encoder that writes to the buffer.
    - It creates a `LeveledLogger` instance using the configured `zap.Logger`.
2. **Act:**
    - It logs messages using the `LeveledLogger` at different severity levels (Debug, Info, Warn, Error) with sample key-value pairs.
3. **Assert:**
    - It synchronizes the logger to ensure all messages are written.
    - It flushes the buffer to ensure all data is written to the buffer.
    - It asserts that the content of the buffer matches the expected log output format, including severity level, message, and key-value pairs.


## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| "bufio" | Used for creating a buffered writer to capture log output. |
| "bytes" | Used for creating a buffer to capture log output. |
| "testing" | Provides the testing framework. |
| "github.com/stretchr/testify/assert" | Used for making assertions in the test function. |
| "github.com/stretchr/testify/require" | Used for making assertions that halt the test upon failure. |
| "go.uber.org/zap" | Provides the logging library used by the `LeveledLogger`. |
| "go.uber.org/zap/zapcore" | Provides core components for configuring the `zap.Logger`. |

## Logging
The code utilizes the `go.uber.org/zap` logging library for its logging functionality. The `LeveledLogger` type wraps a `zap.Logger` and provides a simplified interface for logging messages at different severity levels.
