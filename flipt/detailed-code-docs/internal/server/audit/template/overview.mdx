## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of a template-based audit logging system for Flipt. It provides a mechanism to send audit events to configurable webhook endpoints using predefined templates for the request body and headers. The main components are the `Sink` struct, which implements the `audit.Sink` interface, and the `webhookTemplate` struct, which handles the execution of individual webhook requests.

## What does it do?
The audit template system allows Flipt to send audit log data to external systems for further processing or storage. Here's a simplified workflow:

1. The system is configured with one or more webhook templates, each specifying a target URL, request body template, and headers.
2. When audit events occur in Flipt, they are passed to the `Sink`.
3. The `Sink` iterates through each audit event and executes all configured webhook templates.
4. Each webhook template constructs an HTTP POST request using the provided event data and sends it to the specified URL.
5. The system handles retries with exponential backoff in case of network errors.
6. Any errors encountered during this process are logged and collected.

This allows Flipt administrators to integrate audit logging with their existing monitoring and alerting systems, providing flexibility in how audit data is processed and stored.

## Key Files

### executer.go
This file defines the `webhookTemplate` struct and its methods. It's responsible for executing individual webhook requests. Key features include:
- Custom template function `toJson` for JSON marshaling within templates.
- Retry mechanism with exponential backoff for handling network errors.
- Validation of JSON payload before sending.

### template.go
This file contains the main `Sink` implementation. It:
- Initializes the sink with configured webhook templates.
- Implements the `SendAudits` method to process multiple audit events.
- Manages multiple webhook executors and aggregates errors.

### leveled_logger.go
This file provides a `LeveledLogger` implementation that wraps a `zap.Logger`. It's used to integrate Flipt's logging system with the retryable HTTP client used for webhook requests.

## Dependencies
- github.com/hashicorp/go-retryablehttp (v0.7.4): Used for creating a retryable HTTP client with built-in backoff and retry logic.
- go.uber.org/zap (v1.24.0): Provides fast, structured logging capabilities.
- go.flipt.io/flipt/internal/server/audit: Defines the `audit.Sink` interface and `audit.Event` struct.
- go.flipt.io/flipt/internal/config: Provides configuration structures for webhook templates.

## Configuration
The audit template system is configured through `config.WebhookTemplate` structures, which specify:
- URL: The target webhook endpoint.
- Body: A Go template string for the request body.
- Headers: A map of HTTP headers to include in the request.

The maximum backoff duration for retries is also configurable when creating a new sink.

Example configuration:
```go
webhookTemplates := []config.WebhookTemplate{
    {
        URL:     "https://example.com/audit",
        Body:    `{"event": "{{ .Type }}", "action": "{{ .Action }}"}`,
        Headers: map[string]string{"Authorization": "Bearer token123"},
    },
}
maxBackoffDuration := 5 * time.Minute
sink, err := NewSink(logger, webhookTemplates, maxBackoffDuration)
```

This system provides a flexible and robust way to integrate Flipt's audit logging with external systems, allowing for customized processing and storage of audit events.
