## High-level description
The `webhook.go` file defines a sink for Flipt's audit logs that sends audit events to a configured webhook URL. This allows integrating Flipt's audit trail with external systems for monitoring, alerting, or further processing.

## Code Structure
The `Sink` struct implements the `audit.Sink` interface, which defines methods for sending audit events and closing the sink. The `NewSink` function creates a new `Sink` instance with a configured logger and webhook client. The `SendAudits` method iterates over the provided audit events and sends each event to the webhook using the configured client.

## References
- `audit.Sink`: Interface for audit log sinks.
- `Client`: Interface for sending HTTP requests to the webhook.

## Symbols

### `sinkType`
#### Description
A constant string representing the type of the sink, which is "webhook".

#### Internal Logic
This constant is used for logging and identification purposes.

### `Sink`
#### Description
A struct representing a webhook sink for audit logs. It holds a logger and a webhook client.

#### Inputs
N/A

#### Outputs
N/A

#### Internal Logic
The `Sink` struct implements the `audit.Sink` interface.

### `NewSink`
#### Description
A constructor function that creates a new `Sink` instance.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| logger | `*zap.Logger` | A logger instance for logging events. |
| webhookClient | `Client` | A client for sending HTTP requests to the webhook. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| audit.Sink | `audit.Sink` | A new `Sink` instance that implements the `audit.Sink` interface. |

#### Internal Logic
The function creates a new `Sink` instance with the provided logger and webhook client.

### `Sink.SendAudits`
#### Description
This method sends a batch of audit events to the configured webhook URL.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ctx | `context.Context` | The context for the request. |
| events | `[]audit.Event` | A slice of audit events to be sent. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| error | `error` | An error if any of the events fail to send. |

#### Internal Logic
The method iterates over the provided audit events and sends each event to the webhook using the `webhookClient`. If any errors occur during sending, they are appended to a `multierror` and returned.

### `Sink.Close`
#### Description
This method closes the webhook sink.

#### Inputs
N/A

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| error | `error` | Always returns nil as there's no actual connection to close. |

#### Internal Logic
This method currently does nothing and always returns nil.

### `Sink.String`
#### Description
This method returns a string representation of the sink type.

#### Inputs
N/A

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| string | `string` | The string "webhook", representing the sink type. |

#### Internal Logic
This method returns the value of the `sinkType` constant.

## Dependencies
- `context`
- `github.com/hashicorp/go-multierror`: For collecting and returning multiple errors.
- `go.flipt.io/flipt/internal/server/audit`: For the `audit.Sink` interface and `audit.Event` type.
- `go.uber.org/zap`: For structured logging.

## Error Handling
The `SendAudits` method uses `multierror` to collect and return multiple errors that may occur while sending individual audit events.

## Logging
The `Sink` uses a `zap.Logger` to log errors encountered while sending audit events to the webhook.
