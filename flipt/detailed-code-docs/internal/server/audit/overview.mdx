## High-level description
The `internal/server/audit` directory contains the implementation of Flipt's audit logging system. It provides various sinks for sending audit events, including cloud-based solutions, Kafka, local logging, and webhooks. The package also includes utilities for filtering audit events, encoding them in different formats, and managing their lifecycle.

## What does it do?
This package enables Flipt to record and send audit events to various destinations. It allows administrators to track important actions and changes within the system. The main functionalities include:

1. Defining audit event structures and types for different Flipt entities (flags, segments, rules, etc.).
2. Providing interfaces and implementations for different audit sinks (cloud, Kafka, log, webhook).
3. Offering filtering capabilities to control which audit events are processed.
4. Supporting various encoding formats (JSON, Avro, Protobuf) for audit events.
5. Implementing retry mechanisms and error handling for reliable event delivery.
6. Integrating with OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing.

## Entry points
The main entry points for this package are:

1. `NewSinkSpanExporter` in `audit.go`: Creates a new span exporter that sends audit events to configured sinks.
2. `NewChecker` in `checker.go`: Creates a new checker for filtering audit events.
3. Various `NewSink` functions in subdirectories (e.g., `cloud/NewSink`, `kafka/NewSink`, `log/NewSink`, `webhook/NewSink`): Create specific sink implementations for different audit event destinations.

## Key Files
1. `audit.go`: Defines the core `Sink` interface and implements the `SinkSpanExporter` for OpenTelemetry integration.
2. `events.go`: Defines the `Event` struct and related methods for handling audit events.
3. `types.go`: Contains audit representations of Flipt entities (flags, variants, segments, etc.).
4. `checker.go`: Implements event filtering functionality.
5. Subdirectories (`cloud`, `kafka`, `log`, `template`, `webhook`): Contain specific implementations for different audit sinks.

## Dependencies
- `go.opentelemetry.io/otel`: Used for distributed tracing integration.
- `go.uber.org/zap`: Used for structured logging throughout the package.
- `github.com/hashicorp/go-multierror`: Used for aggregating and handling multiple errors.
- Various other dependencies in subdirectories for specific sink implementations (e.g., Kafka client, HTTP libraries).

## Configuration
The audit system can be configured through various options, including:

1. Enabled sinks (cloud, Kafka, log, webhook).
2. Filtering rules for audit events.
3. Sink-specific configurations (e.g., Kafka brokers, webhook URLs, log file paths).
4. Encoding formats for different sinks.
5. Retry and backoff settings for reliable event delivery.

These configurations are typically set through Flipt's main configuration system and passed to the appropriate constructors when initializing the audit components.

In summary, the `internal/server/audit` package provides a flexible and extensible system for capturing, filtering, and sending audit events to various destinations, allowing Flipt administrators to maintain a detailed record of system activities and changes.
