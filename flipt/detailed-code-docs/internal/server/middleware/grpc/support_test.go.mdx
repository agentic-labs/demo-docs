## High-level description
The code defines a set of test mocks and spies for the gRPC middleware package, specifically for authentication and auditing functionalities. It includes mocks for authentication store, audit sink, and audit exporter, which are used to simulate the behavior of real components during testing.

## Code Structure
The code defines several types: `authStoreMock`, `auditSinkSpy`, and `auditExporterSpy`. `authStoreMock` implements the `storageauth.Store` interface and provides mock implementations for its methods. `auditSinkSpy` acts as a spy for audit events, recording the events sent to it. `auditExporterSpy` uses `auditSinkSpy` to capture and expose audit events for testing purposes.

## Symbols

### `authStoreMock`
#### Description
This struct is a mock implementation of the `storageauth.Store` interface, used for testing purposes. It allows simulating the behavior of the authentication store without relying on a real database.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a mock struct and doesn't have specific inputs.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a mock struct and doesn't have specific outputs.

#### Internal Logic
The methods of this mock struct use `mock.Called` to record the calls and allow setting up predefined responses or errors using `Return` and `Error` methods respectively.

### `auditSinkSpy`
#### Description
This struct acts as a spy for audit events. It implements the `audit.Sink` interface and records all events sent to its `SendAudits` method.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a spy struct and its behavior is based on the calls to its methods.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a spy struct and its main purpose is to record events, not to return specific outputs.

#### Internal Logic
The `SendAudits` method increments a counter to track the number of times it's called and appends the received audit events to an internal slice for later inspection in tests.

### `auditExporterSpy`
#### Description
This struct is a wrapper around `audit.EventExporter` that uses an `auditSinkSpy` to capture and expose audit events for testing.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a spy struct and its behavior is based on the calls to its methods.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a spy struct and its main purpose is to facilitate testing by exposing captured events.

#### Internal Logic
It creates an instance of `auditSinkSpy` and uses it when creating a new `audit.SinkSpanExporter`. It provides methods to access the captured events and the number of times `SendAudits` was called on the underlying spy.
