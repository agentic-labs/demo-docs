## High-level description
The code defines a test suite for the `HttpResponseModifier` function, which is responsible for modifying HTTP responses based on gRPC metadata. It specifically tests for the presence and handling of "etag" and "x-http-code" metadata headers.

## Symbols
### `TestHttpResponseModifier`
#### Description
This function is a test suite that checks the behavior of the `HttpResponseModifier` function. It uses the `httptest` package to simulate HTTP responses and the `google.golang.org/grpc/metadata` package to work with gRPC metadata.

#### Inputs
This is a test function, it takes no inputs.

#### Outputs
This is a test function, it produces no outputs.

#### Internal Logic
The test suite includes two subtests:

* **"etag header exists"**: This subtest verifies that if the gRPC metadata contains an "x-etag" header, the `HttpResponseModifier` function correctly sets the "Etag" header in the HTTP response and removes the "Grpc-Metadata-X-Etag" header.
* **"http code header exists"**: This subtest checks that if the gRPC metadata includes an "x-http-code" header, the `HttpResponseModifier` function sets the HTTP status code accordingly and doesn't set any headers based on the metadata.

Each subtest follows the arrange, act, and assert pattern:

1. **Arrange**: Sets up the test data, including creating a `runtime.ServerMetadata` object with specific metadata, a `httptest.ResponseRecorder` to capture the HTTP response, and a dummy gRPC message.
2. **Act**: Calls the `HttpResponseModifier` function with the prepared context, response recorder, and message.
3. **Assert**: Uses the `require` and `assert` packages to verify the expected behavior, such as checking the HTTP headers and status code in the response recorder.

* `HttpResponseModifier`: The function being tested, which is responsible for modifying HTTP responses based on gRPC metadata.
* `runtime.ServerMetadata`: Used to represent gRPC metadata.
* `httptest.NewRecorder`: Creates a new HTTP response recorder for capturing the response.
