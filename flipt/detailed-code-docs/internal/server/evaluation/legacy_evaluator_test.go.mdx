## High-level description
The `legacy_evaluator_test.go` file contains unit tests for the legacy evaluation logic in Flipt, specifically focusing on how constraints are matched against different data types (string, number, boolean, datetime) and how distributions are applied to determine variant selection. 

These tests cover various scenarios, including matching all/any constraints, handling default variants, and ensuring correct behavior when rollout distributions have 0% values.

## Code Structure
This file primarily consists of test functions, each designed to test a specific aspect of the legacy evaluation logic. The test functions utilize mocks for the storage layer to isolate the evaluation logic and simulate different data retrieval scenarios.

## Symbols

### `Test_matchesString`
#### Description
Tests the `matchesString` function, which checks if a given string value matches a constraint.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a test function. Refer to individual test cases within the function for specific inputs.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a test function. It uses the `assert` package for assertions.

#### Internal Logic
The function iterates through a series of test cases, each defining a constraint and a value. For each case, it calls `matchesString` and asserts whether the returned match result aligns with the expected outcome.

### `Test_matchesNumber`
#### Description
Tests the `matchesNumber` function, which checks if a given string value (parsed as a number) matches a constraint.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a test function. Refer to individual test cases within the function for specific inputs.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a test function. It uses the `assert` package for assertions.

#### Internal Logic
Similar to `Test_matchesString`, this function iterates through test cases, each defining a constraint and a value. It calls `matchesNumber` and asserts the match result and any errors returned. It specifically checks for `ferrors.ErrInvalid` when an error is expected due to invalid input.

### `Test_matchesBool`
#### Description

## Dependencies
The test file imports and uses the following packages:
- `context`
- `errors`
- `testing`
- `github.com/gofrs/uuid`
- `github.com/stretchr/testify/assert`
- `github.com/stretchr/testify/mock`
- `go.flipt.io/flipt/errors`
- `go.flipt.io/flipt/internal/storage`
- `go.flipt.io/flipt/rpc/flipt`
- `go.flipt.io/flipt/rpc/flipt/evaluation`
- `go.uber.org/zap/zaptest`

## Error Handling
The tests use the `assert` package to check for expected errors and error types. In particular, they check for `ferrors.ErrInvalid` in cases where invalid input is provided to the evaluation functions.

## Logging
The tests use `zaptest.NewLogger(t)` to create a logger for testing purposes, which is then passed to the `Evaluator` constructor.

## Performance Considerations
These tests focus on correctness rather than performance. However, they do cover various scenarios that could impact performance in a production environment, such as handling multiple rules, constraints, and distributions.
