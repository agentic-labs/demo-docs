## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for the `EvaluationSnapshotNamespace` function in the `data` package, specifically focusing on the handling of the `If-None-Match` header for caching. 

The tests ensure that the function correctly interacts with the underlying evaluation store to retrieve the version (ETag) and returns a nil response when the header matches, indicating that the client's cached data is up-to-date.

## Code Structure
The code defines a single test function, `TestEvaluationSnapshotNamespace`, which sets up a mock evaluation store and a logger. It then defines a subtest that simulates a request with an `If-None-Match` header and verifies the response and interactions with the mock store.

## Symbols

### `TestEvaluationSnapshotNamespace`
#### Description
This function is a unit test for the `EvaluationSnapshotNamespace` function. It tests the scenario where the `If-None-Match` header in the request context matches the version (ETag) of the data in the store.

#### Inputs
This function takes `t *testing.T` as input, which is a standard testing framework input.

#### Outputs
This function does not return any output value.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Arrange:**
    - Creates a mock instance of the `evaluationStoreMock`.
    - Creates a new logger using `zaptest.NewLogger(t)`.
    - Creates a new instance of the `New` server with the logger and mock store.
    - Defines a subtest named "If-None-Match header match".
    - Creates a mock context with the `If-None-Match` header set to a specific value.
    - Sets up the mock store to return a predefined ETag when `GetVersion` is called.
2. **Act:**
    - Calls the `EvaluationSnapshotNamespace` function with the mock context and a request object.
3. **Assert:**
    - Asserts that the function returns no error.
    - Asserts that the response is nil, indicating a "304 Not Modified" status.
    - Asserts that the mock store's `GetVersion` method was called with the expected arguments.
