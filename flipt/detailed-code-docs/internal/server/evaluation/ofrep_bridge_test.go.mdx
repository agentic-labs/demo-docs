## High-level description
The `internal/server/evaluation/ofrep_bridge_test.go` file contains unit tests for the OFREP (Open Feature Repository) flag evaluation bridge in the Flipt application. It verifies the bridge's ability to correctly evaluate both variant and boolean flags based on provided context and configurations.

## Code Structure
This file consists of two test functions, `TestOFREPFlagEvaluation_Variant` and `TestOFREPFlagEvaluation_Boolean`, both of which test the `OFREPFlagEvaluation` function of the `evaluation` package. They set up mock data and expectations for the underlying storage layer and assert that the evaluation results match the expected values.

## Symbols

### `TestOFREPFlagEvaluation_Variant`
#### Description
This test function verifies the behavior of the `OFREPFlagEvaluation` function when evaluating a variant flag. It sets up a mock flag, evaluation rules, and distributions in the mock storage, then calls `OFREPFlagEvaluation` with specific context. Finally, it asserts that the returned evaluation output matches the expected values, including the flag key, reason, variant, and value.

#### Inputs
This function takes the `*testing.T` instance as an input, which is used for reporting test results and errors.

#### Outputs
This function does not return any values.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Arrange:**
    - Defines test variables like `flagKey`, `namespaceKey`, and creates a mock storage (`evaluationStoreMock`).
    - Creates a new `evaluation` service instance (`New`) using the mock storage and a test logger.
    - Defines a mock `flipt.Flag` representing a variant flag.
    - Configures the mock storage to return the mock flag, evaluation rules, and distributions when queried.
2. **Act:**
    - Calls the `OFREPFlagEvaluation` function with a context, flag key, namespace key, and a map representing the evaluation context.
3. **Assert:**
    - Checks for any errors during the evaluation process.
    - Asserts that the returned `output` matches the expected values for a variant flag evaluation. This includes checking the `FlagKey`, `Reason`, `Variant`, and `Value` fields of the output.

### `TestOFREPFlagEvaluation_Boolean`
#### Description
This test function verifies the behavior of the `OFREPFlagEvaluation` function when evaluating a boolean flag. It follows a similar structure to `TestOFREPFlagEvaluation_Variant`, setting up a mock boolean flag and ensuring the evaluation returns the expected default values.

#### Inputs
This function takes the `*testing.T` instance as an input, which is used for reporting test results and errors.

#### Outputs
This function does not return any values.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Arrange:**
    - Defines test variables like `flagKey`, `namespaceKey`, and creates a mock storage (`evaluationStoreMock`).
    - Creates a new `evaluation` service instance (`New`) using the mock storage and a test logger.
    - Defines a mock `flipt.Flag` representing a boolean flag.
    - Configures the mock storage to return the mock flag and an empty list of evaluation rollouts when queried.
2. **Act:**
    - Calls the `OFREPFlagEvaluation` function with a context, flag key, namespace key, and a map representing the evaluation context.
3. **Assert:**
    - Checks for any errors during the evaluation process.
    - Asserts that the returned `output` matches the expected values for a boolean flag evaluation. This includes checking the `FlagKey`, `Reason`, `Variant`, and `Value` fields of the output.
