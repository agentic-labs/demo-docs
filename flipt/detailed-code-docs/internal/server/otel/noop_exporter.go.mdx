## High-level description
This code defines a "no-op" span exporter for OpenTelemetry. It implements the `trace.SpanExporter` interface but doesn't actually do anything with the spans it receives, effectively discarding them. This is useful for testing or for disabling tracing without modifying application code.

## Code Structure
The code defines a single type `noopSpanExporter` which implements the `trace.SpanExporter` interface. 

## References
* `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/trace` - This package provides the interface definitions for OpenTelemetry tracing.

## Symbols

### `noopSpanExporter`
#### Description
This type represents a no-op span exporter that discards all received spans. It implements the `trace.SpanExporter` interface.

### `NewNoopSpanExporter`
#### Description
This function creates and returns a new instance of the `noopSpanExporter`.

#### Inputs
* None

#### Outputs
* `trace.SpanExporter`: A new instance of the `noopSpanExporter`.

### `(*noopSpanExporter) ExportSpans`
#### Description
This method implements the `ExportSpans` method of the `trace.SpanExporter` interface. It receives a context and a slice of spans, but it doesn't do anything with them and simply returns `nil` to indicate success.

#### Inputs
* `ctx context.Context`: The context for the export operation.
* `spans []trace.ReadOnlySpan`: A slice of read-only spans to be exported.

#### Outputs
* `error`: Always returns `nil` indicating successful (no-op) export.

### `(*noopSpanExporter) Shutdown`
#### Description
This method implements the `Shutdown` method of the `trace.SpanExporter` interface. It receives a context but doesn't perform any shutdown actions and simply returns `nil`.

#### Inputs
* `ctx context.Context`: The context for the shutdown operation.

#### Outputs
* `error`: Always returns `nil` indicating successful shutdown.
