## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of an in-memory cache for the Flipt project. It provides a simple and efficient caching mechanism that wraps the `gocache.Cache` to implement the `Cacher` interface. The implementation includes methods for creating a new cache, getting, setting, and deleting cache entries.

## What does it do?
The memory cache in this directory serves as a temporary storage solution for frequently accessed data in the Flipt project. It allows the application to store and retrieve data quickly without the need to access slower storage systems repeatedly. Here's a simplified explanation of its functionality:

1. Create a cache: The application can create a new in-memory cache with specific configuration settings like how long items should be stored.
2. Store data: The cache can store key-value pairs, where the key is a string and the value is any piece of data (stored as bytes).
3. Retrieve data: When the application needs a piece of data, it can quickly check the cache using a key. If the data is there, it's returned immediately without needing to fetch it from a slower source.
4. Remove data: The application can also remove specific items from the cache when they're no longer needed.

This caching mechanism helps improve the overall performance of the Flipt application by reducing the time and resources required to access frequently used data.

## Key Files

### cache.go
This file contains the main implementation of the memory cache. It defines the `Cache` struct, which wraps the `gocache.Cache` from the `github.com/patrickmn/go-cache` package. The file includes the following key components:

1. `NewCache` function: Creates a new instance of the memory cache with the provided configuration.
2. `Get` method: Retrieves a value from the cache for a given key.
3. `Set` method: Sets a value in the cache for a given key.
4. `Delete` method: Removes a value from the cache for a given key.
5. `String` method: Returns the cache type as a string ("memory").

### cache_test.go
This file contains unit tests for the memory cache implementation. It includes tests for:

1. Creating a new cache
2. Setting values in the cache
3. Getting values from the cache
4. Deleting values from the cache

The tests ensure that the cache operations work correctly and handle various scenarios, including cache hits, misses, and deletions.

## Dependencies
The memory cache implementation relies on the following external libraries:

1. github.com/patrickmn/go-cache (v2.1.0+incompatible)
   - Purpose: Provides the underlying in-memory cache implementation.
   - Chosen for its simplicity, efficiency, and thread-safety.

2. github.com/stretchr/testify (v1.8.2)
   - Purpose: Used in the test file for assertions and test utilities.
   - Chosen for its comprehensive set of testing tools and readability.

Internal dependencies include:
- go.flipt.io/flipt/internal/cache: Provides cache-related utilities and interfaces.
- go.flipt.io/flipt/internal/config: Provides configuration structures for the cache.

## Configuration
The memory cache can be configured using the `config.CacheConfig` struct. This configuration is passed to the `NewCache` function when creating a new cache instance. The configuration options include:

- TTL (Time To Live): Specifies how long items should remain in the cache before expiring.
- Eviction Interval: Determines how often the cache should check for and remove expired items.

Example usage:
```go
cfg := config.CacheConfig{
    TTL:              time.Minute * 5,
    EvictionInterval: time.Minute,
}
cache := NewCache(cfg)
```

The cache implementation uses these configuration values to initialize the underlying `gocache.Cache` with the specified TTL and eviction interval.

In summary, this memory cache implementation provides a simple and efficient caching solution for the Flipt project, allowing for quick storage and retrieval of data in memory. It's designed to be easy to use and integrate into the larger application, with configurable options for cache behavior and comprehensive unit tests to ensure reliability.
