## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of a Redis-based caching mechanism for the Flipt project. It provides a `Cache` struct that wraps a Redis client and implements methods for getting, setting, and deleting cache entries. The code also includes configuration for the Redis client, including TLS support, and comprehensive unit tests.

## What does it do?
The Redis cache implementation in this directory allows Flipt to store and retrieve data quickly using Redis as a caching layer. It provides the following main functionalities:

1. Setting key-value pairs in the Redis cache with a configurable Time-To-Live (TTL).
2. Retrieving values from the cache using keys.
3. Deleting entries from the cache.
4. Configuring and creating a Redis client with various options, including TLS support.
5. Handling cache hits, misses, and errors, with associated metrics recording.

This caching mechanism helps improve the performance of Flipt by reducing the need to fetch frequently accessed data from slower storage systems.

## Key Files

1. `cache.go`: Implements the main `Cache` struct and its methods for interacting with the Redis cache.
2. `client.go`: Provides the `NewClient` function for creating and configuring a Redis client based on the provided configuration.
3. `cache_test.go`: Contains unit tests for the cache operations (Set, Get, Delete) and includes setup code for running tests against a Redis container.
4. `client_test.go`: Includes unit tests for the Redis client implementation, focusing on TLS configuration options.

## Dependencies
The Redis cache implementation relies on the following key external libraries:

1. `github.com/go-redis/cache/v9`: Used for the Redis client implementation.
2. `github.com/redis/go-redis/v9`: Provides the core Redis client functionality.
3. `github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-go`: Used in tests to create Redis containers for testing purposes.
4. `github.com/stretchr/testify`: Used for test assertions and requirements.

These dependencies were chosen to provide robust Redis functionality, efficient testing capabilities, and reliable assertion mechanisms in the test suite.

## Configuration
The Redis cache and client can be configured using the `config.CacheConfig` and `config.RedisCacheConfig` structures. Key configurable fields include:

- Redis server address and port
- TLS configuration options (enable/disable TLS, CA certificate, insecure skip verify)
- Connection pool settings (pool size, minimum idle connections)
- Timeouts (dial timeout, read timeout, write timeout)
- Cache TTL (Time-To-Live) for stored entries

Example configuration usage:

```go
cfg := config.RedisCacheConfig{
    Host:     "localhost",
    Port:     6379,
    Password: "password",
    TLS: config.TLSConfig{
        Enabled:  true,
        CABundle: []byte("CA certificate content"),
    },
    PoolSize:     10,
    MinIdleConns: 5,
}

client, err := redis.NewClient(cfg)
if err != nil {
    // Handle error
}

cache := redis.NewCache(cacheConfig, client)
```

This configuration allows for flexible setup of the Redis cache to suit different deployment environments and performance requirements.
