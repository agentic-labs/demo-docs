## High-level description
This code defines a Redis client configuration and initialization for the Flipt project. It provides a function to create a new Redis client with TLS support and various connection options based on the provided configuration.

## Code Structure
The main function `NewClient` creates and configures a Redis client based on the provided `RedisCacheConfig`. It sets up TLS if required and configures various connection parameters. The `caBundle` function is a helper that retrieves the CA certificate for TLS connections.

## Symbols

### NewClient
#### Description
Creates and returns a new Redis client based on the provided configuration.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| cfg | config.RedisCacheConfig | Configuration for the Redis client |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| client | *goredis.Client | Configured Redis client |
| error | error | Any error encountered during client creation |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up TLS configuration if required
2. Configures the Redis client with various options from the provided configuration
3. Returns the configured Redis client

### caBundle
#### Description
Helper function to retrieve the CA certificate for TLS connections.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| cfg | config.RedisCacheConfig | Configuration for the Redis client |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| []byte | []byte | CA certificate bytes |
| error | error | Any error encountered while retrieving the CA certificate |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if CA certificate is provided as bytes in the configuration
2. If not, checks if a CA certificate file path is provided and reads the file
3. Returns the CA certificate bytes or an empty byte slice if not provided

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| crypto/tls | For TLS configuration |
| crypto/x509 | For certificate handling |
| fmt | For string formatting |
| os | For file operations |
| github.com/redis/go-redis/v9 | Redis client library |
| go.flipt.io/flipt/internal/config | For configuration structures |

## Error Handling
The code includes error handling for file operations, certificate parsing, and client creation. Errors are propagated up to the caller of `NewClient`.

## Performance Considerations
The Redis client is configured with various performance-related options such as connection pool size, idle connections, and timeouts. These can be adjusted through the `RedisCacheConfig` structure to optimize performance for specific use cases.
