## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for a Redis cache implementation in Go. It tests the basic operations of the cache (Set, Get, Delete) and includes setup code for running tests against a Redis container using testcontainers-go.

## Code Structure
The file defines several test functions that use a common setup function `newCache` to create a Redis cache instance for testing. It also includes a helper function `setupRedis` to create a Redis container for testing purposes.

## Symbols

### TestSet
#### Description
Tests the Set operation of the Redis cache.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up a new cache instance
2. Attempts to set a key-value pair in the cache
3. Asserts that no error occurred during the operation

### TestGet
#### Description
Tests the Get operation of the Redis cache.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up a new cache instance
2. Sets a key-value pair in the cache
3. Retrieves the value for the existing key and asserts its correctness
4. Attempts to get a non-existent key and asserts that it's not found
5. Retrieves the existing key again to ensure it still exists

### TestDelete
#### Description
Tests the Delete operation of the Redis cache.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up a new cache instance
2. Sets a key-value pair in the cache
3. Retrieves the value to ensure it exists
4. Deletes the key from the cache
5. Attempts to retrieve the deleted key and asserts that it's not found

### setupRedis
#### Description
Creates and starts a Redis container for testing purposes.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ctx | context.Context | The context for container operations |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| *redisContainer | *redisContainer | A struct containing the container and connection details |
| error | error | Any error that occurred during setup |

#### Internal Logic
1. Defines container request parameters
2. Creates and starts a Redis container
3. Retrieves the mapped port and host IP
4. Returns a redisContainer struct with connection details

### newCache
#### Description
Creates a new Cache instance for testing, either using a provided Redis address or starting a new Redis container.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| t | *testing.T | The testing object |
| ctx | context.Context | The context for cache operations |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| *Cache | *Cache | The created Cache instance |
| func() | function | A teardown function to clean up resources |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if running in short test mode
2. Uses a provided Redis address or starts a new Redis container
3. Creates a new Redis client and Cache instance
4. Returns the Cache instance and a teardown function

## Error Handling
The tests use `assert.NoError` and `require.NoError` to check for and handle errors during test execution. Any unexpected errors will cause the tests to fail.
