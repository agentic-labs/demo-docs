## High-level description
This code defines a generic `Option` type and a function `ApplyAll` to apply a series of options to a value in a functional way. This pattern is useful for configuring structs or objects with a variable number of optional parameters.

## Code Structure
The `ApplyAll` function iterates through a variadic list of `Option` functions and applies each one to the provided value.

## Symbols

### `Option[T any]`
#### Description
`Option` is a generic type representing a function that takes a pointer to a value of type `T` and modifies it in place. It's used to define single configuration options.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a type definition, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a type definition, not a function.

#### Internal Logic
N/A - This is a type definition, not a function.

### `ApplyAll[T any](t *T, opts ...Option[T])`
#### Description
`ApplyAll` is a generic function that applies a series of `Option` functions to a value.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| t | `*T` | A pointer to the value to be configured. |
| opts | `...Option[T]` | A variadic list of `Option` functions to apply. |

#### Outputs
N/A - This function modifies the value pointed to by `t` in place.

#### Internal Logic
The function iterates through the `opts` slice and calls each `Option` function with the provided `t` pointer. This allows each option to modify the value in a specific way.
```go
for _, opt := range opts {
		opt(t)
	}
```
## Side Effects
This code modifies the value pointed to by the `t` parameter in the `ApplyAll` function.

## Performance Considerations
The performance of this code is linear to the number of options applied. This is generally not a concern unless a very large number of options are used.
