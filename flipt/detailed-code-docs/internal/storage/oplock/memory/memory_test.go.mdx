## High-level description
The `memory_test.go` file contains a single test function, `Test_Harness`, which verifies the functionality of the in-memory implementation of the `oplock.Service` interface. This test ensures that the locking mechanism behaves as expected under concurrent access.

## References
- `oplocktesting.Harness`: This function, defined in `oplock/testing/testing.go`, provides a reusable test harness for any implementation of the `oplock.Service` interface.

## Symbols
### `Test_Harness`
#### Description
This test function utilizes the `oplocktesting.Harness` to validate the behavior of the in-memory `oplock.Service` implementation. It specifically checks if the lock acquisition happens sequentially with the defined interval under concurrent requests.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| t | *testing.T | Testing object used for reporting test results and logging. |

#### Outputs
This function does not return any values.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Initialization:**
    - Sets up a channel `acquiredAt` to track lock acquisition timestamps.
    - Defines the lock interval (`interval`) as 2 seconds.
    - Creates a test operation (`op`) named "test".
    - Initializes a cancellable context (`ctx`) for managing goroutines.
2. **Concurrent Lock Acquisition:**
    - Launches five goroutines using an `errgroup` to simulate concurrent lock acquisition attempts.
    - Each goroutine repeatedly tries to acquire the lock for the "test" operation with a 2-second interval.
    - Upon successful acquisition, the timestamp is sent to the `acquiredAt` channel.
3. **Validation:**
    - After all goroutines have finished or the context is canceled, the test verifies the following:
        - **Total Acquisition Time:** Ensures that acquiring the lock five times took at least 8 seconds (4 intervals).
        - **Sequential Acquisition:** Asserts that the lock acquisitions occurred in strictly ascending order of timestamps.
        - **Interval Adherence:** Confirms that each acquisition happened at least 2 seconds after the previous one.
4. **Cleanup:**
    - Cancels the context to stop the goroutines.
    - Waits for all goroutines to finish and checks for unexpected errors.
    - Closes the `acquiredAt` channel.

## Dependencies
