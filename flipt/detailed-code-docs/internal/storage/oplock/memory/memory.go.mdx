## High-level description
The `memory` package provides an in-memory implementation of the `oplock.Service` interface. This implementation is suitable for single-instance or in-process use cases where multiple Flipt instances don't need to coordinate access to shared resources.

## Code Structure
The `Service` struct holds a mutex (`mu`) to protect concurrent access to the in-memory map (`ops`) that stores lock entries. The `TryAcquire` method uses this mutex to ensure thread safety when checking and updating lock entries.

## References
- `oplock.Operation`: Represents a unique operation name for locking.
- `oplock.LockEntry`: Represents information about an acquired lock.

## Symbols

### `Service`
#### Description
The `Service` struct represents the in-memory implementation of the operation lock service. It stores lock entries in a map protected by a mutex.

#### Inputs
This struct has no inputs.

#### Outputs
This struct has no outputs.

#### Internal Logic
The `Service` struct uses a mutex (`mu`) to protect concurrent access to its internal map (`ops`) of lock entries.

### `New`
#### Description
The `New` function constructs and initializes a new `Service` instance with an empty map of lock entries.

#### Inputs
This function has no inputs.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| (unnamed) | *Service | A pointer to a new `Service` instance. |

#### Internal Logic
The function initializes a new `Service` struct with an empty map of `oplock.Operation` to `oplock.LockEntry`.

### `TryAcquire`
#### Description
The `TryAcquire` method attempts to acquire a lock for a given operation and duration. It checks if the lock is available and, if so, creates a new lock entry or updates an existing one.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ctx | context.Context | The context for the operation. |
| operation | oplock.Operation | The name of the operation to acquire a lock for. |
| duration | time.Duration | The desired duration of the lock. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| acquired | bool | True if the lock was acquired successfully, false otherwise. |
| entry | oplock.LockEntry | The lock entry associated with the operation. |
| err | error | An error if one occurred, nil otherwise. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Acquires a mutex to ensure exclusive access to the lock entries.
2. Checks if a lock entry exists for the given operation.
   - If no entry exists, creates a new entry with the current time as the last acquired time and the calculated acquired until time.
   - If an entry exists and its `AcquiredUntil` time is before the current time, the lock is considered expired. The entry is updated with a new version, the current time as the last acquired time, and the calculated acquired until time.
   - If an entry exists and its `AcquiredUntil` time is after the current time, the lock is considered acquired by another process.
3. Releases the mutex.
4. Returns the acquired flag, the lock entry, and any errors encountered.

## Side Effects
This code modifies the internal state of the `Service` instance by adding or updating lock entries in its map.

## Dependencies
- `context`: Provides a mechanism for carrying request-scoped data and cancellation signals.
- `sync`: Provides basic synchronization primitives like mutexes.
- `time`: Provides functionality for measuring and displaying time.
- `go.flipt.io/flipt/internal/storage/oplock`: Defines the `Operation` and `LockEntry` types and the `Service` interface.

## Error Handling
This code does not implement specific error handling beyond returning an error value from the `TryAcquire` method.
