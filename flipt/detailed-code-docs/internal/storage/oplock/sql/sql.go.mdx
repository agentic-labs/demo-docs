## High-level description
The `sql.go` file implements the `oplock.Service` interface for managing operation locks using a SQL database. This ensures that long-running operations, like data imports, can acquire a lock and prevent concurrent executions.

## Code Structure
The `Service` struct holds the dependencies for the SQL implementation, including a logger, a SQL driver, and a statement builder. The `TryAcquire` function attempts to acquire a lock, while `acquireEntry`, `insertEntry`, and `readEntry` handle the underlying database operations.

## Symbols
### `Service`
#### Description
The `Service` struct represents the operation lock service backed by a SQL database.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a struct definition.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a struct definition.

### `New`
#### Description
Constructs and configures a new `Service` instance.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| logger | `*zap.Logger` | The logger instance for recording events. |
| driver | `storagesql.Driver` | The SQL driver for interacting with the database. |
| builder | `sq.StatementBuilderType` | The statement builder for constructing SQL queries. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| service | `*Service` | A pointer to the newly created `Service` instance. |

#### Internal Logic
The function simply initializes a new `Service` struct with the provided logger, driver, and builder.

### `TryAcquire`
#### Description
Attempts to acquire a lock for the given operation and duration.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ctx | `context.Context` | The context for the operation. |
| operation | `oplock.Operation` | The name of the operation to acquire a lock for. |
| duration | `time.Duration` | The desired duration of the lock. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| acquired | `bool` | True if the lock was acquired successfully, false otherwise. |
| entry | `oplock.LockEntry` | The lock entry associated with the operation. |
| err | `error` | An error if the operation fails. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Reads the lock entry for the given operation from the database.
2. If the entry doesn't exist, attempts to insert a new entry with the specified duration.
    - If the insert fails due to a uniqueness constraint violation, it means a concurrent operation acquired the lock. In this case, it re-reads the entry and returns it.
3. If the entry exists, checks if the `AcquiredUntil` timestamp has elapsed.
    - If the timestamp hasn't elapsed, the lock is still active, so it returns `false`.
4. If the timestamp has elapsed, attempts to acquire the lock by updating the entry with a new `AcquiredUntil` timestamp.
5. Returns `true` and the updated entry if the lock is acquired successfully.

### `acquireEntry`
#### Description
Attempts to acquire an existing lock entry by updating its `AcquiredUntil` timestamp.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ctx | `context.Context` | The context for the operation. |
| entry | `*oplock.LockEntry` | A pointer to the lock entry to acquire. |
| dur | `time.Duration` | The desired duration of the lock. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| acquired | `bool` | True if the lock was acquired successfully, false otherwise. |
| err | `error` | An error if the operation fails. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Constructs an SQL UPDATE query to update the entry's `version`, `last_acquired_at`, and `acquired_until` columns.
2. The query includes a WHERE clause to ensure that the entry hasn't been modified by another operation.
3. Executes the query and checks the number of rows affected.
    - If no rows are affected, it means the entry's version has changed, indicating another operation acquired the lock.
4. If the update is successful, updates the provided `entry` with the new values and returns `true`.

### `insertEntry`
#### Description
Inserts a new lock entry into the database.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ctx | `context.Context` | The context for the operation. |
| op | `oplock.Operation` | The name of the operation to create a lock entry for. |
| dur | `time.Duration` | The desired duration of the lock. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| entry | `oplock.LockEntry` | The newly created lock entry. |
| err | `error` | An error if the operation fails. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a new `oplock.LockEntry` with the provided operation, an initial version of 1, and the current timestamp for `LastAcquired` and `AcquiredUntil`.
2. Constructs an SQL INSERT query to insert the new entry into the `operation_lock` table.
3. Executes the query and returns the created entry.

### `readEntry`
#### Description
Reads the lock entry for the given operation from the database.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ctx | `context.Context` | The context for the operation. |
| operation | `oplock.Operation` | The name of the operation to read the lock entry for. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| entry | `oplock.LockEntry` | The lock entry associated with the operation. |
| err | `error` | An error if the operation fails, such as the entry not being found. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Constructs an SQL SELECT query to retrieve the entry for the given operation.
2. Executes the query and scans the result into a new `oplock.LockEntry`.
3. Returns the retrieved entry.

## Error Handling
The code uses the `errors` package to wrap and annotate errors for better context. It specifically handles `errors.ErrNotFound` when reading entries, indicating that a lock for the operation doesn't exist.
