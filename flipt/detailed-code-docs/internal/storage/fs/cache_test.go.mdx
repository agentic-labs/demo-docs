## High-level description
The code defines a `SnapshotCache` struct and its associated methods, which implement an in-memory cache for snapshots with a fixed size and LRU eviction policy. It's used to cache snapshots retrieved from different storage backends, improving performance by reducing the need to repeatedly fetch the same snapshot data.

## Code Structure
The `SnapshotCache` struct uses a `sync.Map` to store snapshots, keyed by a combination of reference and revision. It also maintains a doubly linked list to track the recency of accessed snapshots for eviction purposes. The `AddFixed`, `Get`, and `AddOrBuild` methods interact with the cache, adding, retrieving, and building snapshots as needed.

## Symbols

### `Test_SnapshotCache`
#### Description
This function is a test suite for the `SnapshotCache` struct. It tests various scenarios like adding fixed references, adding or building new references with existing/new revisions, handling cache evictions, and concurrent access to the cache.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| t | *testing.T | Testing object used for assertions and reporting. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| None | | |

#### Internal Logic
The test suite uses a mock `snapshotBuilder` to simulate building snapshots from revisions. It performs a series of operations on the `SnapshotCache` and asserts the expected behavior, including:
- Adding fixed references to the cache.
- Adding or building new references with existing and new revisions.
- Verifying that the cache returns the correct snapshots for given references.
- Checking that the cache evicts the least recently used entries when exceeding its capacity.
- Ensuring that concurrent access to the cache doesn't lead to inconsistencies.

### `Test_SnapshotCache_Concurrently`
#### Description
This function is a test for the `SnapshotCache` struct, specifically focusing on its behavior under concurrent access. It simulates multiple goroutines concurrently adding and retrieving snapshots from the cache.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| t | *testing.T | Testing object used for assertions and reporting. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| None | | |

#### Internal Logic
The test creates a `SnapshotCache` with a fixed size and a mock `snapshotBuilder`. It then launches multiple goroutines, each attempting to add or build snapshots with different references and revisions. The test ensures that all goroutines can successfully interact with the cache without errors and that the cache maintains its integrity under concurrent access. It also verifies that the mock builder's build counts reflect the expected cache behavior, with frequently accessed revisions being built fewer times due to caching.

### `snapshotBuiler`
#### Description
The `snapshotBuiler` is a helper struct used in the tests to simulate building snapshots from revisions. It keeps track of how many times each revision has been built, allowing the tests to verify the cache's behavior.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| snaps | map[string]*Snapshot | A map of revisions to their corresponding snapshots. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| *snapshotBuiler | | A pointer to the initialized `snapshotBuiler`. |

#### Internal Logic
The `snapshotBuiler` stores a map of revisions to snapshots and a map of revisions to their build counts. The `build` method simulates building a snapshot for a given revision by incrementing its build count and returning the corresponding snapshot from the `snaps` map.
