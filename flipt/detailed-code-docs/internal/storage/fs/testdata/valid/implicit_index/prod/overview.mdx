## High-level description
This directory contains configuration files for feature flags and segments in a production environment. The files define various feature flags, their properties, targeting rules, and user segments for a feature management system.

## What does it do?
This directory stores configuration data that controls the behavior of features in a production environment. It allows developers and product managers to:

1. Define feature flags: These are toggles that can turn specific features on or off.
2. Create variants: Different versions of a feature that can be tested or rolled out.
3. Set up targeting rules: Determine which users or groups of users see specific features or variants.
4. Define user segments: Group users based on certain attributes or behaviors.
5. Configure gradual rollouts: Slowly introduce new features to a percentage of users over time.

This setup enables teams to perform A/B testing, canary releases, and feature toggles without needing to deploy new code for each change. It provides a flexible way to control feature visibility and behavior in production.

## Key Files

1. `features.yml`
   This file contains the main configuration for feature flags and segments. It defines:
   - Individual feature flags with their properties
   - Variants of features
   - Targeting rules
   - Rollout strategies
   - User segments with their constraints

   Example structure:
   ```yaml
   flags:
     - key: prod-flag-1
       name: "Production Flag 1"
       description: "A feature flag for production"
       enabled: true
       variants:
         - key: prod-variant
           # variant properties
       rules:
         - segment: segment2
           # rule properties
   segments:
     - key: segment2
       name: "Segment 2"
       match_type: ANY_MATCH_TYPE
       description: "A user segment"
       constraints:
         # constraint properties
   ```

2. `prod.features.yaml`
   This file is similar to `features.yml` but includes a namespace definition. It contains:
   - A `namespace` field set to "production"
   - Feature flag definitions
   - Segment definitions

   Example structure:
   ```yaml
   namespace: production
   flags:
     - key: prod-flag
       # flag properties
   segments:
     - key: segment1
       # segment properties
   ```

3. `prod.yml`
   This file is empty in the current configuration but could potentially be used for additional production-specific settings in the future.

## Configuration
The configuration in this directory is primarily done through YAML files. The main configurable elements are:

1. Feature Flags:
   - `key`: Unique identifier for the flag
   - `name`: Human-readable name
   - `description`: Purpose of the flag
   - `enabled`: Boolean to enable/disable the flag
   - `variants`: Different versions of the feature
   - `rules`: Targeting rules for segments
   - `rollouts`: Gradual rollout strategies

2. Segments:
   - `key`: Unique identifier for the segment
   - `name`: Human-readable name
   - `match_type`: How constraints are evaluated (e.g., "ANY_MATCH_TYPE")
   - `description`: Purpose of the segment
   - `constraints`: Conditions defining the segment based on user properties

3. Namespace:
   - Defined in `prod.features.yaml` as "production"

These configuration files allow for fine-grained control over feature visibility and behavior in the production environment. By modifying these files, teams can quickly adjust which features are available to which users without needing to deploy new code.
