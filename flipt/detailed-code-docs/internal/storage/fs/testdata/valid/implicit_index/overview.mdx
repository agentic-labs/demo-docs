## High-level description
This directory contains configuration files for feature flags and segments in both production and staging environments. It is part of a larger feature management system that allows for dynamic control of feature releases, A/B testing, and user targeting without code changes. The directory is organized into two main subdirectories: `prod` for production configurations and `staging` for staging environment configurations.

## What does it do?
The configuration files in this directory serve several crucial functions in a feature management system:

1. Feature Flag Definition: They define various feature flags with properties like name, description, and enabled status. These flags allow developers to turn specific features on or off in the application dynamically.

2. A/B Testing Configuration: For each feature flag, multiple variants can be defined, enabling A/B testing or multivariate testing of different feature versions.

3. Targeting Rules: The configurations specify rules for targeting feature flags to specific segments of users, allowing for personalized experiences or controlled feature releases.

4. Gradual Rollouts: They define rollout strategies for gradually releasing features to increasing percentages of users, helping manage risk during new feature releases.

5. User Segmentation: The system defines user segments based on specific criteria (like user properties or behaviors), which can be used to target feature flags to specific user groups.

6. Environment-specific Configuration: By separating configurations into `prod` and `staging` directories, the system allows for environment-specific settings and testing before production deployment.

This setup enables development teams to:
- Perform A/B testing and canary releases
- Implement feature toggles
- Control feature visibility and behavior in different environments
- Gradually introduce new features to users
- Personalize user experiences based on defined segments

All of these capabilities are achieved without needing to deploy new code for each change, providing a flexible and powerful way to manage feature releases and experiments.

## Key Files

1. Production Configuration (`prod` directory):
   - `features.yml`: Main configuration file for production feature flags and segments.
   - `prod.features.yaml`: Similar to `features.yml` but includes a namespace definition set to "production".
   - `prod.yml`: Currently empty, potentially for future production-specific settings.

2. Staging Configuration (`staging` directory):
   - `features.yml`: Main configuration file for staging feature flags and segments, with namespace set to "staging".
   - `staging.features.yaml`: Alternative or additional configuration file for staging features and segments.
   - `staging.yml`: Currently empty, possibly for future staging-specific configurations.

These files contain detailed configurations for feature flags, variants, targeting rules, rollout strategies, and user segments specific to each environment.

## Configuration
The configuration in both production and staging environments is primarily done through YAML files. Key configurable elements include:

1. Feature Flags:
   ```yaml
   flags:
     - key: flag-key
       name: "Flag Name"
       description: "Flag description"
       enabled: true
       variants:
         - key: variant-key
           # variant properties
       rules:
         - segment: segment-key
           # rule properties
       type: BOOLEAN_FLAG_TYPE
       rollouts:
         - description: "Rollout description"
           segment: segment-key
           threshold:
             percentage: 50
   ```

2. Segments:
   ```yaml
   segments:
     - key: segment-key
       name: "Segment Name"
       match_type: ANY_MATCH_TYPE
       description: "Segment description"
       constraints:
         - type: STRING_COMPARISON_TYPE
           property: user-property
           operator: eq
           value: "property-value"
   ```

3. Namespace:
   ```yaml
   namespace: production  # or staging
   ```

These configurations allow for fine-grained control over feature visibility and behavior in both production and staging environments. By modifying these files, teams can quickly adjust which features are available to which users, conduct experiments, and manage gradual feature rollouts without needing to deploy new code.

The separation of configurations into production and staging environments enables teams to test and validate changes in a staging environment before applying them to production, ensuring a more controlled and reliable feature management process.
