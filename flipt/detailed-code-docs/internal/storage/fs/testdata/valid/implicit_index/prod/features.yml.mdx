## High-level description
This YAML file defines feature flags and segments for a production environment. It specifies flag keys, names, descriptions, variants, rules, and segment definitions with match criteria.

## Code Structure
This file does not contain code. It is a YAML file defining data structures for feature flags and segments. 

## Symbols
### `features.yml`
#### Description
This YAML file defines feature flags and segments for a production environment.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a data file.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a data file.

#### Internal Logic
The file is structured into two main sections:

* **`flags`**: Defines individual feature flags.
    * Each flag has a `key`, `name`, `description`, `enabled` status, and optional `variants`, `rules`, and `rollouts`.
    * `variants` define different variations of the flag with associated properties.
    * `rules` specify targeting rules based on segments and rollout percentages.
    * `rollouts` define gradual rollout strategies based on segments or thresholds.
* **`segments`**: Defines segments used for targeting flags.
    * Each segment has a `key`, `name`, `match_type`, `description`, and `constraints`.
    * `constraints` define the criteria for a user to be part of the segment.

#### Example
```yaml
flags:
  - key: prod-flag-1
    # ... other flag properties
    variants:
      - key: prod-variant
        # ... variant properties
    rules:
      - segment: segment2  # Reference to a segment defined below
        # ... rule properties
segments:
  - key: segment2
    # ... segment properties
```

## Configuration
This file acts as a configuration for feature flags and segments. The specific options and their meanings are embedded within the YAML structure.
