title: "prod.features.yaml"
---

## High-level description
The code is a YAML file that defines feature flags and segments for a production environment. It includes details like flag keys, descriptions, variants, rules, and segment definitions with constraints.

## Code Structure
This code represents data in YAML format. It defines a `namespace`, `flags`, and `segments`. 
Flags can have `variants`, `rules`, and `rollouts`.
Segments can have `constraints`.

## Symbols
### `prod.features.yaml`
#### Description
This YAML file defines feature flags and segments for a production environment. 

#### Internal Logic
The file is structured with three main sections:

* **`namespace`**: Defines the namespace for the features and segments.
* **`flags`**:  Lists the feature flags with their configurations. Each flag includes:
    * **`key`**: Unique identifier for the flag.
    * **`name`**: Human-readable name of the flag.
    * **`description`**: Description of the flag's purpose.
    * **`enabled`**: Boolean value indicating if the flag is enabled or not.
    * **`variants`**: (Optional) List of variants for the flag, each with a key and optional attributes.
    * **`rules`**: (Optional) Rules for targeting specific segments with variants and rollout percentages.
    * **`rollouts`**: (Optional) Defines rollout strategy for the flag based on segments or thresholds.
* **`segments`**: Defines segments based on user attributes. Each segment includes:
    * **`key`**: Unique identifier for the segment.
    * **`name`**: Human-readable name of the segment.
    * **`match_type`**: Defines how the constraints are evaluated (e.g., "ANY_MATCH_TYPE").
    * **`description`**: Description of the segment.
    * **`constraints`**: List of conditions that define the segment based on user properties.


#### Example
```yaml
namespace: production
flags:
- key: prod-flag
  # ... other flag configurations
segments:
- key: segment1
  # ... other segment configurations
```
