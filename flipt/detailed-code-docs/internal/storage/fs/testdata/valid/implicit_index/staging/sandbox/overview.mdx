## High-level description
This directory contains YAML configuration files for feature flags and segments in a sandbox environment. The files define feature flag configurations, including variants, rules, and rollouts, along with segment definitions and their matching criteria. These configurations are likely used for A/B testing, feature toggling, or gradual feature rollouts in a software application.

## What does it do?
The YAML files in this directory serve as a configuration system for managing feature flags and user segments in a sandbox environment. Here's a breakdown of what this configuration does:

1. Feature Flags: It defines various feature flags, each with properties like name, description, and enabled status. These flags can be used to turn specific features on or off in the application.

2. Variants: For each feature flag, it can define multiple variants. This allows for A/B testing or multivariate testing of different versions of a feature.

3. Rules and Rollouts: The configuration specifies rules for targeting feature flags to specific segments of users. It also defines rollout strategies, allowing for gradual release of features to increasing percentages of users.

4. Segments: It defines user segments based on specific criteria (like user properties or behaviors). These segments can be used to target feature flags to specific groups of users.

5. Targeting: The system allows for sophisticated targeting of features to users based on segment membership, allowing for personalized experiences or controlled feature releases.

This configuration system enables developers and product managers to control feature releases, conduct experiments, and personalize user experiences without needing to change the application code.

## Key Files

1. `features.yaml`:
   This file contains the main configuration for feature flags and segments. It defines:
   - The namespace for the flags and segments
   - A list of feature flags, each with:
     - A unique key
     - Name and description
     - Enabled status
     - Variants (different versions of the feature)
     - Rules for targeting specific segments
     - Rollout configurations
   - A list of segments, each with:
     - A unique key
     - Name
     - Match type
     - Constraints (criteria for segment membership)

2. `sandbox.features.yml`:
   This file appears to be an alternative or additional configuration file for feature flags and segments. It likely contains similar structure and content to `features.yaml`, possibly for a different set of features or for a specific sandbox environment.

3. `sandbox.yml`:
   This file is empty in the current configuration. It might be a placeholder for future sandbox-specific configurations or could be used to override or extend the configurations in the other files.

These files work together to provide a comprehensive configuration for feature management in the sandbox environment. The separation into multiple files allows for better organization and potentially different levels of configuration (e.g., global vs. sandbox-specific).

## Configuration
The configuration in this directory is primarily done through YAML files. Here are some key configurable fields and their meanings:

1. `namespace`: Defines the namespace for the flags and segments, helping to organize and isolate different sets of configurations.

2. `flags`: 
   - `key`: Unique identifier for the feature flag
   - `name`: Display name of the feature flag
   - `description`: Purpose of the feature flag
   - `enabled`: Whether the flag is globally enabled
   - `variants`: Different versions of the feature
   - `rules`: Targeting rules for the flag
   - `type`: Data type of the flag value
   - `rollouts`: Gradual rollout configurations

3. `segments`:
   - `key`: Unique identifier for the segment
   - `name`: Display name of the segment
   - `match_type`: How to apply multiple constraints (e.g., "any" or "all")
   - `constraints`: Criteria for segment membership

4. Rollout configurations:
   - `description`: Explanation of the rollout
   - `segment`: Target segment for the rollout
   - `threshold`: Percentage-based targeting
   - `percentage`: Percentage of users to target (0-100)

5. Constraint configurations:
   - `type`: Type of comparison
   - `property`: Property to compare
   - `operator`: Comparison operator
   - `value`: Value to compare against

These configurations allow for fine-grained control over feature releases and user targeting, enabling sophisticated feature management strategies.
