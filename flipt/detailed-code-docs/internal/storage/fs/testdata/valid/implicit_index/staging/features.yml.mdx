## High-level description
This YAML file defines feature flags and segments for a "staging" namespace. It specifies flag configurations, including variants, rules, and rollouts, along with segment definitions and their associated constraints.

## Code Structure
This YAML file represents data and does not contain code symbols. Therefore, the "Code Structure" section is not applicable.

## Symbols
This YAML file represents data and does not contain code symbols. Therefore, the "Symbols" section is not applicable.

## Dependencies
This YAML file represents data and does not have external dependencies. Therefore, the "Dependencies" section is not applicable.

## Configuration
This YAML file defines configuration for feature flags and segments within the "staging" namespace.

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| namespace | string | | The namespace for the defined flags and segments. |
| flags | list | | A list of feature flag configurations. |
| flags[].key | string | | The unique key identifier for the feature flag. |
| flags[].name | string | | The display name of the feature flag. |
| flags[].description | string | | A description of the feature flag's purpose. |
| flags[].enabled | boolean | | Indicates whether the feature flag is enabled globally. |
| flags[].variants | list | | A list of variants associated with the feature flag. |
| flags[].variants[].key | string | | The unique key identifier for the variant. |
| flags[].variants[].name | string | | The display name of the variant. |
| flags[].variants[].attachment | object | | An object containing arbitrary data associated with the variant. |
| flags[].rules | list | | A list of rules defining how the flag should be evaluated for different segments. |
| flags[].rules[].segment | string | | The key of the segment to which the rule applies. |
| flags[].rules[].rank | integer | | The priority of the rule (lower numbers have higher priority). |
| flags[].rules[].distributions | list | | A list of variant distributions for the rule. |
| flags[].rules[].distributions[].variant | string | | The key of the variant to distribute. |
| flags[].rules[].distributions[].rollout | integer | | The percentage rollout for the variant (0-100). |
| flags[].type | string | | The type of the feature flag (e.g., "BOOLEAN_FLAG_TYPE"). |
| flags[].rollouts | list | | A list of rollout configurations for the flag. |
| flags[].rollouts[].description | string | | A description of the rollout. |
| flags[].rollouts[].segment | object | | The segment to which the rollout applies. |
| flags[].rollouts[].segment.key | string | | The key of the segment. |
| flags[].rollouts[].segment.value | boolean | | Indicates whether the rollout is enabled for the segment. |
| flags[].rollouts[].threshold | object | | The threshold-based rollout configuration. |
| flags[].rollouts[].threshold.percentage | integer | | The percentage threshold for the rollout (0-100). |
| flags[].rollouts[].threshold.value | boolean | | Indicates whether the rollout is enabled for users above the threshold. |
| segments | list | | A list of segment definitions. |
| segments[].key | string | | The unique key identifier for the segment. |
| segments[].name | string | | The display name of the segment. |
| segments[].match_type | string | | The matching type for the segment (e.g., "ANY_MATCH_TYPE"). |
| segments[].description | string | | A description of the segment. |
| segments[].constraints | list | | A list of constraints defining the segment's membership criteria. |
| segments[].constraints[].type | string | | The type of constraint (e.g., "STRING_COMPARISON_TYPE"). |
| segments[].constraints[].property | string | | The property to evaluate for the constraint. |
| segments[].constraints[].operator | string | | The comparison operator for the constraint (e.g., "eq", "neq"). |
| segments[].constraints[].value | string | | The value to compare against for the constraint. |
| segments[].constraints[].description | string | | A description of the constraint. |

## Error Handling
This YAML file represents data and does not contain error handling mechanisms. Therefore, the "Error Handling" section is not applicable.

## Logging
This YAML file represents data and does not contain logging mechanisms. Therefore, the "Logging" section is not applicable.

## API/Interface Reference
This YAML file represents data and does not expose an API or interface. Therefore, the "API/Interface Reference" section is not applicable.
