title: "staging.features.yaml"
---

## High-level description
This YAML file defines feature flags and segments for a "staging" namespace. It includes details like flag names, descriptions, variants, rules, and segment definitions with constraints. This file is likely used for managing and configuring feature toggles in a staging environment.

## Code Structure
This YAML file represents data, not code, and is structured as a configuration file. It defines a `namespace`, `flags` (with their variants, rules, and rollouts), and `segments` (with their constraints).

## Symbols
This file does not contain code symbols like functions or classes. It defines data structures for feature flags and segments.

### `namespace`
