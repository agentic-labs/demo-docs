## High-level description
The code defines two feature flag configurations in YAML stream format, one for the "fruit" namespace and one for the "football" namespace. Each configuration includes flags, variants, rules, and segments.

## Code Structure
The file uses YAML stream syntax to define multiple documents, each representing a feature flag configuration. Each configuration is organized into "namespace", "flags", and "segments" sections. The "flags" section contains a list of flags, each with its own "variants" and "rules".
