title: "exclude.features.yml"
---

## High-level description
This file defines test cases for the "exclude" feature within a namespace using the Gherkin syntax. These tests likely verify the functionality of excluding specific files or directories during some operation, potentially related to file system storage. 

## Code Structure
This file doesn't contain code in a traditional programming language. It uses the Gherkin language to define test cases in a human-readable format. Each scenario outlines steps with keywords like "Given," "When," and "Then" to describe the test setup, actions, and expected outcomes.

## Symbols
This file does not define any symbols in the traditional programming sense. It uses Gherkin keywords to structure test scenarios. 

## Dependencies
This file likely depends on a testing framework that understands the Gherkin syntax and can execute the defined scenarios. The specific framework is not evident from this file alone.

## Configuration
This file does not contain explicit configuration options. The test scenarios themselves might implicitly rely on configuration settings managed by the testing framework or the system under test.
