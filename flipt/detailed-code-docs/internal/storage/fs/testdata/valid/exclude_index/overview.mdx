## High-level description
This directory contains test data for the Flipt tool, specifically focusing on the functionality of including and excluding files when searching for feature flag definitions. The directory is part of a larger structure related to file system storage testing within the Flipt project.

## What does it do?
This directory serves as a test case for the Flipt tool's file inclusion and exclusion capabilities. It demonstrates how Flipt can be configured to selectively process certain files while ignoring others based on specified patterns. This is particularly useful when managing feature flags across multiple files in a project.

The configuration file (.flipt.yml) sets up rules to include all files ending with ".features.yml" except for a specific file named "exclude.features.yml". This setup allows testers to verify that Flipt correctly applies these rules when scanning for feature flag definitions.

The included test files (exclude.features.yml and include.features.yml) contain Gherkin-style test scenarios. While the specific contents of these scenarios are not provided, they are likely designed to verify the behavior of the include/exclude functionality in various situations.

## Key Files
1. `.flipt.yml`: This is the configuration file for Flipt. It specifies which files should be included or excluded when Flipt searches for feature flag definitions. The configuration is set to include all files ending with ".features.yml" but explicitly excludes "exclude.features.yml".

   ```yaml
   version: "1.0"
   include:
     - "*.features.yml"
   exclude:
     - "exclude.features.yml"
   ```

2. `exclude.features.yml`: This file contains Gherkin-style test scenarios for the "exclude" feature. While the specific contents are not provided, it likely includes test cases to verify that files matching the exclude pattern are correctly ignored by Flipt.

3. `include.features.yml`: Similar to the exclude file, this contains Gherkin-style test scenarios for the "include" feature. It probably contains test cases to ensure that files matching the include pattern are correctly processed by Flipt.

## Configuration
The primary configuration in this directory is contained in the `.flipt.yml` file. Here's a breakdown of its contents:

| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| `version` | string | Specifies the version of the Flipt configuration format, set to "1.0". |
| `include` | list | Defines patterns for files to be included. In this case, it's set to `["*.features.yml"]`, meaning all files ending with ".features.yml" should be included. |
| `exclude` | list | Specifies patterns for files to be excluded. Here, it's set to `["exclude.features.yml"]`, meaning this specific file should be excluded even if it matches the include pattern. |

This configuration allows Flipt to selectively process files, including all ".features.yml" files except for "exclude.features.yml". This setup is crucial for testing Flipt's file handling capabilities and ensuring it correctly applies include/exclude rules.

The presence of both include and exclude patterns in this test data allows for comprehensive testing of Flipt's file selection logic, ensuring it can handle complex file inclusion/exclusion scenarios correctly.
