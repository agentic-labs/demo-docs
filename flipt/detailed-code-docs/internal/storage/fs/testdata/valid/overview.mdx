## High-level description
This directory contains test data for the Flipt feature flag management system, specifically focusing on various configuration scenarios and file structures. It includes subdirectories that demonstrate different aspects of Flipt's configuration capabilities, such as file inclusion/exclusion, explicit and implicit indexing, and YAML stream formatting.

## What does it do?
This directory serves as a comprehensive test suite for Flipt's file-based storage and configuration parsing capabilities. It simulates real-world scenarios that Flipt might encounter when managing feature flags across different environments and file structures. The test data covers:

1. File inclusion and exclusion patterns for selective processing of configuration files.
2. Explicit and implicit indexing of feature flag definitions across multiple files and directories.
3. Environment-specific configurations (production, sandbox, staging).
4. Various feature flag types (boolean, string, number) with different targeting rules and rollout strategies.
5. User segment definitions for targeted feature releases.
6. YAML stream format for defining multiple configurations in a single file.

These test cases allow developers to verify that Flipt correctly handles different configuration structures, properly applies include/exclude rules, and accurately parses and interprets feature flag and segment definitions across various formats and environments.

## Key Files
1. `exclude_index/.flipt.yml`: Demonstrates Flipt's file inclusion/exclusion capabilities.
2. `explicit_index/.flipt.yml`: Shows explicit indexing of feature flag files.
3. `explicit_index/prod/prod.features.yml`: Contains production environment feature flag configurations.
4. `explicit_index/sandbox/sandbox.features.yaml`: Includes sandbox environment feature flag configurations.
5. `implicit_index/prod/features.yml` and `implicit_index/staging/features.yml`: Demonstrate implicit indexing and environment-specific configurations.
6. `yaml_stream/flags.yaml`: Showcases YAML stream format for multiple configurations in a single file.

## Configuration
The configuration files in this directory use YAML format and include the following key elements:

1. Global Configuration (in `.flipt.yml` files):
   - `version`: Specifies the configuration file format version.
   - `include`: Glob patterns for files to include.
   - `exclude`: Glob patterns for files to exclude.

2. Feature Flag Configuration:
   - `namespace`: Specifies the environment (e.g., "prod", "sandbox", "staging").
   - `flags`: Defines feature flags with properties such as name, type, description, enabled status, variants, rules, and rollout strategies.
   - `segments`: Defines user groups with criteria for segment membership.

Example of a feature flag configuration:

```yaml
flags:
  new-onboarding:
    type: boolean
    defaultVariant: "false"
    variants:
      "true": true
      "false": false
    rules:
      - name: Enable for internal users
        variants:
          "true": 100
        constraints:
          - attribute: email
            operator: ends_with
            value: "@company.com"
```

This structure allows for flexible and powerful feature flag management across different environments, enabling sophisticated release strategies and user targeting. The test data in this directory ensures that Flipt can handle a wide range of configuration scenarios, from simple boolean flags to complex multi-variant flags with gradual rollout strategies and user segmentation.
