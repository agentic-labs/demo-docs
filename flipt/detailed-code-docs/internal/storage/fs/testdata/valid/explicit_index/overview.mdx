## High-level description
This directory contains configuration files for a feature flag management system, likely Flipt. It includes configurations for different environments (production and sandbox) and a global configuration file that specifies which feature flag definition files to include or exclude.

## What does it do?
This directory serves as a testbed for validating feature flag configurations across different environments. It allows developers and product managers to define, test, and manage feature flags, user segments, and rollout strategies. The configuration files enable:

1. Definition of feature flags with various types (boolean, string, number) and their default behaviors.
2. Creation of rules and constraints for activating features based on user attributes or other conditions.
3. Specification of gradual rollout strategies for features.
4. Definition of user segments based on specific criteria for targeted feature releases.
5. Separation of configurations for different environments (production and sandbox).
6. Global control over which configuration files are included or excluded in the feature flag system.

## Key Files

1. `.flipt.yml`: This is the global configuration file for the Flipt CLI. It specifies which files to include or exclude when loading feature flag definitions. Key points:
   - Includes all files ending with `.features.yaml` or `.features.yml` in any subdirectory.
   - Excludes files named `staging.features.yml` in any subdirectory.

2. `prod/prod.features.yml`: This file contains the production environment configurations. It defines:
   - Feature flags with their variants, rules, and rollouts.
   - User segments based on specific criteria.

   Example of a feature flag in production:

   ```yaml
   flags:
     new-onboarding:
       type: boolean
       defaultVariant: "false"
       variants:
         "true": true
         "false": false
       rules:
         - name: Enable for internal users
           variants:
             "true": 100
           constraints:
             - attribute: email
               operator: ends_with
               value: "@company.com"
   ```

3. `sandbox/sandbox.features.yaml`: This file contains the sandbox environment configurations. It includes:
   - More complex feature flag definitions with various types and rollout strategies.
   - Segment definitions for user targeting.

   Example of a feature flag in sandbox:

   ```yaml
   - name: bool_flag
     kind: boolean
     description: this is a bool flag
     enabled: false
     tags:
       - team:backend
     defaultServe:
       variation: "true"
     rules:
       - name: rule1
         serve:
           variation: "false"
         constraints:
           - property: country
             operator: in
             values:
               - JP
     variations:
       - "true"
       - "false"
   ```

## Configuration
The configuration files use YAML format and include the following key elements:

1. Namespace: Specifies the environment (e.g., "prod" or "sandbox").

2. Flags: Define feature flags with properties such as:
   - `name` or `kind`: Identifier and type of the flag.
   - `description`: Purpose of the flag.
   - `enabled`: Global on/off switch.
   - `variants` or `variations`: Possible values for the flag.
   - `defaultServe` or `defaultVariant`: Default behavior.
   - `rules`: Conditions for flag activation.
   - `rollout`: Gradual distribution strategies.

3. Segments: Define user groups with properties:
   - `name`: Identifier for the segment.
   - `description`: Purpose of the segment.
   - `match` or `constraints`: Criteria for segment membership.

4. Global Configuration (in `.flipt.yml`):
   - `version`: Specifies the configuration file format version.
   - `include`: Glob patterns for files to include.
   - `exclude`: Glob patterns for files to exclude.

This structure allows for flexible and powerful feature flag management across different environments, enabling sophisticated release strategies and user targeting.
