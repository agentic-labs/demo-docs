## High-level description
This directory contains YAML configuration files for feature flags and segments within a sandbox namespace. The primary file in this directory is `sandbox.features.yaml`, which defines various feature flags, their configurations, and associated segments for user targeting.

## What does it do?
The `sandbox.features.yaml` file serves as a configuration for a feature flagging system. It defines:

1. Feature flags: These are toggles that can be used to enable or disable specific features in an application.
2. Variants: Different versions or options for a feature that can be selectively rolled out.
3. Rules: Conditions that determine when and for whom a feature should be enabled.
4. Rollouts: Gradual release strategies for features, often based on percentages.
5. Segments: Groups of users defined by specific criteria, used for targeting features to particular audiences.

This configuration allows developers and product managers to control the release and availability of features in their application, enabling practices like A/B testing, gradual rollouts, and targeted feature releases.

## Key Files
1. `sandbox.features.yaml`: This is the main configuration file in the directory. It contains all the feature flag and segment definitions for the sandbox namespace.

2. `features.yaml` and `sandbox.yml`: These files are present in the directory but are empty. They might be placeholder files or used in other contexts not evident from the provided information.

## Configuration
The `sandbox.features.yaml` file is the primary configuration file. It uses YAML format to define the following key elements:

1. Namespace: The configuration is for a namespace called "sandbox".

2. Feature Flags: Each feature flag is defined with various properties:
   - `name`: A unique identifier for the flag
   - `kind`: The type of the flag (e.g., "boolean", "string")
   - `description`: A human-readable description of the flag's purpose
   - `enabled`: Whether the flag is globally enabled or disabled
   - `variants`: Different versions or options for the feature
   - `defaultServe`: The default behavior when no rules match
   - `rules`: Conditions for serving specific variants
   - `tags`: Labels for organizing and categorizing flags

3. Segments: User groups defined by specific criteria:
   - `name`: A unique identifier for the segment
   - `description`: A human-readable description of the segment
   - `constraints`: Rules for determining segment membership

Here's an example of a feature flag configuration from the file:

```yaml
- name: bool_flag
  kind: boolean
  description: this is a bool flag
  enabled: false
  tags:
    - team:backend
  defaultServe:
    variation: "true"
  rules:
    - name: rule1
      serve:
        variation: "false"
      constraints:
        - property: country
          operator: in
          values:
            - JP
  variations:
    - "true"
    - "false"
```

This configuration defines a boolean flag named "bool_flag" that is globally disabled but can be enabled for specific users based on rules. The default serve is "true", but there's a rule that serves "false" for users in Japan.

The file also includes more complex configurations for string flags, number flags, and flags with multiple variants and complex rollout strategies.

Segments are defined similarly, with constraints that determine membership. For example:

```yaml
- name: segment1
  description: this is segment 1
  constraints:
    - property: country
      operator: in
      values:
        - US
        - SG
```

This segment includes users from the United States and Singapore.

The configuration in this file allows for fine-grained control over feature releases and user targeting, enabling sophisticated feature management strategies.
