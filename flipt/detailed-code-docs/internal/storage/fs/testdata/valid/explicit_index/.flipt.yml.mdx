## High-level description
This YAML file defines the configuration for Flipt feature flag management system. It specifies which feature flag definition files to include and exclude from processing.

## Symbols
### `.flipt.yml`
#### Description
This YAML file configures the Flipt CLI's behavior for loading feature flag definitions. It uses glob patterns to include and exclude specific files.

#### Internal Logic
* **`version`**: Specifies the version of the Flipt configuration file format.
* **`include`**: Defines a list of glob patterns for files to include as feature flag definitions. 
    * `**/*.features.yaml`: Includes all files ending with ".features.yaml" in any subdirectory.
    * `**/*.features.yml`: Includes all files ending with ".features.yml" in any subdirectory.
* **`exclude`**: Defines a list of glob patterns for files to exclude from feature flag definitions.
    * `**/staging.features.yml`: Excludes all files named "staging.features.yml" in any subdirectory.

This configuration ensures that all feature flag definitions ending in ".features.yaml" or ".features.yml" are loaded, except for those named "staging.features.yml". This suggests a separation of staging and production feature flag configurations.
