## High-level description
This directory contains configuration files for feature flags and segments in a production environment. The main file, `prod.features.yml`, defines the feature flags, their variants, rules, and rollouts, as well as user segments based on specific criteria. The directory is part of a larger system that likely manages feature flags and user segmentation for a software application.

## What does it do?
The configuration in this directory allows developers and product managers to control the rollout of features in their application. It defines:

1. Feature flags: These are toggles that can be used to enable or disable specific features of an application. Each flag can have multiple variants, allowing for A/B testing or gradual rollouts.

2. Rules: These determine when and for whom a feature flag is activated. Rules can be based on user attributes or other conditions.

3. Rollouts: These specify how a feature should be gradually introduced to users, often using percentage-based distribution.

4. Segments: These are groups of users defined by specific criteria, such as their attributes or behaviors. Segments can be used in rules to target features to specific user groups.

By using this configuration, the application can dynamically adjust its behavior based on the defined flags and segments, allowing for controlled feature releases, experimentation, and personalized user experiences.

## Key Files
1. `prod.features.yml`: This is the main configuration file in the directory. It contains the following key sections:

   - `namespace`: Specifies the environment (in this case, "prod" for production).
   - `flags`: Defines individual feature flags, their variants, rules, and rollouts.
   - `segments`: Defines user segments based on specific criteria and constraints.

   Example of a feature flag definition:

   ```yaml
   flags:
     new-onboarding:
       type: boolean
       defaultVariant: "false"
       variants:
         "true": true
         "false": false
       rules:
         - name: Enable for internal users
           variants:
             "true": 100
           constraints:
             - attribute: email
               operator: ends_with
               value: "@company.com"
   ```

   This example defines a boolean flag named "new-onboarding" with a default value of false. It has a rule that enables the feature for all users with a company email address.

   Example of a segment definition:

   ```yaml
   segments:
     beta-users:
       match: any
       constraints:
         - attribute: beta_user
           operator: "="
           value: "true"
         - attribute: email
           operator: ends_with
           value: "@beta.company.com"
   ```

   This segment defines "beta-users" as those who either have a `beta_user` attribute set to true or have an email ending with "@beta.company.com".

The other files in the directory (`features.yml` and `prod.yml`) are empty, suggesting they might be placeholders for future use or alternative configurations.

## Configuration
The `prod.features.yml` file serves as the main configuration for the feature flag system. It uses a YAML format and includes the following configurable fields:

1. `namespace`: Specifies the environment (e.g., "prod" for production).

2. `flags`: Defines feature flags with the following properties:
   - `type`: The data type of the flag (e.g., boolean, string).
   - `defaultVariant`: The default value of the flag.
   - `variants`: Possible values for the flag.
   - `rules`: Conditions for flag activation, including:
     - `name`: A descriptive name for the rule.
     - `variants`: The flag values to use when the rule is met.
     - `constraints`: Conditions that must be satisfied for the rule to apply.
   - `rollout`: Gradual distribution of flag variants.

3. `segments`: Defines user segments with the following properties:
   - `match`: Specifies how constraints should be combined (e.g., "any" for OR, "all" for AND).
   - `constraints`: Conditions that define the segment, including:
     - `attribute`: The user attribute to check.
     - `operator`: The comparison operator (e.g., "=", "ends_with").
     - `value`: The value to compare against.

This configuration allows for fine-grained control over feature releases and user targeting, enabling sophisticated feature management strategies in the production environment.
