## High-level description
This YAML file defines feature flags and segments for a hypothetical "fruit" namespace. It appears to contain invalid data, specifically an unknown segment key within a rollout. This file is likely used for testing purposes to ensure the system correctly handles invalid configurations.

## Code Structure
This file represents data, not code, and its structure is straightforward. It defines a namespace "fruit", and within that namespace, it lists feature flags and segments. Each flag and segment has a key, name, and other attributes depending on its type.

## Symbols
### `fruit`
#### Description
This string defines the namespace for the features and segments defined in the file.

### `flags`
#### Description
This section lists the feature flags defined within the "fruit" namespace.

### `apple`
#### Description
This is the key for a feature flag named "Apple". It's defined as a BOOLEAN_FLAG_TYPE, indicating it can be either true or false.

#### Internal Logic
The flag defines a rollout with a segment key "unknown". This is likely the source of the invalid configuration as there's no segment defined with that key.

### `segments`
#### Description
This section lists the segments defined within the "fruit" namespace.

### `internal`
#### Description
This is the key for a segment named "Internal". It's defined with the ANY_MATCH_TYPE, meaning any user would be considered part of this segment.
