## High-level description
This file is a YAML configuration file named `.flipt.yml` located in a test directory. It defines a Flipt configuration version and includes a file named `features.unknown`. The presence of this file in a directory named "invalid" and "extension" suggests that it's used for testing invalid file extensions or include paths in Flipt.

## Code Structure
This file is a simple YAML configuration with two fields: `version` and `include`. 

## Symbols
### `.flipt.yml`
#### Description
This YAML file defines a Flipt configuration. It specifies the configuration version and includes another file.

#### Internal Logic
- **version**: Sets the configuration version to "1.0".
- **include**: Includes a file named `features.unknown`. The actual content or purpose of this file is unknown based on this file alone. However, the directory structure suggests it might contain feature flag definitions. The "invalid/extension" path implies that this configuration is used to test scenarios where the included file has an unsupported extension or is located in an invalid directory.
