## High-level description
This YAML file defines feature flags and segments for a hypothetical "fruit" namespace. It seems intended for testing and validation purposes, specifically showcasing an invalid configuration where a variant flag distribution is incorrectly defined. 

## Code Structure
The file defines a `namespace`, `flags`, and `segments`. The `flags` section contains a list of feature flags, each with its own `key`, `name`, `variants`, and `rules`. The `rules` section defines how the flag should be evaluated for different segments, including the distribution of variants within a segment. The `segments` section defines the segments used in the `rules`.

## Symbols
### `fruit`
#### Description
This string defines the namespace for the feature flags and segments defined in the file. Namespaces are used to group related flags and segments together.

### `flags`
#### Description
This section defines a list of feature flags. Each flag is defined by a dictionary with the following keys:

* `key`: The unique identifier of the flag.
* `name`: A human-readable name for the flag.
* `variants`: A list of variants for the flag.
* `rules`: A list of rules that define how the flag should be evaluated for different segments.

### `apple`
#### Description
This dictionary defines a feature flag named "Apple" with two variants: "royal-gala" and "pink-lady". The `rules` section attempts to define a variant distribution for the "braeburn" variant, which is invalid as "braeburn" is not defined as a variant for this flag.

### `segments`
#### Description
This section defines a list of segments. Each segment is defined by a dictionary with the following keys:

* `key`: The unique identifier of the segment.
* `name`: A human-readable name for the segment.
* `match_type`: The type of matching to use for the segment.

### `internal`
#### Description
This dictionary defines a segment named "Internal" with an `ANY_MATCH_TYPE` match type. This means that any user will be considered part of this segment.

## Error Handling
This file does not implement any error handling. It is intended to be used for testing and validation purposes, and any errors in the configuration will be caught by the system that consumes this file.
