## High-level description
This directory contains test data for invalid configurations in the Flipt feature flag evaluation system. It includes various YAML and JSON files that simulate different types of configuration errors, such as invalid data types, unknown segments, and incorrect variant distributions. The purpose of this directory is to test how the Flipt system handles and reports these invalid configurations, ensuring robust error handling and validation processes.

## What does it do?
This directory simulates various invalid configuration scenarios for the Flipt feature flag evaluation system. It does this by providing:

1. A YAML file with an invalid boolean flag segment configuration.
2. A YAML configuration file that includes a file with an unknown extension.
3. A JSON file with an invalid namespace definition (using an integer instead of a string).
4. A YAML file with an invalid variant flag distribution.
5. A YAML file with an invalid variant flag segment configuration.

These files allow developers to test the system's error handling and validation processes when encountering various types of configuration errors. This helps ensure that the Flipt system can gracefully handle and report such errors, improving the overall robustness and reliability of the feature flag management process.

## Key Files

1. `boolean_flag_segment`: A YAML file defining feature flags and segments with an unknown segment key within a rollout.

2. `extension/.flipt.yml`: A YAML configuration file that includes a file with an unknown extension (`features.unknown`).

3. `namespace/.flipt.yml` and `namespace/features.json`: A YAML configuration file that includes a JSON file with an invalid namespace definition (integer instead of string).

4. `variant_flag_distribution`: A YAML file defining feature flags and segments with an incorrectly defined variant flag distribution.

5. `variant_flag_segment`: A YAML file defining feature flags and segments with an invalid configuration where a variant flag is assigned to an undefined segment.

## Configuration
The configurations in this directory are intentionally invalid to test error handling. The key configurable fields across the files include:

1. `namespace`: Defines the namespace for feature flags and segments (incorrectly set to an integer in one case).
2. `flags`: Defines feature flags with keys, names, variants, and rules.
3. `segments`: Defines user segments with keys, names, and match types.
4. `version`: Specifies the version of the Flipt configuration format (in `.flipt.yml` files).
5. `include`: Lists external files to be included in the configuration (in `.flipt.yml` files).

These invalid configurations are designed to trigger various error handling mechanisms in the Flipt system, allowing developers to verify that the system correctly identifies and reports different types of configuration errors. This test data plays a crucial role in ensuring the robustness of the Flipt system by verifying its ability to handle and report configuration errors effectively across various scenarios.
