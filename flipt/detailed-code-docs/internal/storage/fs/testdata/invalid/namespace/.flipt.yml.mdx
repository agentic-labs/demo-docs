## High-level description
This YAML file defines a Flipt evaluation namespace configuration. It specifies the version of the configuration format and includes an external JSON file ("features.json") that likely contains feature flag definitions. 

## Symbols
There are no symbols (functions, classes, etc.) in this code as it is a YAML configuration file.

## Dependencies
This configuration file implicitly depends on the Flipt platform and its conventions for namespace configuration.

| include | list |  | A list of file paths to include in the configuration. This allows for modularity and organization of feature flag definitions. | 

## Error Handling
