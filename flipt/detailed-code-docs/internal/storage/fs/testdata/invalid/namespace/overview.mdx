## High-level description
This directory contains test data for an invalid namespace configuration in the Flipt evaluation system. It consists of two files: a YAML configuration file and a JSON file with feature flag definitions. The purpose of this directory is to test how the Flipt system handles invalid configurations, specifically an incorrect data type for the namespace field.

## What does it do?
This directory simulates an invalid configuration scenario for the Flipt feature flag evaluation system. It does this by:

1. Providing a valid YAML configuration file that includes an external JSON file.
2. Including a JSON file with an invalid namespace definition (using an integer instead of a string).

This setup allows developers to test the system's error handling and validation processes when encountering incorrect data types in crucial fields like the namespace. It helps ensure that the Flipt system can gracefully handle and report such configuration errors, improving the overall robustness and reliability of the feature flag management process.

## Key Files

1. `.flipt.yml`
   This file contains the main configuration for the Flipt namespace. It specifies the version of the configuration format and includes an external JSON file for feature flag definitions.

   ```yaml
   version: "1.0"
   include:
     - features.json
   ```

   The file uses version "1.0" of the configuration format and includes the "features.json" file, which contains the actual feature flag definitions.

2. `features.json`
   This JSON file contains an intentionally invalid feature set definition. It defines a namespace using an incorrect data type:

   ```json
   {"namespace": 1}
   ```

   The `namespace` field is set to an integer value (1) instead of the expected string type. This invalidity is deliberate and is used to test how the Flipt system handles and reports such errors during configuration parsing and validation.

## Configuration
The configuration in this directory is intentionally invalid to test error handling. The key configurable fields are:

1. In `.flipt.yml`:
   - `version`: Specifies the version of the Flipt configuration format being used (set to "1.0").
   - `include`: Lists external files to be included in the configuration (includes "features.json").

2. In `features.json`:
   - `namespace`: Should be a string identifying the namespace, but is incorrectly set to an integer (1) for testing purposes.

The invalid configuration in `features.json` is designed to trigger error handling mechanisms in the Flipt system, allowing developers to verify that the system correctly identifies and reports the use of an incorrect data type for the namespace field.

This test data plays a crucial role in ensuring the robustness of the Flipt system by verifying its ability to handle and report configuration errors effectively. It helps maintain the integrity of the feature flag evaluation process by catching potential issues early in the configuration parsing stage.
