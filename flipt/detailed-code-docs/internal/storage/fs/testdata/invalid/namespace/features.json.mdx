title: "features.json"
---

## High-level description
This file contains invalid test data representing a feature set in JSON format. The invalidity stems from the "namespace" field being an integer (1) instead of a string. This file is likely used to test the robustness of a system that parses and validates feature set data. 

## Code Structure
This file contains a single JSON object with one key-value pair.

## Symbols
### `{"namespace": 1}`
#### Description
This JSON object represents a feature set with an invalid namespace.

#### Internal Logic
The object uses the key "namespace" to store the namespace information. However, instead of a string, it contains the integer value `1`, which is invalid. This invalidity is likely intentional, designed to test how a system handles incorrect data types for the namespace field.
