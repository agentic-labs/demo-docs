## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for the `Snapshot` struct in the `fs` package. The tests cover various scenarios, including loading snapshots from different file systems, handling invalid data, and verifying the functionality of the `Snapshot` struct's methods.

## Code Structure
The file defines two test suites: `FSIndexSuite` and `FSWithoutIndexSuite`. Each suite tests the functionality of the `Snapshot` struct when loaded from a file system with and without an index file, respectively. The suites contain individual test functions for each method of the `Snapshot` struct.

## References
This file references the following code symbols:

* `SnapshotFromFS`: A function that creates a `Snapshot` from a file system.
* `WalkDocuments`: A function that walks all Flipt feature documents in a file system.
* `storage.ReadOnlyStore`: An interface that defines methods for reading data from a storage backend.
* `flipt.Flag`, `flipt.Segment`, `flipt.Namespace`, `flipt.Rule`, `flipt.Rollout`, `flipt.Distribution`, `flipt.Constraint`: Protobuf messages that represent Flipt entities.
* `storage.EvaluationRule`, `storage.EvaluationDistribution`, `storage.EvaluationRollout`: Structs that represent evaluation data for Flipt entities.

## Symbols

### `TestSnapshotFromFS_Invalid`
#### Description
This test function verifies that `SnapshotFromFS` returns an error when provided with invalid data.

#### Internal Logic
The test iterates over a list of test cases, each containing a path to a directory with invalid data and the expected error. For each test case, it:

1. **Arrange:** Loads the directory using `fs.Sub`.
2. **Act:** Calls `SnapshotFromFS` with the directory.
3. **Assert:** Verifies that the returned error matches the expected error.

### `TestWalkDocuments`
#### Description
This test function verifies that `WalkDocuments` correctly walks all Flipt feature documents in a file system.

#### Internal Logic
The test iterates over a list of test cases, each containing a path to a directory and the expected number of documents. For each test case, it:

1. **Arrange:** Loads the directory using `fs.Sub`.
2. **Act:** Calls `WalkDocuments` with the directory and a callback function that appends each document to a slice.
3. **Assert:** Verifies that the number of documents in the slice matches the expected count.

### `TestFSWithIndex`
#### Description
This test function sets up and runs the `FSIndexSuite` test suite.

#### Internal Logic
The test loads a directory containing an index file and creates a `Snapshot` from it using `SnapshotFromFS`. It then creates an instance of `FSIndexSuite` with the `Snapshot` and runs the suite using `suite.Run`.

### `FSIndexSuite`
#### Description
This test suite verifies the functionality of the `Snapshot` struct when loaded from a file system with an index file.

#### Internal Logic
The suite contains individual test functions for each method of the `Snapshot` struct, such as `TestCountFlag`, `TestGetFlag`, `TestListFlags`, etc. Each test function follows the arrange, act, and assert pattern to verify the expected behavior of the method.

### `TestFSWithoutIndex`
#### Description
This test function sets up and runs the `FSWithoutIndexSuite` test suite.

#### Internal Logic
The test loads a directory without an index file and creates a `Snapshot` from it using `SnapshotFromFS`. It then creates an instance of `FSWithoutIndexSuite` with the `Snapshot` and runs the suite using `suite.Run`.

### `FSWithoutIndexSuite`
#### Description
This test suite verifies the functionality of the `Snapshot` struct when loaded from a file system without an index file.

#### Internal Logic
The suite contains individual test functions for each method of the `Snapshot` struct, similar to `FSIndexSuite`. Each test function follows the arrange, act, and assert pattern to verify the expected behavior of the method.

### `TestFS_Empty_Features_File`
#### Description
This test function verifies that the `Snapshot` struct handles an empty features file gracefully.

#### Internal Logic
The test loads a directory with an empty features file and creates a `Snapshot` from it using `SnapshotFromFS`. It then calls various `List` methods on the `Snapshot` and verifies that they do not return an error.

### `TestFS_YAML_Stream`
#### Description
This test function verifies that the `Snapshot` struct can handle YAML streams with multiple documents.

#### Internal Logic
The test loads a directory with a YAML stream containing multiple documents and creates a `Snapshot` from it using `SnapshotFromFS`. It then verifies that the `Snapshot` correctly parses all namespaces, flags, and segments from the stream.
