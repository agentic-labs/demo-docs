## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of a read-only storage backend for Flipt feature flags, backed by an OCI (Open Container Initiative) repository. The main component is the `SnapshotStore` struct, which periodically polls an OCI repository for updates and maintains a snapshot of the feature flag data.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory provides a way to store and retrieve Flipt feature flags using an OCI repository as the underlying storage mechanism. Here's a simplified explanation of how it works:

1. The system connects to an OCI repository, which is like a special kind of container for storing data.
2. It regularly checks this repository for any changes to the feature flag data.
3. When it detects a change, it downloads the latest version of the data and creates a new "snapshot" of all the feature flags.
4. This snapshot is then made available for the rest of the Flipt system to use when it needs to check feature flag states.
5. The system ensures that reading from this snapshot is thread-safe, meaning multiple parts of the application can safely access the data at the same time.

This approach allows Flipt to use OCI repositories as a reliable and scalable way to store and distribute feature flag configurations across different environments or systems.

## Key Files

### store.go
This file contains the core implementation of the OCI-backed storage system. Key components include:

- `SnapshotStore` struct: The main structure that implements the read-only storage backend.
- `NewSnapshotStore` function: Creates and configures a new `SnapshotStore` instance.
- `View` method: Provides thread-safe read-only access to the latest snapshot of feature flag data.
- `update` method: Fetches the latest state from the OCI repository and updates the snapshot if necessary.

### store_test.go
This file contains unit tests for the `SnapshotStore` implementation. Key test cases include:

- `Test_SourceString`: Verifies the string representation of the `SnapshotStore`.
- `Test_SourceSubscribe`: Tests the subscription mechanism for detecting changes in the OCI repository.

It also includes several helper functions for setting up test environments and manipulating OCI repositories for testing purposes.

## Dependencies
The implementation relies on several external libraries and internal packages:

1. `github.com/opencontainers/go-digest`: Used for digest calculation and comparison.
2. `go.flipt.io/flipt/internal/containers`: Provides utility functions for working with containers.
3. `go.flipt.io/flipt/internal/oci`: Offers functions for interacting with OCI repositories.
4. `go.flipt.io/flipt/internal/storage`: Defines interfaces and types for Flipt storage backends.
5. `go.flipt.io/flipt/internal/storage/fs`: Implements file system-based storage backend.
6. `go.uber.org/zap`: Used for logging.

## Configuration
The `SnapshotStore` can be configured using the following options:

- `WithPollOptions`: Allows setting options for the embedded `storagefs.Poller`, which controls how often the OCI repository is checked for updates.

Example usage:
```go
store, err := NewSnapshotStore(ctx, logger, ociStore, ociRef,
    WithPollOptions(storagefs.WithPollInterval(time.Minute)))
```

This configuration would set the poll interval to one minute, meaning the store will check for updates in the OCI repository every minute.

The `SnapshotStore` also uses a logger instance (`zap.Logger`) for logging operations and errors. This logger is passed during the creation of the `SnapshotStore`.

## Error Handling
Error handling in this implementation is primarily done by returning errors to the caller. The `update` method, which is responsible for fetching and applying updates from the OCI repository, returns both a boolean indicating whether an update occurred and an error if any issues were encountered.

The `View` method, which provides read-only access to the snapshot, passes through any errors returned by the user-provided function.

Errors are logged using the provided `zap.Logger` instance, allowing for centralized error tracking and debugging.

In summary, this directory implements a crucial part of Flipt's storage system, enabling the use of OCI repositories as a backend for feature flag data. It provides a thread-safe, read-only interface to this data, with built-in mechanisms for keeping the local snapshot up-to-date with the remote repository.
