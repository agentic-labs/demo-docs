## High-level description
The code defines tests for the `ParseFliptIndex` function in the `fs` package. It ensures that the function correctly parses a Flipt index file and handles parsing errors gracefully.

## Symbols
### `TestParseFliptIndex`
#### Description
This test verifies the successful parsing of a Flipt index file. It creates a sample index file content, parses it using `ParseFliptIndex`, and asserts the expected values for includes, excludes, and matching behavior.

#### Inputs
N/A - This symbol is a test function and does not take explicit inputs.

#### Outputs
N/A - This symbol is a test function and does not return any explicit outputs.

#### Internal Logic
- **Arrange:** Defines a sample Flipt index file content as a byte buffer.
- **Act:** Calls the `ParseFliptIndex` function with the buffer.
- **Assert:**
    - Checks for no errors during parsing.
    - Verifies the number of included and excluded patterns.
    - Asserts the `Match` function's behavior against expected file paths.

### `TestParseFliptIndexParsingError`
#### Description
This test ensures that the `ParseFliptIndex` function handles parsing errors correctly. It attempts to parse an invalid index file and asserts that an error is returned.

#### Inputs
N/A - This symbol is a test function and does not take explicit inputs.

#### Outputs
N/A - This symbol is a test function and does not return any explicit outputs.

#### Internal Logic
- **Arrange:** Defines an invalid Flipt index file content.
- **Act:** Calls the `ParseFliptIndex` function with the invalid content.
- **Assert:**
    - Checks for an error during parsing.
    - Verifies the error message.
