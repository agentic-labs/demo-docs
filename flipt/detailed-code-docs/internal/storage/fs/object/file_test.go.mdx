## High-level description
The code defines a test suite for the `NewFile` function in the `object` package. It creates a new `File` object and verifies its properties, such as name, size, modification time, and content. It also checks the implementation of the `Stat`, `Read`, `Close`, and `Etag` methods.

## References
- `storagefs.EtagInfo`: This interface is referenced to check if the `FileInfo` object returned by `Stat` implements the `Etag` method.

## Symbols
### `TestNewFile`
#### Description
This function is a test function that verifies the behavior of the `NewFile` function. It creates a new `File` object with predefined content and metadata, then asserts that the object's properties and methods behave as expected.

#### Inputs
This function takes no inputs as it is a test function.

#### Outputs
This function has no outputs as it is a test function.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Arrange:**
    - Define a `modTime` representing a specific time.
    - Create a new `io.NopCloser` containing the string "hello".
    - Call `NewFile` with the name "f.txt", size 5, the reader `r`, `modTime`, and etag "hash" to create a new `File` object.
2. **Act:**
    - Call the `Stat` method on the `File` object to get its `FileInfo`.
    - Read the content of the `File` object into a buffer.
    - Close the `File` object.
3. **Assert:**
    - Verify that the `FileInfo` returned by `Stat` contains the expected name, size, and modification time.
    - Check that the content read from the `File` object matches the predefined string "hello".
    - Confirm that the `FileInfo` implements the `storagefs.EtagInfo` interface and its `Etag` method returns the expected value.

## Dependencies
- `github.com/stretchr/testify/require`: This library is used for assertions in the test function.
- `go.flipt.io/flipt/internal/storage/fs`: This package provides the `storagefs.EtagInfo` interface.
