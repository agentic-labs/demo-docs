## High-level description
This code defines unit tests for helper functions related to object storage schemes in the `fs` package. It specifically tests the `remapScheme` function which maps storage schemes to their internal representations and verifies the list of supported schemes.

## Code Structure
The code consists of two test functions, `TestRemapScheme` and `TestSupportedSchemes`, both using table-driven tests to verify the behavior of the corresponding helper functions.

## Symbols

### `TestRemapScheme`
#### Description
This function tests the `remapScheme` function, which is responsible for mapping storage schemes to their internal representations.

#### Inputs
This is a test function and does not take inputs.

#### Outputs
This is a test function and does not return outputs.

#### Internal Logic
The test iterates over a table of test cases, each containing an input scheme and the expected remapped scheme. For each case, it calls `remapScheme` with the input scheme and asserts that the returned value matches the expected remapped scheme using the `assert.Equal` function.

### `TestSupportedSchemes`
#### Description
This function tests the `SupportedSchemes` function, which returns a list of supported storage schemes.

#### Inputs
This is a test function and does not take inputs.

#### Outputs
This is a test function and does not return outputs.

#### Internal Logic
The test iterates over a list of supported schemes. For each scheme, it calls `SupportedSchemes` and asserts that the returned list contains the current scheme using the `assert.Contains` function.
