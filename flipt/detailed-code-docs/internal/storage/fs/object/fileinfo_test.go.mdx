title: "fileinfo_test.go"

## High-level description
The code defines a test suite for the `FileInfo` struct within the `object` package. It includes tests to verify the behavior of various methods like `Type()`, `Name()`, `Size()`, `ModTime()`, `IsDir()`, `Info()`, `Sys()`, and `etag`.

## Code Structure
The code consists of two test functions, `TestFileInfo` and `TestFileInfoIsDir`, both of which test different aspects of the `FileInfo` struct. 

## Symbols

### `TestFileInfo`
#### Description
This function tests the behavior of various methods of the `FileInfo` struct, ensuring they return the expected values.

#### Inputs
This function takes a testing.T pointer as input, which is used for error reporting and logging during the test.

#### Outputs
This function does not return any values.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Arrange:** It creates a new `FileInfo` object with pre-defined values for name, size, modification time, directory flag, and etag.
2. **Act:** It calls various methods of the `FileInfo` object and stores the returned values.
3. **Assert:** It uses the `require` package to assert that the returned values match the expected values. For example, it checks if the `Name()` method returns the correct file name, the `Size()` method returns the correct file size, and so on.

### `TestFileInfoIsDir`
#### Description
This function specifically tests the `IsDir()` method of the `FileInfo` struct after setting the directory flag to true.

#### Inputs
This function takes a testing.T pointer as input, which is used for error reporting and logging during the test.

#### Outputs
This function does not return any values.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Arrange:** It creates a new `FileInfo` object.
2. **Act:** It calls the `SetDir()` method with `true` to mark the `FileInfo` object as a directory.
3. **Assert:** It uses the `require` package to assert that the `IsDir()` method returns `true`, indicating the object is correctly identified as a directory.
