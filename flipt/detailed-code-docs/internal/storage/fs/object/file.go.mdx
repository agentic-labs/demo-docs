## High-level description
The `File` struct in `file.go` implements the `fs.File` interface, providing a way to interact with objects in a storage system as if they were regular files. It represents an open file, holding metadata like key, length, modification time, and ETag, along with a reader for the file's content.

## Code Structure
The `File` struct implements the `fs.File` interface by providing `Stat`, `Read`, and `Close` methods. The `NewFile` function acts as a constructor for creating new `File` instances.

## Symbols

### Symbol Name: `File`
#### Description
The `File` struct represents an open file in the storage system. It holds metadata about the file and provides methods to interact with its content.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a struct definition, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a struct definition, not a function.

#### Internal Logic
The `File` struct embeds the file's key, length, a reader for its content (`body`), modification time, and ETag.

### Symbol Name: `Stat`
#### Description
This method implements the `Stat` method of the `fs.File` interface. It returns a `FileInfo` struct containing metadata about the file.

#### Inputs
N/A

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| fs.FileInfo | `fs.FileInfo` | A struct containing file metadata (name, size, modification time, ETag). |
| error | `error` | An error object if the operation fails. |

#### Internal Logic
The method constructs a `FileInfo` struct using the file's metadata and returns it.

### Symbol Name: `Read`
#### Description
This method implements the `Read` method of the `fs.File` interface. It reads up to `len(p)` bytes from the file into `p`.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| p | `[]byte` | A byte slice to read the data into. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| n | `int` | The number of bytes read. |
| err | `error` | An error object if the operation fails. |

#### Internal Logic
The method delegates the read operation to the underlying `io.ReadCloser` (`body`) of the file.

### Symbol Name: `Close`
#### Description
This method implements the `Close` method of the `fs.File` interface. It closes the file, releasing any resources associated with it.

#### Inputs
N/A

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| error | `error` | An error object if the operation fails. |

#### Internal Logic
The method closes the underlying `io.ReadCloser` (`body`) of the file.

### Symbol Name: `NewFile`
#### Description
This function acts as a constructor for the `File` struct. It creates and initializes a new `File` instance with the provided parameters.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| key | `string` | The key of the file in the storage system. |
| length | `int64` | The length of the file in bytes. |
| body | `io.ReadCloser` | An `io.ReadCloser` representing the file's content. |
| modTime | `time.Time` | The modification time of the file. |
| etag | `string` | The ETag of the file. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| *File | `*File` | A pointer to the newly created `File` instance. |

#### Internal Logic
The function creates a new `File` instance and initializes its fields with the provided values.
