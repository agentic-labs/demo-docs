## High-level description
The `internal/storage/fs/object` directory contains code for implementing a snapshot store that interacts with object storage services like AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, and Google Cloud Storage. It provides functionality to retrieve, manage, and update snapshots of configuration data stored in these cloud storage services.

## What does it do?
This package implements a `SnapshotStore` that:
1. Connects to various cloud object storage services using a unified API provided by the `gocloud.dev/blob` package.
2. Retrieves configuration data snapshots from the storage service.
3. Periodically polls the storage for changes and updates its internal snapshot.
4. Provides a read-only view of the current snapshot for other parts of the application to use.
5. Supports organizing objects within a bucket using prefixes.
6. Handles different storage schemes (e.g., S3, Azure Blob, Google Cloud Storage) through URL-based configuration.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this package is the `NewSnapshotStore` function in `store.go`. This function initializes a new `SnapshotStore` with the provided configuration, fetches the initial snapshot, and starts a background process to poll for updates.

The `OpenBucket` function in `mux.go` is another important entry point, used to open a connection to a specific bucket in the object storage service based on a provided URL.

## Key Files
1. `store.go`: Implements the core `SnapshotStore` functionality, including snapshot retrieval, updating, and providing read-only access.
2. `mux.go`: Provides URL-based bucket opening functionality, supporting various cloud storage providers.
3. `file.go` and `fileinfo.go`: Implement file and file information structures used to represent objects in the storage system.

## Dependencies
The package relies on several external libraries:
1. `gocloud.dev/blob`: Provides a unified API for interacting with various cloud storage services.
2. `github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/service/s3`: Used for S3-specific functionality.
3. `go.uber.org/zap`: Used for logging.
4. `go.flipt.io/flipt/internal/storage`: Defines interfaces for storage backends.
5. `go.flipt.io/flipt/internal/storage/fs`: Provides common filesystem-based storage functionality.

## Configuration
The `SnapshotStore` can be configured with:
1. A logger for logging operations and errors.
2. A scheme specifying the type of object storage (e.g., "s3", "azblob", "gs").
3. A bucket object representing the target bucket in the storage service.
4. Optional configuration options like prefix and polling options.

The package supports various URL schemes for different storage providers, allowing for flexible configuration through URL strings.

This package plays a crucial role in managing configuration data stored in cloud object storage services, providing a consistent interface for retrieving and updating this data across different storage providers.
