## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for different reference resolvers used in the Git storage implementation of Flipt. It ensures that the `staticResolver` and `semverResolver` functions correctly resolve Git references (branches, tags) to their corresponding commit hashes.

## Code Structure
This file defines three main test functions: `TestStaticResolver`, `TestSemverResolver`, and a helper struct `gitRepoTest` with its associated methods. The test functions utilize the `gitRepoTest` struct to interact with a Git repository for testing purposes.

## Symbols

### `TestStaticResolver`
#### Description
This function tests the `staticResolver` function, which is designed to resolve static Git references (branch names). It creates a Git repository, performs commits and branch checkouts, and verifies that the resolver correctly returns the expected commit hash for each branch.

#### Inputs
This function takes a single argument:
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `t` | `*testing.T` | A testing object from the `testing` package, used for reporting test results and errors. |

#### Outputs
This function does not return any values.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Arrange:**
    - Initializes a new Git repository using the `newGitRepo` helper function.
    - Creates a `staticResolver`.
2. **Act:**
    - Creates a commit on the `main` branch and retrieves its hash.
    - Calls the `staticResolver` to resolve the `main` reference.
    - Checks if the resolved hash matches the expected commit hash.
    - Checks out a new branch (`new-branch`).
    - Creates a commit on the `new-branch` and retrieves its hash.
    - Calls the `staticResolver` to resolve the `new-branch` reference.
    - Checks if the resolved hash matches the expected commit hash.
3. **Assert:**
    - Uses `require.NoError` to assert that no errors occurred during the resolution process.
    - Uses `require.Equal` to assert that the resolved commit hash matches the expected hash for each branch.

### `TestSemverResolver`
#### Description
This function tests the `semverResolver` function, which is designed to resolve Git references based on semantic versioning (SemVer) tags. It creates a Git repository, creates tags following the SemVer convention, and verifies that the resolver correctly returns the commit hash associated with the matching tag.

#### Inputs
This function takes a single argument:
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `t` | `*testing.T` | A testing object from the `testing` package, used for reporting test results and errors. |

#### Outputs
This function does not return any values.

#### Internal Logic
This function includes multiple sub-tests to cover different scenarios:

**Sub-test 1: "should resolve semver tags correctly when the reference is a constraint"**
1. **Arrange:**
    - Initializes a new Git repository using the `newGitRepo` helper function.
    - Creates a `semverResolver`.
    - Defines a SemVer constraint (`v0.1.*`).
2. **Act:**
    - Creates a commit and tags it with `v0.1.0`.
    - Calls the `semverResolver` to resolve the constraint.
    - Checks if the resolved hash matches the expected commit hash.
    - Creates another commit and tags it with `v0.1.4`.
    - Calls the `semverResolver` again to resolve the same constraint.
    - Checks if the resolved hash now points to the newer commit.
3. **Assert:**
    - Uses `require.NoError` to assert that no errors occurred during the resolution process.
    - Uses `require.Equal` to assert that the resolved commit hash matches the expected hash for each tag.

**Sub-test 2: "should resolve semver tags correctly when the reference is not a constraint"**
1. **Arrange:**
    - Initializes a new Git repository using the `newGitRepo` helper function.
    - Creates a `semverResolver`.
2. **Act:**
    - Creates a commit and tags it with `v0.1.0`.
    - Calls the `semverResolver` to resolve the specific tag `v0.1.0`.
    - Checks if the resolved hash matches the expected commit hash.
3. **Assert:**
    - Uses `require.NoError` to assert that no errors occurred during the resolution process.
    - Uses `require.Equal` to assert that the resolved commit hash matches the expected hash.

**Sub-test 3: "should resolve semver tags correctly when there is non compliant semver tags"**
1. **Arrange:**
    - Initializes a new Git repository using the `newGitRepo` helper function.
    - Creates a `semverResolver`.
2. **Act:**
    - Creates a commit and tags it with a non-SemVer compliant tag (`non-semver-tag`).
    - Creates another commit and tags it with a SemVer compliant tag (`v0.1.0`).
    - Calls the `semverResolver` to resolve the `v0.1.0` tag.
    - Checks if the resolved hash matches the expected commit hash of the SemVer compliant tag.
3. **Assert:**
    - Uses `require.NoError` to assert that no errors occurred during the resolution process.
    - Uses `require.Equal` to assert that the resolved commit hash matches the expected hash.

**Sub-test 4: "should return an error when no matching tag was found"**
1. **Arrange:**
    - Initializes a new Git repository using the `newGitRepo` helper function.
    - Creates a `semverResolver`.
2. **Act:**
    - Creates a commit and tags it with `v0.1.0`.
    - Calls the `semverResolver` to resolve a non-matching SemVer constraint (`v1.*.*`).
3. **Assert:**
    - Uses `require.ErrorContains` to assert that the resolver returns an error indicating that no matching tag was found.

### `gitRepoTest`
#### Description
This is a helper struct that provides utility methods for interacting with a Git repository within the tests. It simplifies common Git operations like creating commits, checking out branches, and creating tags.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a struct definition, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a struct definition, not a function.

#### Internal Logic
This struct defines the following methods:

- `createCommit(t *testing.T) plumbing.Hash`: Creates a new commit in the Git repository with a dummy file and returns the commit hash.
- `checkout(t *testing.T, branchName string)`: Checks out a branch in the Git repository. If the branch doesn't exist, it creates a new one.
- `createTag(t *testing.T, tag string, commit plumbing.Hash)`: Creates a new tag on a specific commit in the Git repository.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `github.com/go-git/go-git/v5` | Provides Git functionalities like repository manipulation, commit creation, and branch management. |
| `github.com/go-git/go-billy/v5/memfs` | Offers an in-memory filesystem implementation used for testing the Git repository without relying on the disk. |
| `github.com/go-git/go-git/v5/storage/memory` | Provides an in-memory storage implementation for the Git repository. |
| `github.com/google/uuid` | Used for generating unique file names during commit creation. |
| `github.com/stretchr/testify/require` | Offers assertion functionalities for testing purposes. |

## Error Handling
The tests primarily rely on the `require` package for assertions. If any error occurs during the test execution, the `require` functions will fail the test and provide informative error messages.

## TODOs
N/A - There are no TODOs in the provided code.
