## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of a Git-based storage system for Flipt, a feature flag management tool. It provides functionality to store and retrieve feature flag configurations from a Git repository, allowing version control and collaboration on feature flag definitions.

## What does it do?
The Git storage system in this directory accomplishes the following:

1. Connects to a remote Git repository to fetch feature flag configurations.
2. Resolves Git references (branches, tags, or commit hashes) to specific commits.
3. Builds and caches snapshots of the feature flag configurations for each resolved commit.
4. Provides a mechanism to view the latest snapshot or a snapshot at a specific reference.
5. Periodically polls the remote repository for updates and rebuilds snapshots when changes are detected.
6. Supports various authentication methods and TLS configurations for secure connections to Git repositories.
7. Allows scoping flag discovery to a specific subdirectory within the Git repository.
8. Implements semantic versioning (SemVer) resolution for Git tags.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this module is the `NewSnapshotStore` function in `store.go`. This function creates a new `SnapshotStore` instance, which is the primary interface for interacting with the Git-based storage system.

The `SnapshotStore` struct provides methods like `View` for accessing snapshots and implements the `storagefs.ReferencedSnapshotStore` interface.

## Key Files
1. `store.go`: Contains the core implementation of the `SnapshotStore` struct and related methods.
2. `reference_resolvers.go`: Implements functions for resolving Git references to commit hashes.
3. `store_test.go`: Contains unit tests for the `SnapshotStore` implementation.
4. `reference_resolvers_test.go`: Contains unit tests for the reference resolver functions.

## Dependencies
The module relies on several external libraries:

1. `github.com/go-git/go-git/v5`: Used for Git operations and repository management.
2. `github.com/Masterminds/semver/v3`: Used for semantic versioning support.
3. `go.uber.org/zap`: Used for logging.
4. Various internal packages from the Flipt project, such as `storagefs`, `gitfs`, and `containers`.

## Configuration
The `SnapshotStore` can be configured using several options:

- `WithRef`: Sets the target Git reference.
- `WithSemverResolver`: Enables semantic versioning resolution for tags.
- `WithPollOptions`: Configures the polling mechanism for updates.
- `WithAuth`: Sets the authentication method for the Git repository.
- `WithInsecureTLS`: Allows skipping TLS certificate verification.
- `WithCABundle`: Sets a custom CA bundle for TLS verification.
- `WithDirectory`: Specifies a subdirectory within the repository for flag discovery.
- `WithFilesystemStorage`: Uses local filesystem storage instead of in-memory storage.

These options provide flexibility in how the Git-based storage system is set up and used within the larger Flipt application.
