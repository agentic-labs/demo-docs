## High-level description
This code defines a set of reference resolvers for a Git repository, used to determine the commit hash associated with a given reference (branch, tag, or commit SHA). It includes resolvers for static references (branches and commit SHAs) and semantic versioning (SemVer) tags.

## Code Structure
The code defines a `referenceResolver` type for functions that resolve Git references to commit hashes. It implements two resolvers: `staticResolver` for branches and commit SHAs, and `semverResolver` for SemVer tags. Both resolvers take a Git repository and a reference string as input and return the corresponding commit hash.

## Symbols
### `referenceResolver`
#### Description
`referenceResolver` is a function type that defines the signature for reference resolver functions. These functions take a Git repository and a reference string as input and return the corresponding commit hash or an error if the reference cannot be resolved.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| repo | *git.Repository | A pointer to the Git repository. |
| ref | string | The reference string to resolve (branch, tag, or commit SHA). |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| plumbing.Hash |  | The commit hash corresponding to the resolved reference. |
| error |  | An error if the reference cannot be resolved. |

### `staticResolver`
#### Description
`staticResolver` is a function that resolves static references, which are either branch names or commit SHAs.

#### Inputs
N/A - It doesn't take explicit inputs, but it uses the inputs provided to the returned `referenceResolver` function.

#### Outputs
N/A - It doesn't return explicit outputs, but it uses the outputs of the returned `referenceResolver` function.

#### Internal Logic
1. It checks if the input `ref` is a valid commit SHA using `plumbing.IsHash`. If it is, it returns the SHA as a `plumbing.Hash`.
2. Otherwise, it assumes the `ref` is a branch name and attempts to retrieve the branch reference using `repo.Reference` with `plumbing.NewBranchReferenceName`.
3. If the branch is found, it returns the commit hash associated with the branch head.
4. If the branch is not found or any error occurs, it returns an error.

### `semverResolver`
#### Description
`semverResolver` is a function that resolves semantic versioning (SemVer) tags.

#### Inputs
N/A - It doesn't take explicit inputs, but it uses the inputs provided to the returned `referenceResolver` function.

#### Outputs
N/A - It doesn't return explicit outputs, but it uses the outputs of the returned `referenceResolver` function.

#### Internal Logic
1. It parses the input `ref` as a SemVer constraint using `semver.NewConstraint`.
2. It retrieves all tags from the repository using `repo.Tags`.
3. It iterates through each tag and attempts to parse the tag name as a SemVer version using `semver.NewVersion`.
4. If the tag name is a valid SemVer version and satisfies the constraint, it compares it with the current maximum version found.
5. If the current tag version is greater than the maximum version, it updates the maximum version and its corresponding commit hash.
6. After iterating through all tags, it returns the commit hash associated with the maximum SemVer tag that satisfies the constraint.
7. If no matching tag is found or any error occurs, it returns an error.
