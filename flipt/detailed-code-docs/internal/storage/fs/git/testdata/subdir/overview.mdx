## High-level description
This directory contains configuration files for a Flipt evaluation engine. It includes two YAML files that define different aspects of the configuration, allowing for modular and flexible setup of the Flipt system.

## What does it do?
This directory sets up a configuration structure for a feature flagging system called Flipt. It does this in two parts:

1. The main configuration file (.flipt.yml) tells the Flipt system to include an additional configuration file.
2. The additional file (alternative.yml) defines a specific namespace and a feature flag within that namespace.

This setup allows for separating different environments or scenarios in the feature flagging system. For example, you could have different configurations for development, testing, and production environments, or for different parts of your application.

## Key Files
1. `.flipt.yml`: This is the main configuration file for the Flipt system. It specifies the version of the configuration format being used and instructs the system to include an additional configuration file.

2. `alternative.yml`: This file defines a specific namespace called "alternative" and sets up a feature flag within that namespace. The flag is named "Other Flag" and has a key of "otherflag".

## Configuration
The configuration is split across two files:

1. `.flipt.yml`:
   ```yaml
   version: "1.0"
   include:
     - alternative.yml
   ```
   This file specifies the configuration version and includes the `alternative.yml` file.

2. `alternative.yml`:
   ```yaml
   namespace: alternative
   flags:
     - key: otherflag
       name: Other Flag
   ```
   This file defines a namespace called "alternative" and a flag within that namespace.

The configuration allows for:
- Modular setup: By including additional files, you can organize your configuration into logical units.
- Namespace definition: The "alternative" namespace is defined, allowing for isolation of flags in different parts of your system.
- Flag definition: A flag named "Other Flag" is defined with the key "otherflag". This flag can be used in your application to control feature availability or behavior.

This setup demonstrates a flexible approach to managing feature flags, allowing for easy expansion and organization of flags across different namespaces or environments.
