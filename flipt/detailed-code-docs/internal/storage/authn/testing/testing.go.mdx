## High-level description
The `TestAuthenticationStoreHarness` function is a test harness for implementations of the `storageauth.Store` interface. It performs a series of tests to ensure that the store correctly creates, retrieves, lists, and deletes authentication entities.

## Code Structure
The `TestAuthenticationStoreHarness` function takes a function `fn` as an argument, which is responsible for creating a new instance of the `storageauth.Store` implementation under test. The harness then defines a series of subtests that exercise the store's functionality.

## Symbols
### `TestAuthenticationStoreHarness`
#### Description
This function is a test harness for implementations of the `storageauth.Store` interface. It performs a series of tests to ensure that the store correctly creates, retrieves, lists, and deletes authentication entities.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| t | *testing.T | The testing object. |
| fn | func(t *testing.T) storageauth.Store | A function that returns a new instance of the `storageauth.Store` implementation under test. |

#### Outputs
None.

#### Internal Logic
The function defines a series of subtests, each testing a specific aspect of the `storageauth.Store` interface:
- **Create 100 authentications:** Creates 100 authentication entities with unique tokens and expiry times.
- **Get each authentication by token:** Retrieves each created authentication entity using its client token.
- **Get each authentication by ID:** Retrieves each created authentication entity using its ID.
- **List all authentications (3 per page ascending):** Lists all authentication entities in ascending order, 3 per page.
- **List all authentications (6 per page descending):** Lists all authentication entities in descending order, 6 per page.
- **Delete must be predicated:** Verifies that deleting authentication entities requires a predicate.
- **Delete a single instance by ID:** Deletes a single authentication entity by its ID.
- **Delete by method Token with before expired constraint:** Deletes all authentication entities with the method `Token` and an expiry time before a specified time.
- **Delete any token type before expired constraint:** Deletes all authentication entities with an expiry time before a specified time, regardless of their method.
- **Delete the rest of the tokens with an expiration:** Deletes all remaining authentication entities with an expiry time.
- **Expire a single instance by ID:** Expires a single authentication entity by setting its expiry time to the past.

Each subtest uses assertions to verify that the store behaves as expected.

## Side Effects
None.

## Error Handling
The function uses the `require` package to fail tests immediately if an error occurs. It also uses the `assert` package to verify that errors are of the expected type.
