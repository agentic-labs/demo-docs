## High-level description
The `internal/storage/authn` directory contains the implementation of authentication storage for the Flipt project. It provides interfaces and implementations for managing authentication tokens, including creation, retrieval, deletion, and expiration of tokens. The package also includes utilities for token generation and hashing, as well as a bootstrapping mechanism for initial token creation.

## What does it do?
This package manages the lifecycle of authentication tokens in the Flipt system. It provides functionality to:

1. Create new authentication tokens with associated metadata and expiration times.
2. Retrieve authentication tokens by ID or client token.
3. List authentication tokens with filtering options.
4. Delete authentication tokens based on various criteria (ID, method, expiration time).
5. Expire authentication tokens.
6. Generate random tokens and hash client tokens for secure storage.
7. Bootstrap the authentication system with an initial token.

The package supports different storage backends, including in-memory storage for testing and SQL-based storage for production use. It also includes a caching layer to improve performance by reducing database queries.

## Entry points
The main entry points for this package are:

1. `Store` interface in `auth.go`: Defines the methods for interacting with the authentication store.
2. `Bootstrap` function in `bootstrap.go`: Used to create an initial authentication token if none exist.
3. `NewStore` functions in `memory/store.go` and `sql/store.go`: Create new instances of memory-based and SQL-based authentication stores, respectively.
4. `Store` struct in `cache/cache.go`: Provides a caching layer wrapper around the main authentication store.

The data flow typically starts with the creation of an authentication token, which is then stored in the chosen backend (memory or SQL). Subsequent operations retrieve, list, or modify these tokens. The caching layer, when used, intercepts these operations to improve performance.

## Key Files
1. `auth.go`: Defines the core `Store` interface and related data structures.
2. `bootstrap.go`: Implements the bootstrapping mechanism for initial token creation.
3. `memory/store.go`: Provides an in-memory implementation of the `Store` interface.
4. `sql/store.go`: Implements a SQL-based storage backend for authentication tokens.
5. `cache/cache.go`: Implements a caching layer for the authentication store.
6. `testing/harness.go`: Contains a test harness for validating `Store` implementations.

## Dependencies
The package relies on several external libraries and internal packages:

1. `github.com/gofrs/uuid`: For generating UUIDs.
2. `go.uber.org/zap`: For structured logging.
3. `google.golang.org/protobuf`: For working with Protocol Buffers.
4. `go.flipt.io/flipt/internal/storage`: For common storage interfaces and utilities.
5. `go.flipt.io/flipt/rpc/flipt/auth`: For authentication-related Protocol Buffer definitions.

## Configuration
The authentication store can be configured through various options:

1. `WithNowFunc`: Overrides the function used for generating timestamps.
2. `WithTokenGeneratorFunc`: Customizes the function used for generating authentication tokens.
3. `WithIDGeneratorFunc`: Overrides the function used for generating authentication IDs.
4. `WithExpiration`: Sets the expiration time for bootstrap tokens.
5. `WithToken`: Specifies a predefined token for bootstrapping.
6. `WithMetadataAttribute`: Adds metadata to bootstrap tokens.

These options allow for customization of the authentication store's behavior, particularly useful for testing scenarios or specific implementation requirements.

In summary, the `internal/storage/authn` package provides a comprehensive solution for managing authentication tokens in the Flipt system, with support for different storage backends, caching, and customizable behavior.
