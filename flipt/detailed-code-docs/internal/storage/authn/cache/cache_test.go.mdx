## High-level description
The code defines a set of unit tests for the `cache` package, specifically for the caching layer used with the authentication storage. It ensures that authentication data is cached and retrieved correctly, and that cache invalidation works as expected.

## Code Structure
The code consists of three test functions, each testing a different aspect of the caching layer: `TestGetAuthenticationByClientToken`, `TestGetAuthenticationByClientTokenCached`, and `TestExpireAuthenticationByID`. Each test sets up a mock store and a spy cache, then performs operations on the cached store and verifies the expected behavior of both the store and the cache.

## Symbols

### `TestGetAuthenticationByClientToken`
#### Description
This test function verifies that the `GetAuthenticationByClientToken` method correctly retrieves authentication data from the cache, and if not present, from the underlying store, and then caches the result.

#### Inputs
This is a test function, it takes no input.

#### Outputs
This is a test function, it produces no output.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Arrange:**
   - Creates a mock authentication object and a mock store.
   - Configures the mock store to return the mock authentication when `GetAuthenticationByClientToken` is called.
   - Creates a spy cache and a cached store using the mock store, spy cache, and a test logger.
2. **Act:**
   - Calls `GetAuthenticationByClientToken` on the cached store with a test token.
3. **Assert:**
   - Asserts that the returned error is nil.
   - Asserts that the returned authentication object is not nil and its ID matches the mock authentication.
   - Asserts that the cache was checked with the correct key.
   - Asserts that the cache was set with the correct keys and values for both the token and the authentication object.

### `TestGetAuthenticationByClientTokenCached`
#### Description
This test function verifies that the `GetAuthenticationByClientToken` method correctly retrieves authentication data from the cache when it is already present.

#### Inputs
This is a test function, it takes no input.

#### Outputs
This is a test function, it produces no output.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Arrange:**
   - Creates a mock authentication object.
   - Creates a mock store, but doesn't set any expectations on it, as it should not be called.
   - Creates a spy cache and pre-populates it with the mock authentication data.
   - Creates a cached store using the mock store, spy cache, and a test logger.
2. **Act:**
   - Calls `GetAuthenticationByClientToken` on the cached store with a test token.
3. **Assert:**
   - Asserts that the returned error is nil.
   - Asserts that the returned authentication object is not nil and its ID matches the mock authentication.
   - Asserts that the cache was checked with the correct key.

### `TestExpireAuthenticationByID`
#### Description
This test function verifies that the `ExpireAuthenticationByID` method correctly invalidates cached authentication data when called.

#### Inputs
This is a test function, it takes no input.

#### Outputs
This is a test function, it produces no output.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Arrange:**
   - Creates a mock store and configures it to expect a call to `ExpireAuthenticationByID`.
   - Creates a spy cache and pre-populates it with mock authentication data.
   - Creates a cached store using the mock store, spy cache, and a test logger.
2. **Act:**
   - Calls `ExpireAuthenticationByID` on the cached store with a test ID.
3. **Assert:**
   - Asserts that the returned error is nil.
   - Asserts that the cache was checked with the correct key.
   - Asserts that the correct keys were deleted from the cache.
