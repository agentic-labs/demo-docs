## High-level description
The code in `auth_test.go` defines unit tests for the `authn` package, specifically focusing on functions related to authentication token hashing and request validation. It utilizes the `github.com/stretchr/testify` package for assertions.

## References
- `HashClientToken` (from the same package)
- `Delete` (from the same package)
- `WithID`, `WithMethod`, `WithExpiredBefore` (from the same package)
- `GenerateRandomToken` (from the same package)

## Symbols

### `FuzzHashClientToken`
#### Description
This function is a fuzz test for the `HashClientToken` function. It generates a series of random string and byte slice inputs, hashes them using `HashClientToken`, and asserts that the hashing process doesn't return an error, the result is not empty, and the result is a valid base64 URL encoded string.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| f | *testing.F | The fuzzing framework instance. |

#### Outputs
This function doesn't have explicit outputs. It uses the `require` package for assertions within the fuzzing function.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Define seed inputs:** The function defines two sets of seed inputs:
    - A slice of strings: `"hello, world"`, `"supersecretstring"`, `"egGpvIxtdG6tI3OIJjXOrv7xZW3hRMYg/Lt/G6X/UEwC"`.
    - A slice of byte slices: `{}, {0}, {9}, {0xa}, {0xf}, {1, 2, 3, 4}`.
2. **Add seeds to fuzzing engine:** It adds each seed input to the fuzzing engine using `f.Add`.
3. **Define fuzzing function:** It defines a fuzzing function that takes a string `token` as input.
4. **Hash the token:** Inside the fuzzing function, it calls `HashClientToken(token)` to get the hashed token and any error.
5. **Assert no error:** It asserts that there is no error during hashing using `require.NoError(t, err)`.
6. **Assert non-empty result:** It asserts that the hashed token is not empty using `require.NotEmpty(t, hashed, "hashed result is empty")`.
7. **Assert valid base64 URL encoding:** It attempts to decode the hashed token using `base64.URLEncoding.DecodeString(hashed)` and asserts that there is no error, indicating a valid base64 URL encoded string.

### `TestDelete_Valid`
#### Description
This function is a unit test that checks the `Valid` method of the `Delete` request builder. It creates a valid `Delete` request and asserts that the validation passes without errors.

#### Inputs
This function doesn't have explicit inputs. It uses the `t *testing.T` testing object.

#### Outputs
This function doesn't have explicit outputs. It uses the `assert` package for assertions.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Create a valid Delete request:** It creates a `Delete` request using the builder pattern with the following options:
    - `WithID("987654321")`: Sets the ID of the authentication to be deleted.
    - `WithMethod(auth.Method_METHOD_TOKEN)`: Sets the authentication method to `METHOD_TOKEN`.
    - `WithExpiredBefore(time.Now())`: Sets the expiration time to the current time.
2. **Validate the request:** It calls the `Valid()` method on the created `Delete` request.
3. **Assert no error:** It asserts that the validation passes without errors using `assert.NoError(t, err)`.

### `TestDelete_Invalid`
#### Description
This function is a unit test that checks the `Valid` method of the `Delete` request builder. It creates an invalid `Delete` request (without any parameters) and asserts that the validation fails with an error.

#### Inputs
This function doesn't have explicit inputs. It uses the `t *testing.T` testing object.

#### Outputs
This function doesn't have explicit outputs. It uses the `assert` package for assertions.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Create an invalid Delete request:** It creates a `Delete` request without any parameters, making it invalid.
2. **Validate the request:** It calls the `Valid()` method on the created `Delete` request.
3. **Assert error:** It asserts that the validation fails with an error using `assert.Error(t, err)`.

### `TestGenerateRandomToken`
#### Description
This function is a unit test that checks the `GenerateRandomToken` function. It generates a random token and asserts that the generated token is not empty.

#### Inputs
This function doesn't have explicit inputs. It uses the `t *testing.T` testing object.

#### Outputs
This function doesn't have explicit outputs. It uses the `assert` package for assertions.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Generate a random token:** It calls the `GenerateRandomToken()` function to generate a random token.
2. **Assert non-empty token:** It asserts that the generated token is not empty using `assert.NotEmpty(t, s)`.
