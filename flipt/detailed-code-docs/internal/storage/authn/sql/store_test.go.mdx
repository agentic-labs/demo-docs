## High-level description
The `store_test.go` file contains unit tests for the `Store` struct, which is responsible for managing authentication data in a SQL database. The tests cover various aspects of the authentication store, including creating, retrieving, listing, and deleting authentication entries.

## Code Structure
The code defines several test functions, each focusing on a specific aspect of the `Store` struct. These test functions utilize helper functions like `newTestStore`, `createAuth`, and `commonOpts` to set up test data and configure the store for testing.

## Symbols

### `TestAuthenticationStoreHarness`
#### Description
This function runs a suite of tests against the `Store` implementation using the `TestAuthenticationStoreHarness` function from the `authtesting` package. This ensures that the `Store` implementation adheres to the expected behavior of an authentication store.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| t | *testing.T | The testing object. |
| fn | func(*testing.T) storageauth.Store | A function that returns a new instance of the `Store` implementation. |

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
The function calls the `TestAuthenticationStoreHarness` function, passing in a closure that creates a new instance of the `Store` using the `newTestStore` helper function.

### `TestAuthentication_CreateAuthentication`
#### Description
This test function verifies the functionality of the `CreateAuthentication` method of the `Store` struct. It tests various scenarios, including successful authentication creation, handling ID and token uniqueness constraints, and setting authentication expiration.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| t | *testing.T | The testing object. |

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
The function iterates through a set of test cases, each defining a specific scenario for authentication creation. For each test case, it:
- Creates a new instance of the `Store` with pre-seeded data using the `newTestStore` helper function.
- Calls the `CreateAuthentication` method with the test case's request.
- Asserts that the returned error, client token, and created authentication object match the expected values.

### `TestAuthentication_GetAuthenticationByClientToken`
#### Description
This test function verifies the functionality of the `GetAuthenticationByClientToken` method of the `Store` struct. It tests retrieving an authentication entry using a valid client token and handles the scenario where the token is not found.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| t | *testing.T | The testing object. |

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
The function iterates through a set of test cases, each defining a client token and the expected outcome. For each test case, it:
- Creates a new instance of the `Store` with pre-seeded data using the `newTestStore` helper function.
- Calls the `GetAuthenticationByClientToken` method with the test case's client token.
- Asserts that the returned error and authentication object match the expected values.

### `TestAuthentication_ListAuthentications_ByMethod`
#### Description
This test function verifies the functionality of the `ListAuthentications` method of the `Store` struct, specifically focusing on filtering authentications by their method. It tests listing authentications with different methods and asserts that the returned results match the expected values.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| t | *testing.T | The testing object. |

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
The function creates a new instance of the `Store` with pre-seeded authentication entries having different methods. It then defines two test cases, one for each method:
- For each test case, it creates a `ListRequest` with a predicate filtering by the specific method.
- It calls the `ListAuthentications` method with the request.
- It asserts that the returned result set contains the expected authentication entries based on the filtering criteria.
