## High-level description
This directory contains the SQL-backed implementation of the authentication store for the Flipt project. It provides a `Store` struct that implements the `storageauth.Store` interface, managing the persistence of authentication data in a SQL database.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory handles the storage and retrieval of authentication data using a SQL database. It provides functionality to:

1. Create new authentication entries
2. Retrieve authentication entries by client token or ID
3. List authentication entries with pagination and filtering options
4. Delete authentication entries
5. Expire authentication entries by setting an expiration timestamp

The implementation uses a SQL statement builder for constructing database queries and offers options for customizing ID and token generation, as well as the current time function.

## Key Files

### store.go
This file contains the main implementation of the `Store` struct and its methods. It defines the following key components:

1. `Store` struct: Holds dependencies like the logger, SQL driver, and statement builder.
2. `NewStore` function: Constructs a new `Store` instance with customizable options.
3. CRUD operations: Methods for creating, retrieving, listing, deleting, and expiring authentication entries.
4. Helper functions: Internal functions for scanning SQL rows and generating IDs/tokens.

### store_test.go
This file contains unit tests for the `Store` struct implementation. It includes:

1. A test harness that runs a suite of tests against the `Store` implementation.
2. Specific test cases for creating, retrieving, and listing authentication entries.
3. Helper functions for setting up test data and configuring the store for testing.

## Dependencies
The implementation relies on several external libraries and internal packages:

1. `github.com/gofrs/uuid`: For generating UUIDs.
2. `go.flipt.io/flipt/internal/storage`: Defines the `Store` interface for authentication data.
3. `go.flipt.io/flipt/internal/storage/authn`: Provides common authentication-related types and functions.
4. `go.flipt.io/flipt/internal/storage/sql`: Offers utilities for interacting with SQL databases.
5. `go.flipt.io/flipt/rpc/flipt/auth`: Defines the protobuf messages for authentication.
6. `go.uber.org/zap`: For structured logging.
7. `google.golang.org/protobuf/types/known/timestamppb`: For working with protobuf timestamps.

## Configuration
The `Store` struct can be configured using option functions:

1. `WithNowFunc`: Overrides the default function for getting the current time.
2. `WithTokenGeneratorFunc`: Overrides the default function for generating client tokens.
3. `WithIDGeneratorFunc`: Overrides the default function for generating authentication IDs.

These options allow for customization of the store's behavior, particularly useful for testing scenarios or specific implementation requirements.

Here's an example of how to create a new `Store` instance with custom options:

```go
store := NewStore(
    driver,
    builder,
    logger,
    WithNowFunc(customNowFunc),
    WithTokenGeneratorFunc(customTokenGenerator),
    WithIDGeneratorFunc(customIDGenerator),
)
```

This implementation provides a flexible and extensible way to manage authentication data in a SQL database, with comprehensive test coverage to ensure reliability and correctness.
