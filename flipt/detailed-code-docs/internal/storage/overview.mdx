## High-level description
The `internal/storage` directory contains the core storage layer implementations for the Flipt project. It provides interfaces and implementations for various storage backends, including SQL databases, file systems, and in-memory storage. This package is responsible for managing feature flags, segments, rules, and other configuration data used by Flipt.

## What does it do?
The storage layer in this directory accomplishes the following key tasks:

1. Defines interfaces for interacting with different types of storage backends (SQL, file system, in-memory).
2. Implements CRUD operations for feature flags, segments, rules, and other Flipt entities.
3. Provides caching mechanisms to improve performance.
4. Manages authentication tokens and distributed locks for concurrent operations.
5. Supports different storage types, including local file systems, Git repositories, object storage, and OCI repositories.
6. Implements pagination and filtering for list operations.
7. Handles database migrations and schema management.
8. Provides utilities for setting up test databases and running integration tests.

## Entry points
The main entry points for this package are:

1. `Store` interface in `storage.go`: Defines the core interface for interacting with the storage layer.
2. `NewStore` functions in various subdirectories: Create new instances of specific storage implementations (e.g., SQL, file system).
3. `Open` function in `sql/testing/testing.go`: Sets up test database instances for integration testing.

The code is organized around these key components:

- Core interfaces (`Store`, `ReadOnlyStore`, `EvaluationStore`, etc.) in `storage.go`
- SQL implementation in the `sql` subdirectory
- File system implementation in the `fs` subdirectory
- Caching layer in the `cache` subdirectory
- Authentication storage in the `authn` subdirectory
- Operation lock service in the `oplock` subdirectory

## Key Files
1. `storage.go`: Defines core interfaces and data structures for the storage layer.
2. `sql/store.go`: Implements the SQL-based storage backend.
3. `fs/store.go`: Implements the file system-based storage backend.
4. `cache/cache.go`: Provides a caching layer for improved performance.
5. `authn/auth.go`: Manages authentication tokens and related operations.
6. `oplock/oplock.go`: Implements distributed locks for concurrent operations.
7. `list.go`: Provides utilities for paginated list operations.

## Dependencies
The storage layer relies on several external libraries and internal packages:

1. `github.com/gofrs/uuid`: For generating UUIDs.
2. `github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/v4`: For managing database migrations.
3. `github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-go`: For creating test database containers.
4. `go.uber.org/zap`: For structured logging.
5. `google.golang.org/protobuf`: For working with Protocol Buffers.
6. Various internal Flipt packages for common functionality and interfaces.

## Configuration
The storage layer can be configured through various options and environment variables:

1. Database connection settings (for SQL backends)
2. File system paths and storage types (for file system backends)
3. Caching options
4. Authentication token settings
5. Test database configuration (e.g., `FLIPT_TEST_DATABASE_PROTOCOL`)

Example configuration for SQL storage:

```go
cfg := &config.Config{
    Database: config.Database{
        URL:      "postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/flipt",
        Protocol: "postgres",
    },
}
store, err := sql.NewStore(cfg)
```

In summary, the `internal/storage` directory provides a comprehensive and flexible storage layer for the Flipt project. It supports various backend types, implements caching and distributed locking, and offers utilities for testing and database management. This package is crucial for the overall functionality of Flipt, enabling efficient storage and retrieval of feature flag configurations and related data.
