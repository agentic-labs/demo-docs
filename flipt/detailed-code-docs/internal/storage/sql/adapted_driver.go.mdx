title: "adapted_driver.go"
---

## High-level description
The code defines an adapted Postgres driver that wraps the standard `pgx` driver and a custom adapter. This allows for customizing connection errors and preventing the leakage of sensitive credentials.

## Code Structure
The code defines three main symbols: `adaptedDriver`, `adaptedConnector`, and `newAdaptedPostgresDriver`. 
- `newAdaptedPostgresDriver` is a function that creates a new instance of `adaptedDriver`. 
- `adaptedDriver` implements the `driver.Driver` and `driver.DriverContext` interfaces, providing methods for opening a connection and a connector. 
- `adaptedConnector` implements the `driver.Connector` interface and is responsible for establishing the actual connection to the database.

## Symbols

### `newAdaptedPostgresDriver`
#### Description
This function creates a new instance of the `adaptedDriver` struct, which wraps the standard `pgx` driver and a custom adapter.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| d | `Driver` | The custom adapter that implements the `Driver` interface. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| driver.Driver | An instance of the `adaptedDriver` struct, wrapped as a `driver.Driver`. |

#### Internal Logic
The function simply creates a new `adaptedDriver` struct, initializing its `origin` field with a new `pgx.Driver` and its `adapter` field with the provided custom adapter.

### `adaptedDriver`
#### Description
This struct implements the `driver.Driver` and `driver.DriverContext` interfaces, providing methods for opening a connection and a connector. It wraps the standard `pgx` driver and a custom adapter to customize connection errors and prevent credential leakage.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a struct definition.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a struct definition.

#### Internal Logic
The struct defines two methods:
- `Open`: This method opens a new connection to the database. It first calls `OpenConnector` to obtain a `driver.Connector` and then uses it to establish the connection with a timeout. Any errors returned by the connector are adapted using the custom adapter.
- `OpenConnector`: This method creates a new `adaptedConnector` instance, wrapping the underlying connector obtained from the `pgx` driver. Any errors returned by the underlying driver are adapted using the custom adapter.

### `adaptedConnector`
#### Description
This struct implements the `driver.Connector` interface and is responsible for establishing the actual connection to the database. It wraps the underlying connector obtained from the `pgx` driver and adapts any errors returned.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a struct definition.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a struct definition.

#### Internal Logic
The struct defines two methods:
- `Driver`: This method simply returns the `adaptedDriver` instance associated with this connector.
- `Connect`: This method calls the `Connect` method of the underlying connector obtained from the `pgx` driver. Any errors returned by the underlying connector are adapted using the custom adapter.

## References
- `Driver`: This is a custom interface defined in the same package, likely providing methods for adapting errors.
- `pgx.Driver`: This is the standard Postgres driver provided by the `github.com/jackc/pgx/v5/stdlib` package.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `database/sql/driver` | Provides the standard interfaces for interacting with SQL databases in Go. |
| `github.com/jackc/pgx/v5/stdlib` | Provides the `pgx` Postgres driver. |
| `context` | Used for setting a timeout when opening a connection. |
| `time` | Used for defining the timeout duration. |
