## High-level description
The `internal/storage/sql/testing` directory contains utility code for setting up and managing test databases for the Flipt project. It provides functionality to create and initialize test database instances for various database protocols (SQLite, PostgreSQL, CockroachDB, MySQL) using Docker containers when necessary. This package is crucial for running integration tests and benchmarks that require a real database connection.

## What does it do?
This package accomplishes the following tasks:

1. Creates test database instances for different database protocols.
2. Spins up Docker containers for PostgreSQL, CockroachDB, and MySQL databases when needed.
3. Sets up database connections and runs migrations to prepare the test environment.
4. Provides cleanup functionality to tear down test databases and containers after tests are complete.
5. Offers utilities for creating temporary SQLite database files.
6. Allows for verbose logging of container output during tests.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this package is the `Open()` function, which creates and initializes a test database instance based on the configured database protocol. Developers should use this function to set up a test database for their integration tests or benchmarks.

The code is organized around the following key components:

1. `Database` struct: Represents a test database instance, holding references to the database connection, driver, and container (if applicable).
2. `DBContainer` struct: Represents a Docker container running a database instance.
3. `Open()` function: The main entry point for creating and initializing a test database.
4. `NewDBContainer()` function: Creates and starts a new Docker container for a specified database protocol.
5. `newMigrator()` function: Creates a new migrate.Migrate instance for running database migrations.

Data flow typically starts with a call to `Open()`, which then determines the database protocol to use, sets up the necessary resources (including Docker containers if needed), establishes a database connection, and runs migrations to prepare the database schema.

## Key Files
1. `testing.go`: This is the main file in the package, containing all the functionality described above. It defines the structures and functions necessary for setting up and managing test databases.

## Dependencies
This package relies on several external libraries and internal packages:

1. `github.com/docker/go-connections/nat`: Used for mapping container ports to the host.
2. `github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/v4`: Used for managing database migrations.
3. `github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-go`: Used for creating and managing Docker containers.
4. `go.flipt.io/flipt/config/migrations`: Provides access to Flipt's database migration files.
5. `go.flipt.io/flipt/internal/config`: Defines configuration structures used by Flipt.
6. `go.flipt.io/flipt/internal/storage/sql`: Provides the core SQL storage implementation for Flipt.

## Configuration
The package uses environment variables for configuration:

1. `FLIPT_TEST_DATABASE_PROTOCOL`: Specifies the database protocol to use (defaults to SQLite if not set).
2. `FLIPT_TEST_DATABASE_VERBOSE`: When set to "true", enables verbose logging of container output.

The `Database` struct also includes a `cleanup` function that can be customized to perform additional cleanup tasks when tearing down the test database.

In summary, the `internal/storage/sql/testing` package provides a flexible and powerful set of tools for setting up and managing test databases in the Flipt project. It abstracts away the complexities of working with different database protocols and Docker containers, allowing developers to focus on writing and running integration tests and benchmarks with ease.
