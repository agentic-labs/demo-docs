## High-level description
This YAML file contains test data for benchmarking purposes. It defines a set of flags and segments, with each flag having two variants and each segment having two constraints. The data is structured to simulate a real-world scenario with multiple flags and segments for performance testing.

## Code Structure
The file defines two main sections: `flags` and `segments`. Each flag within the `flags` section has properties like `key`, `name`, `type`, `description`, `enabled`, `variants`, and `rules`. The `rules` section further defines how variants are distributed across different segments. The `segments` section defines segments with properties like `key`, `name`, `description`, `constraints`, and `match_type`.

## Symbols
This file does not contain any code symbols. It is a data file in YAML format.

## Configuration
The file defines configurations for flags and segments.

### Flags Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| key | string | N/A | Unique identifier for the flag |
| name | string | N/A | Human-readable name of the flag |
| type | string | N/A | Type of the flag (e.g., VARIANT_FLAG_TYPE, BOOLEAN_FLAG_TYPE) |
| description | string | N/A | Description of the flag |
| enabled | boolean | N/A | Whether the flag is enabled |
| variants | list | N/A | List of variants for the flag |
| rules | list | N/A | List of rules defining variant distribution across segments |

### Segments Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| key | string | N/A | Unique identifier for the segment |
| name | string | N/A | Human-readable name of the segment |
| description | string | N/A | Description of the segment |
| constraints | list | N/A | List of constraints defining segment membership |
| match_type | string | N/A | Type of match for constraints (e.g., ALL_MATCH_TYPE) |
