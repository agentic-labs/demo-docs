## High-level description
The `sqlite.go` file provides a SQLite-specific implementation of the `storage.Store` interface, which is responsible for interacting with a SQLite database to manage Flipt resources like namespaces, flags, variants, segments, and rules. It handles database operations and error management tailored to SQLite's behavior.

## Code Structure
The `sqlite.go` file defines a `Store` struct that embeds a `common.Store` from a common SQL package. This structure allows it to inherit common SQL operations and implement SQLite-specific logic for certain operations. The file primarily consists of methods attached to the `Store` struct, each handling a specific database interaction.

## Symbols

### `Store`
#### Description
The `Store` struct represents a SQLite-specific implementation of the `storage.Store` interface. It manages interactions with a SQLite database for Flipt resource management.

#### Inputs
This struct doesn't have explicit inputs. It's initialized with a database connection and other dependencies.

#### Outputs
This struct doesn't have explicit outputs. Its methods return operation results or errors.

#### Internal Logic
The `Store` struct itself doesn't contain complex internal logic. Its methods leverage the embedded `common.Store` and SQLite-specific error handling.

### `NewStore`
#### Description
The `NewStore` function creates and initializes a new `sqlite.Store` instance.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| db | `*sql.DB` | A pointer to a SQL database connection. |
| builder | `sq.StatementBuilderType` | A statement builder for constructing SQL queries. |
| logger | `*zap.Logger` | A logger instance for recording events. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| store | `*Store` | A pointer to the newly created `sqlite.Store` instance. |

### `(*Store) String`
#### Description
The `String` method returns a string representation of the store, which is simply "sqlite".

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| string | `string` | The string "sqlite" representing the store type. |

### Datastore Interaction Methods
The `sqlite.go` file includes a series of methods like `CreateNamespace`, `CreateFlag`, `UpdateFlag`, `CreateVariant`, etc. Each of these methods corresponds to a specific database operation related to managing Flipt resources. These methods typically:

1.  Call the corresponding method of the embedded `common.Store` to perform the SQL operation.
2.  Handle SQLite-specific errors, particularly constraint violations, and wrap them in Flipt's custom error types for better context.
3.  Return the result of the operation or an error if one occurred.

For example, the `CreateFlag` method attempts to create a new flag in the database. If a constraint violation occurs due to a duplicate flag key, it returns an `errs.ErrInvalidf` error indicating that the flag is not unique.

## Error Handling
The code extensively uses SQLite's error codes to identify specific constraint violations, such as primary key and foreign key constraints. It wraps these errors using Flipt's custom error types (`errs` package) to provide more meaningful error messages.

## Side Effects
The code interacts with a SQLite database, leading to side effects like data modification (creation, updates, deletions) and potentially database file changes.
