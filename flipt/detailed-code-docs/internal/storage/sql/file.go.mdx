## High-level description
The code defines a `fileInfo` type that implements the `fs.FileInfo` interface. This allows representing basic file information as strings, primarily for testing purposes.

## Code Structure
The `fileInfo` type is a string alias. It has methods that return file information like name, size, mode, modification time, and directory status.

## Symbols

### `fileInfo`
#### Description
`fileInfo` is a string alias that implements the `fs.FileInfo` interface. It provides a simple way to represent file information as strings.

#### Inputs
This is not a function and does not accept inputs.

#### Outputs
This is not a function and does not return outputs.

#### Internal Logic
The `fileInfo` type implements the following methods of the `fs.FileInfo` interface:

- `Name() string`: Returns the file name as a string.
- `Size() int64`: Returns 0 as the file size.
- `Mode() fs.FileMode`: Returns `fs.ModePerm` (0666) as the file mode.
- `ModTime() time.Time`: Returns the current time as the modification time.
- `IsDir() bool`: Returns `false` as it represents a file, not a directory.
- `Sys() interface{}`: Returns `nil`.

These methods provide a basic representation of file information, suitable for testing or situations where actual file system access is not required.

## Side Effects
This code has no side effects.

## Dependencies
- `io/fs`: Used for the `fs.FileInfo` and `fs.FileMode` types.
- `time`: Used for the `time.Time` type and `time.Now()` function.
