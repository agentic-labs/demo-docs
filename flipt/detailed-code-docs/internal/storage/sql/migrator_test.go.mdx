## High-level description
The `migrator_test.go` file contains unit tests for the `Migrator` struct in the `sql` package. It ensures that the database migration functionality works as expected, including running migrations, handling no-change scenarios, and verifying the expected number of migrations for different database drivers.

## Code Structure
The code consists of three test functions: `TestMigratorRun`, `TestMigratorRun_NoChange`, and `TestMigratorExpectedVersions`. Each test function sets up a test environment with a stub database and migration source, then exercises the `Migrator` struct's methods to verify its behavior.

## Symbols

### `TestMigratorRun`
#### Description
This test function verifies that the `Migrator.Up()` method successfully applies pending migrations to the database.

#### Inputs
This function takes a single argument `t *testing.T`, which is a testing context provided by the Go testing framework.

#### Outputs
This function does not return any values.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Arrange:**
    - Creates a stub database and sets up a stub migration source with one up and one down migration.
    - Initializes a `Migrator` instance with the stub database and migration source.
2. **Act:**
    - Calls the `Up()` method on the `Migrator` instance.
3. **Assert:**
    - Asserts that the `Up()` method returns no error, indicating successful migration.

### `TestMigratorRun_NoChange`
#### Description
This test function verifies that the `Migrator.Up()` method handles scenarios where there are no pending migrations to apply.

#### Inputs
This function takes a single argument `t *testing.T`, which is a testing context provided by the Go testing framework.

#### Outputs
This function does not return any values.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Arrange:**
    - Creates a stub database and sets its version to 1 (meaning one migration is already applied).
    - Sets up a stub migration source with one up and one down migration.
    - Initializes a `Migrator` instance with the stub database and migration source.
2. **Act:**
    - Calls the `Up()` method on the `Migrator` instance.
3. **Assert:**
    - Asserts that the `Up()` method returns no error, indicating successful handling of the no-change scenario.

### `TestMigratorExpectedVersions`
#### Description
This test function verifies that the `expectedVersions` map is up-to-date with the actual number of migrations available for each supported database driver.

#### Inputs
This function takes a single argument `t *testing.T`, which is a testing context provided by the Go testing framework.

#### Outputs
This function does not return any values.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Iterate through supported database drivers:**
    - For each driver, read the migration files from the corresponding directory.
    - Assert that there is at least one migration file.
    - Calculate the expected version based on the number of migration files.
    - Assert that the calculated expected version matches the value stored in the `expectedVersions` map for the current driver.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| "github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/v4" | Provides database migration functionality. |
| "github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/v4/database/stub" | Provides a stub database implementation for testing. |
| "github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/v4/source" | Provides interfaces for managing migration sources. |
| "github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/v4/source/stub" | Provides a stub migration source implementation for testing. |
| "github.com/stretchr/testify/assert" | Provides assertion functions for testing. |
| "github.com/stretchr/testify/require" | Provides assertion functions that stop test execution on failure. |
| "go.uber.org/zap/zaptest" | Provides a testing logger implementation. |

## Error Handling
The tests primarily rely on assertions to check for errors. If any of the tested functions return an error, the corresponding assertion will fail, causing the test to fail as well.
