## High-level description
The `internal/storage/sql/errors_test.go` file contains unit tests for the `AdaptError` function, which is responsible for converting database-specific errors into Flipt's internal error types. This ensures consistent error handling across different database backends.

## Code Structure
The code consists of a single test function, `Test_AdaptError`, which iterates through a series of test cases, each representing a different combination of database driver, input error, and expected output error.

## References
- `Driver`: An enum-like type defined in the same package, representing supported database drivers (SQLite, Postgres, MySQL).
- `errors.ErrNotFound`: A function from the `go.flipt.io/flipt/errors` package, used to create "not found" errors.
- `errors.ErrInvalid`: A function from the `go.flipt.io/flipt/errors` package, used to create "invalid input" errors.

## Symbols

### `Test_AdaptError`
#### Description
This function tests the `AdaptError` function by iterating through a set of test cases and asserting that the returned error matches the expected error type.

#### Inputs
- `t *testing.T`: The testing framework's testing object.

#### Outputs
- None. The function uses the testing framework's assertion methods to verify the expected behavior.

#### Internal Logic
The test function iterates through a slice of anonymous structs, each representing a test case. Each test case defines:
- `driver`: The database driver to test.
- `inputErr`: The input error to pass to `AdaptError`.
- `outputErrAs`: The expected error type after adaptation. If `nil`, the test expects the input error to be returned unchanged.

For each test case, the function:
1. Calls `AdaptError` with the specified driver and input error.
2. If `outputErrAs` is `nil`, asserts that the returned error is equal to the input error.
3. Otherwise, asserts that the returned error can be converted to the type specified by `outputErrAs` using `errors.As`.

## Dependencies
- `database/sql`: Standard library package for interacting with SQL databases.
- `fmt`: Standard library package for formatted I/O.
- `testing`: Standard library package for writing unit tests.
- `github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql`: MySQL driver for Go.
- `github.com/jackc/pgx/v5/pgconn`: PostgreSQL driver for Go.
- `github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3`: SQLite driver for Go.
- `github.com/stretchr/testify/require`: Assertion library for Go.
- `go.flipt.io/flipt/errors`: Flipt's internal error package.

## Error Handling
The test function itself doesn't implement error handling. It relies on the testing framework to catch and report any errors encountered during the test execution.
