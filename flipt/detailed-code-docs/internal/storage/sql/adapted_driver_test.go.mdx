title: "adapted_driver_test.go"
---

## High-level description
The code defines tests for the `adaptedDriver` and `adaptedConnector` types, which are used to connect to a SQL database using a generic interface. The tests cover both successful and unsuccessful connection scenarios.

## Code Structure
The `TestAdaptedDriver` function tests the `Open` method of the `adaptedDriver` type. The `TestAdaptedConnectorConnect` function tests the `Connect` method of the `adaptedConnector` type. Both functions use mock objects to simulate the behavior of the underlying database driver.

## Symbols
### `TestAdaptedDriver`
#### Description
This function tests the `Open` method of the `adaptedDriver` type. It has two subtests: "failure" and "success".

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| t | *testing.T | The testing object. |

#### Internal Logic
* **"failure" subtest:**
    * Mocks a database driver that returns an error when opening a connection.
    * Creates an `adaptedDriver` with the mocked driver.
    * Calls the `Open` method of the `adaptedDriver` and asserts that it returns an error.
* **"success" subtest:**
    * Mocks a database driver that successfully opens a connection.
    * Creates an `adaptedDriver` with the mocked driver.
    * Calls the `Open` method of the `adaptedDriver` and asserts that it returns a non-nil connection object.

### `TestAdaptedConnectorConnect`
#### Description
This function tests the `Connect` method of the `adaptedConnector` type. It has two subtests: "failure" and "success".

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| t | *testing.T | The testing object. |

#### Internal Logic
* **"failure" subtest:**
    * Mocks a database connector that returns a connection error.
    * Creates an `adaptedConnector` with the mocked connector.
    * Calls the `Connect` method of the `adaptedConnector` and asserts that it returns an error.
* **"success" subtest:**
    * Mocks a database connector that successfully connects.
    * Creates an `adaptedConnector` with the mocked connector.
    * Calls the `Connect` method of the `adaptedConnector` and asserts that it returns a non-nil connection object.
