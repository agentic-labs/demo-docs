title: "rollout.go"

## High-level description
The `rollout.go` file defines the storage implementation for managing feature rollouts in Flipt. It provides functions for creating, retrieving, updating, deleting, and listing rollouts associated with feature flags. 

Rollouts are used to gradually release features to users based on specific criteria, such as user segments or percentage-based thresholds. This file handles the persistence of rollout data, including their rules and configurations, in a SQL database.

## Code Structure
The `rollout.go` file defines several functions that interact with each other to manage rollouts in the Flipt system. Here's a brief overview of how they relate:

- `GetRollout`: Retrieves a specific rollout by its ID and namespace.
- `ListRollouts`: Fetches a list of rollouts based on provided criteria, such as flag key and namespace.
- `CountRollouts`: Counts the total number of rollouts for a given flag.
- `CreateRollout`: Creates a new rollout with its associated rule (segment-based or threshold-based).
- `UpdateRollout`: Modifies an existing rollout, including its description and rule.
- `DeleteRollout`: Removes a rollout and reorders the remaining rollouts for the associated flag.
- `OrderRollouts`: Reorders the rollouts for a specific flag.

These functions work together to provide a complete set of operations for managing feature rollouts within Flipt.

## References
This file references several other parts of the codebase, including:

- `go.flipt.io/flipt/internal/storage`: Defines the interface for interacting with the storage layer.
- `go.flipt.io/flipt/rpc/flipt`: Contains the protocol buffer definitions for Flipt's RPC API.
- `github.com/Masterminds/squirrel`: Used for building SQL queries.
- `github.com/gofrs/uuid`: Used for generating UUIDs.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if a rollout with the same rank already exists for the given flag.
2. Generates a new UUID for the rollout.
3. Begins a database transaction.
4. Inserts the rollout data into the `rollouts` table.
5. Based on the rollout rule type (segment or threshold):
    - Inserts the rule data into the corresponding table (`rollout_segments` or `rollout_percentages`).

- `encoding/json`: Used for JSON encoding and decoding.
- `errors`: Used for error handling.
- `fmt`: Used for formatted printing.

- `go.flipt.io/flipt/rpc/flipt`: Contains the protocol buffer definitions for Flipt's RPC API.

## Error Handling
The code uses the following error handling mechanisms:

- Returning errors from functions: Most functions return an `error` value, allowing for error propagation and handling at higher levels.
- Checking for specific error types: The code checks for specific error types, such as `sql.ErrNoRows`, to provide more informative error messages.
- Using custom error types: The code uses custom error types defined in the `go.flipt.io/flipt/errors` package, such as `errs.ErrNotFoundf`, to represent specific error conditions.

## Logging
The code does not implement any explicit logging mechanisms. However, it is likely that the `s.logger` field of the `Store` struct, which is passed to some functions, is used for logging purposes.
