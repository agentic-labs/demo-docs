## High-level description
The `evaluation_test.go` file contains unit tests for the evaluation package within the Flipt project. These tests cover various scenarios related to flag evaluation, including retrieving evaluation rules, distributions, and rollouts, and handling different flag types and namespaces.

## Code Structure
This file contains a test suite `DBTestSuite` with multiple test functions, each testing a specific aspect of the evaluation logic. The tests primarily interact with the `s.store` object, which represents a storage interface, to set up test data and verify the results of evaluation operations.

## References
This code references the following symbols from other parts of the codebase:

- `storage.Store` interface for interacting with the storage layer.
- `flipt.Flag` struct representing a feature flag.
- `flipt.EvaluationRequest` struct representing an evaluation request.
- `rpcevaluation.EvaluationResponse` struct representing an evaluation response.
- `rpcevaluation.VariantEvaluationResponse` struct representing a variant evaluation response.
- `rpcevaluation.BooleanEvaluationResponse` struct representing a boolean evaluation response.
- `storage.EvaluationRule` struct representing an evaluation rule.
- `storage.EvaluationDistribution` struct representing an evaluation distribution.
- `storage.EvaluationRollout` struct representing an evaluation rollout.

## Symbols

### `(s *DBTestSuite) TestGetEvaluationRules()`
#### Description
Tests the `GetEvaluationRules` function of the storage interface. It creates a flag, a segment with two constraints, and two rules associated with the flag and segment. It then calls `GetEvaluationRules` and asserts that the returned evaluation rules match the created data.

#### Inputs
This test function does not take any explicit inputs. It uses the `DBTestSuite` receiver to access the test setup.

#### Outputs
This test function does not return any explicit outputs. It uses the `assert` package to verify the expected behavior.

#### Internal Logic
- **Arrange:** Creates a flag, a segment with two constraints, and two rules associated with the flag and segment.
- **Act:** Calls the `GetEvaluationRules` function.
- **Assert:** Verifies that the returned evaluation rules match the created data, including the rule ID, namespace, flag key, segment key, match type, rank, and the number of constraints.

### `Benchmark_EvaluationV1AndV2(b *testing.B)`

#### Outputs
This function does not return any values. It uses the `b.Run` function to run sub-benchmarks and the `require` and `assert` packages to verify the expected behavior.

#### Internal Logic
- **Setup:**
    - Creates a new `DBTestSuite` and sets up the suite.
    - Creates a new `server.Server` and imports data from a YAML file.
    - Creates a new `evaluation.Server`.
    - Generates a list of flag keys.
- **Benchmarking:**
    - Runs benchmarks for `Evaluate` (v1), `Variant` (v2), and `Boolean` functions with different flag keys and entity IDs.
    - Measures the time taken for each evaluation.
- **Teardown:** Tears down the `DBTestSuite`.
