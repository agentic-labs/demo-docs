## High-level description
The `internal/storage/sql/fields.go` file defines custom data types and their corresponding SQL driver implementations for handling specific data formats within a SQL database. These custom types include `Timestamp`, `NullableTimestamp`, and `JSONField`.

## Code Structure
The code defines three custom types: `Timestamp`, `NullableTimestamp`, and `JSONField`. Each of these types implements the `sql.Scanner` and `driver.Valuer` interfaces for interacting with SQL databases.

## Symbols

### `Timestamp`
#### Description
The `Timestamp` type is a wrapper around `timestamppb.Timestamp` that implements the `sql.Scanner` and `driver.Valuer` interfaces for storing and retrieving timestamps with microsecond precision in a SQL database.

#### Inputs
This type doesn't have explicit input parameters. It interacts with SQL databases through the `Scan` and `Value` methods.

#### Outputs
This type doesn't have explicit output parameters. It interacts with SQL databases through the `Scan` and `Value` methods.

#### Internal Logic
- **`Scan(value interface{}) error`**: This method unmarshals a `time.Time` value from the database into the `Timestamp` struct. It performs validation on the timestamp to ensure its validity.
- **`Value() (driver.Value, error)`**: This method converts the `Timestamp` to a `time.Time` value suitable for storing in the database. It also performs validation before returning the value.

### `NullableTimestamp`
#### Description
The `NullableTimestamp` type is similar to `Timestamp` but handles nullable timestamp values in the database.

#### Inputs
This type doesn't have explicit input parameters. It interacts with SQL databases through the `Scan` and `Value` methods.

#### Outputs
This type doesn't have explicit output parameters. It interacts with SQL databases through the `Scan` and `Value` methods.

#### Internal Logic
- **`Scan(value interface{}) error`**: This method handles both `nil` values and `time.Time` values from the database. If the value is not `nil`, it performs the same validation and unmarshalling as `Timestamp`.
- **`Value() (driver.Value, error)`**: This method returns `nil` if the `Timestamp` is `nil`. Otherwise, it behaves the same way as the `Timestamp`'s `Value` method.

### `JSONField`
#### Description
The `JSONField` type is a generic type that implements the `sql.Scanner` and `driver.Valuer` interfaces for storing and retrieving any Go type as a JSON string in a SQL database.

#### Inputs
This type doesn't have explicit input parameters. It interacts with SQL databases through the `Scan` and `Value` methods.

#### Outputs
This type doesn't have explicit output parameters. It interacts with SQL databases through the `Scan` and `Value` methods.

#### Internal Logic
- **`Scan(v any) error`**: This method unmarshals a JSON string from the database into the generic type `T`. It handles both `[]byte` and `string` types for the database value.
- **`Value() (driver.Value, error)`**: This method marshals the generic type `T` into a JSON string suitable for storing in the database.

## Dependencies
- `"database/sql/driver"`: Provides interfaces for interacting with SQL databases.
- `"encoding/json"`: Provides functionality for JSON encoding and decoding.
- `"fmt"`: Provides formatted I/O functionality.
- `"time"`: Provides time-related functionality.
- `"google.golang.org/protobuf/types/known/timestamppb"`: Provides a standard representation for timestamps in Protobuf messages.

## Error Handling
The code uses basic error handling with `error` values returned from functions. The `fmt.Errorf` function is used to create specific error messages.
