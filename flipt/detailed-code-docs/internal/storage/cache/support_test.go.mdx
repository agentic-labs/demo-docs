## High-level description
The `cache/support_test.go` file defines two support types, `cacheMock` and `cacheSpy`, used for testing purposes within the `cache` package. These types implement the `cache.Cacher` interface, allowing them to be used in place of real cache implementations during tests.

## Code Structure
The `cacheMock` and `cacheSpy` types are independent of each other but both implement the `cache.Cacher` interface. They are used as test doubles to simulate and inspect the behavior of real cache implementations in tests.

## References
- `cache.Cacher`: This interface, defined in the `go.flipt.io/flipt/internal/cache` package, outlines the methods required for a cache implementation.

## Symbols

### Symbol Name: `cacheMock`

#### Description
The `cacheMock` struct is a mock implementation of the `cache.Cacher` interface. It allows for simulating different cache behaviors by setting specific fields like `cached`, `cachedValue`, `getErr`, and `setErr`.

#### Inputs
This struct doesn't have explicit input parameters. However, its behavior is controlled by setting its fields:
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| cached | bool | Determines if a Get operation should return a cached value or not. |
| cachedValue | []byte | The value to be returned on a successful Get operation when `cached` is true. |
| cacheKey | string | Stores the key used in the last Get or Set operation. |
| getErr | error | If set, this error is returned on a Get operation. |
| setErr | error | If set, this error is returned on a Set operation. |

#### Outputs
The `cacheMock` struct doesn't have explicit output parameters. Its output is determined by the values returned from its methods, which are controlled by its internal state.

#### Internal Logic
The `cacheMock` methods (`Get`, `Set`, `Delete`) are simple implementations that return predefined values or errors based on the struct's field values.

### Symbol Name: `cacheSpy`

#### Description
The `cacheSpy` struct is a spy implementation of the `cache.Cacher` interface. It wraps an existing `cache.Cacher` and records all calls made to its methods, including the keys and values used.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| c | cache.Cacher | The actual cache implementation being spied on. |

#### Outputs
The `cacheSpy` struct doesn't have explicit output parameters. Its output is the same as the wrapped `cache.Cacher`, but it also records the calls made to the cache.

#### Internal Logic
The `cacheSpy` methods (`Get`, `Set`, `Delete`) delegate the actual cache operations to the wrapped `cache.Cacher`. However, before and after each delegation, they record the operation details (keys, values, call counts) in their internal maps.

## Dependencies
- `context`: Provides functions for managing and propagating context information in concurrent programs.
- `go.flipt.io/flipt/internal/cache`: Defines the `cache.Cacher` interface.

## Error Handling
Both `cacheMock` and `cacheSpy` use Go's standard error handling mechanism. The `cacheMock` can be configured to return specific errors, while `cacheSpy` passes through any errors from the wrapped `cache.Cacher`.
