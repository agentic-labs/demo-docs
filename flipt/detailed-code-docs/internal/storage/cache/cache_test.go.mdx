## High-level description
The `cache_test.go` file contains unit tests for the `cache` package, specifically for the `NewStore` function which returns a `Store` implementation that utilizes a cache. The tests cover various scenarios, including handling marshaling/unmarshaling errors, cache hits and misses, and cache invalidation upon data modification.

## Code Structure
The code consists entirely of test functions, each testing a specific aspect of the `cachedStore`. Each test function sets up a mock store, a mock cache, and a logger, then creates a `cachedStore` using `NewStore`. The tests then interact with the `cachedStore` and assert expected behavior, including interactions with the mock store and cache.

## Symbols
### `TestSetJSON_HandleMarshalError`
#### Description
Tests that the `setJSON` function handles marshaling errors gracefully. It attempts to store a value that cannot be marshaled and verifies that the cache is not updated.

#### Internal Logic
- **Arrange:** Creates a mock store, a mock cache, and a logger.
- **Act:** Calls `setJSON` with a value that cannot be marshaled (a channel).
- **Assert:** Verifies that the `cacheKey` in the mock cache remains empty, indicating that no attempt was made to cache the value.

### `TestGetJSON_HandleGetError`
#### Description
Tests that the `getJSON` function handles errors encountered during cache retrieval.

#### Internal Logic
- **Arrange:** Creates a mock store, a mock cache that returns an error on `Get`, and a logger.
- **Act:** Calls `getJSON` to retrieve a value.
- **Assert:** Verifies that `cacheHit` is false, indicating that the cache was not hit due to the error.

### `TestGetJSON_HandleUnmarshalError`
#### Description
Tests that the `getJSON` function handles unmarshaling errors gracefully.

#### Internal Logic
- **Arrange:** Creates a mock store, a mock cache that returns invalid JSON data, and a logger.
- **Act:** Calls `getJSON` to retrieve a value.
- **Assert:** Verifies that `cacheHit` is false, indicating that the cache was not hit due to the unmarshaling error.

### `TestGetProtobuf_HandleGetError`
#### Description
Tests that the `getProtobuf` function handles errors encountered during cache retrieval.

#### Internal Logic
- **Arrange:** Creates a mock store, a mock cache that returns an error on `Get`, and a logger.
- **Act:** Calls `getProtobuf` to retrieve a value.
- **Assert:** Verifies that `cacheHit` is false, indicating that the cache was not hit due to the error.

### `TestGetProtobuf_HandleUnmarshalError`
#### Description
Tests that the `getProtobuf` function handles unmarshaling errors gracefully.

#### Internal Logic
- **Arrange:** Creates a mock store, a mock cache that returns invalid protobuf data, and a logger.
- **Act:** Calls `getProtobuf` to retrieve a value.
- **Assert:** Verifies that `cacheHit` is false, indicating that the cache was not hit due to the unmarshaling error.

### `TestGetEvaluationRules`
#### Description
Tests that the `GetEvaluationRules` function caches results and retrieves them from the cache on subsequent calls.

#### Internal Logic
- **Arrange:** Creates a mock store that returns a predefined set of evaluation rules, a memory cache, and a logger.
- **Act:**
    - Calls `GetEvaluationRules` for the first time.
    - Calls `GetEvaluationRules` again with the same arguments.
- **Assert:**
    - Verifies that the first call retrieves data from the mock store and caches it.
    - Verifies that the second call retrieves data from the cache and does not interact with the mock store.

### `TestGetEvaluationRollouts`
#### Description
Tests that the `GetEvaluationRollouts` function caches results and retrieves them from the cache on subsequent calls.

#### Internal Logic
- **Arrange:** Creates a mock store that returns a predefined set of evaluation rollouts, a memory cache, and a logger.
- **Act:**
    - Calls `GetEvaluationRollouts` for the first time.
    - Calls `GetEvaluationRollouts` again with the same arguments.
- **Assert:**
    - Verifies that the first call retrieves data from the mock store and caches it.
    - Verifies that the second call retrieves data from the cache and does not interact with the mock store.

### `TestGetFlag`
#### Description
Tests that the `GetFlag` function caches results and retrieves them from the cache on subsequent calls.

#### Internal Logic
- **Arrange:** Creates a mock store that returns a predefined flag, a memory cache, and a logger.
- **Act:**
    - Calls `GetFlag` for the first time.
    - Calls `GetFlag` again with the same arguments.
- **Assert:**
    - Verifies that the first call retrieves data from the mock store and caches it.
    - Verifies that the second call retrieves data from the cache and does not interact with the mock store.

### `TestCreateFlag`
#### Description
Tests that the `CreateFlag` function invalidates the cache for the relevant flag.

#### Internal Logic
- **Arrange:** Creates a mock store, a memory cache, and a logger.
- **Act:** Calls `CreateFlag` to create a new flag.
- **Assert:** Verifies that the cache for the created flag is deleted, ensuring that subsequent reads retrieve the updated data from the store.

### `TestUpdateFlag`
#### Description
Tests that the `UpdateFlag` function invalidates the cache for the relevant flag.

#### Internal Logic
- **Arrange:** Creates a mock store, a memory cache, and a logger.
- **Act:** Calls `UpdateFlag` to update an existing flag.
- **Assert:** Verifies that the cache for the updated flag is deleted, ensuring that subsequent reads retrieve the updated data from the store.

### `TestDeleteFlag`
#### Description
Tests that the `DeleteFlag` function invalidates the cache for the relevant flag.

#### Internal Logic
- **Arrange:** Creates a mock store, a memory cache, and a logger.
- **Act:** Calls `DeleteFlag` to delete an existing flag.
- **Assert:** Verifies that the cache for the deleted flag is deleted, ensuring that subsequent reads do not retrieve stale data from the cache.

### `TestCreateVariant`
#### Description
Tests that the `CreateVariant` function invalidates the cache for the relevant flag.

#### Internal Logic
- **Arrange:** Creates a mock store, a memory cache, and a logger.
- **Act:** Calls `CreateVariant` to create a new variant for a flag.
- **Assert:** Verifies that the cache for the relevant flag is deleted, ensuring that subsequent reads retrieve the updated data from the store.

### `TestUpdateVariant`
#### Description
Tests that the `UpdateVariant` function invalidates the cache for the relevant flag.

#### Internal Logic
- **Arrange:** Creates a mock store, a memory cache, and a logger.
- **Act:** Calls `UpdateVariant` to update an existing variant for a flag.
- **Assert:** Verifies that the cache for the relevant flag is deleted, ensuring that subsequent reads retrieve the updated data from the store.

### `TestDeleteVariant`
#### Description
Tests that the `DeleteVariant` function invalidates the cache for the relevant flag.

#### Internal Logic
- **Arrange:** Creates a mock store, a memory cache, and a logger.
- **Act:** Calls `DeleteVariant` to delete an existing variant for a flag.
- **Assert:** Verifies that the cache for the relevant flag is deleted, ensuring that subsequent reads retrieve the updated data from the store.
