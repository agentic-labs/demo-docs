## High-level description
The `internal/gitfs` directory contains an implementation of a read-only filesystem interface that interacts with Git repositories. This package provides a way to access files and directories from a Git repository as if they were part of a local filesystem, implementing the `fs.FS` interface from Go's standard library.

## What does it do?
The `gitfs` package allows developers to:
1. Create a filesystem representation of a Git repository.
2. Open and read files from specific commits or branches without fully cloning the repository.
3. Navigate through the directory structure of a Git repository.
4. Retrieve file metadata such as size, mode, and modification time.
5. Handle Git submodules as part of the filesystem structure.

This functionality is particularly useful for applications that need to read files from Git repositories efficiently, without the overhead of a full clone operation.

## Key Files

### gitfs.go
This file contains the core implementation of the `gitfs` package. It defines the following key components:

1. `FS` struct: Represents the filesystem and implements the `fs.FS` interface.
2. `File` struct: Represents a file in the Git repository.
3. `Dir` struct: Represents a directory in the Git repository.
4. `FileInfo` struct: Contains metadata about files and directories.
5. `DirEntry` struct: Represents an entry within a directory.

The file also includes functions for creating new `FS` instances from Git repositories, opening files and directories, and handling file operations like reading and seeking.

### gitfs_test.go
This file contains unit tests for the `gitfs` package. It includes:

1. `Test_FS`: A test suite that verifies various aspects of the filesystem implementation, such as opening files, reading contents, and walking the directory structure.
2. `Test_FS_Submodule`: A specific test for handling Git submodules.
3. `testdataRepo`: A helper function for creating test Git repositories from embedded test data.

The tests cover scenarios like handling invalid paths, verifying file contents, testing directory traversal, and ensuring proper behavior with submodules.

## Dependencies
The `gitfs` package relies on several external libraries:

1. `github.com/go-git/go-git/v5`: Used for interacting with Git repositories. This library provides the core functionality for working with Git objects, references, and storage.

2. `io/fs`: From the Go standard library, this package defines interfaces for filesystem operations. The `gitfs` package implements these interfaces to provide a filesystem-like view of Git repositories.

3. `go.uber.org/zap`: Used for logging within the package. It provides a fast, structured logging solution.

4. Testing dependencies:
   - `github.com/stretchr/testify/assert` and `github.com/stretchr/testify/require`: Provide assertion functions for more expressive and readable tests.
   - `github.com/go-git/go-billy/v5/memfs`: Used in tests to provide an in-memory filesystem implementation.

## Configuration
The `gitfs` package doesn't use explicit configuration files. However, it does provide options for customizing the behavior when creating a new `FS` instance:

1. `Options` struct: Allows specifying a Git reference (e.g., branch or tag) to use when creating the filesystem.
2. `WithReference` function: A helper function to set the reference option.

These options can be used when calling `NewFromRepo` to create an `FS` instance from a Git repository.

In summary, the `internal/gitfs` package provides a powerful abstraction for working with Git repositories as filesystems. It allows developers to easily read files and navigate directory structures from specific Git commits or branches without needing to fully clone repositories. This can be particularly useful in scenarios where efficient, read-only access to Git repository contents is required.
