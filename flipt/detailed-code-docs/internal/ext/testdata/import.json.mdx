## High-level description
This JSON file defines a configuration for feature flags and user segments. It contains two feature flags with different types (variant and boolean) and one user segment with a constraint. This structure is typically used in feature flag management systems to control feature rollouts and user targeting.

## Symbols

### Root Object
#### Description
The root object contains two main arrays: `flags` and `segments`, which define the feature flags and user segments respectively.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| flags | array | An array of feature flag objects |
| segments | array | An array of user segment objects |

### Flag Object
#### Description
Represents a feature flag with its properties, variants (for variant flags), and rules or rollouts (depending on the flag type).

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| key | string | Unique identifier for the flag |
| name | string | Display name of the flag |
| type | string | Type of the flag (e.g., "VARIANT_FLAG_TYPE" or "BOOLEAN_FLAG_TYPE") |
| description | string | Description of the flag's purpose |
| enabled | boolean | Whether the flag is globally enabled or disabled |
| variants | array | (Optional) Array of variant objects for variant flags |
| rules | array | (Optional) Array of rule objects for variant flags |
| rollouts | array | (Optional) Array of rollout objects for boolean flags |

### Variant Object
#### Description
Defines a variant option for a variant flag, including its properties and an attachment with additional data.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| key | string | Unique identifier for the variant |
| name | string | Display name of the variant |
| description | string | Description of the variant |
| default | boolean | Whether this is the default variant |
| attachment | object | Additional data associated with the variant |

### Rule Object
#### Description
Defines targeting rules for a variant flag, specifying which segment and variant to use, and the rollout percentage.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| segment | string | Key of the segment to target |
| rank | number | Priority of the rule |
| distributions | array | Array of distribution objects specifying variant and rollout percentage |

### Rollout Object
#### Description
Defines rollout rules for a boolean flag, either targeting a specific segment or using a percentage-based threshold.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| description | string | Description of the rollout rule |
| segment | object | (Optional) Segment targeting information |
| threshold | object | (Optional) Percentage-based threshold for the rollout |

### Segment Object
#### Description
Defines a user segment with its properties and constraints for targeting specific users.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| key | string | Unique identifier for the segment |
| name | string | Display name of the segment |
| match_type | string | Type of matching to use for constraints (e.g., "ANY_MATCH_TYPE") |
| description | string | Description of the segment's purpose |
| constraints | array | Array of constraint objects defining targeting rules |

### Constraint Object
#### Description
Defines a specific targeting rule for a segment based on user properties.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| type | string | Type of comparison to perform (e.g., "STRING_COMPARISON_TYPE") |
| property | string | User property to evaluate |
| operator | string | Comparison operator to use (e.g., "neq" for not equal) |
| value | string | Value to compare against |

## Dependencies
This JSON file doesn't have direct dependencies, but it's likely used by a feature flag management system that interprets and applies these configurations.

## Configuration
The entire JSON file serves as a configuration for feature flags and user segments. The structure allows for flexible definition of different flag types, targeting rules, and user segments.
