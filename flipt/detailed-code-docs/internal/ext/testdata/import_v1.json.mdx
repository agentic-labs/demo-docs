## High-level description
This JSON file represents a configuration for feature flags and segments in a feature management system. It defines a single feature flag with one variant and a rule, as well as a segment with a constraint for targeting specific users or environments.

## Code Structure
The JSON structure consists of three main sections: version, flags, and segments. The flags section contains an array of feature flag configurations, while the segments section defines user segments for targeting.

## Symbols

| segment | string | The key of the segment this rule applies to |
| rank | number | The priority of the rule |
| distributions | array | Array of distribution configurations for variants |

### Segment Object
#### Description

### Constraint Object
#### Description
Specifies a single constraint for a segment, defining how to match users or environments.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| type | string | The type of comparison to perform |
| property | string | The property to evaluate |
| operator | string | The comparison operator to use |

## Dependencies
This JSON file does not have any external dependencies as it is a data configuration file.

## Configuration
The entire file serves as a configuration for a feature management system. The main configuration options are:

| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| version | string | Specifies the version of the configuration format |
| flags | array | Defines the feature flags and their settings |
| segments | array | Defines the user segments for targeting |

## API/Interface Reference
While this is not an API definition, it represents a data structure that could be used by an API. The main structures are:

| Structure | Description |
|:----------|:------------|
| Flag | Represents a feature flag with its variants and rules |
| Segment | Defines a user segment for targeting |
| Variant | Specifies a variant of a feature flag |
| Rule | Defines targeting rules for a feature flag |
| Constraint | Specifies criteria for segment matching |

This JSON structure could be used as input for creating or updating feature flags and segments in a feature management system, or as output when retrieving the current configuration.
