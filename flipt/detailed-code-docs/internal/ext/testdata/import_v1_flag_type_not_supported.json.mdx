---

## High-level description
This JSON file represents a configuration for feature flags in a software system. It defines a single flag with an unsupported flag type, likely used for testing purposes to handle cases where imported flag types are not recognized or supported by the system.

### JSON Structure
#### Description
The JSON structure defines a configuration for feature flags, including version information and an array of flag definitions.

#### Internal Logic
The file contains a JSON object with two main properties:
1. `version`: Specifies the version of the configuration format.
2. `flags`: An array containing flag definitions.

Each flag in the `flags` array is defined with the following properties:
- `key`: A unique identifier for the flag.
- `name`: The display name of the flag.
- `type`: The type of the flag, which in this case is an unsupported type.
- `description`: A brief explanation of the flag's purpose.
- `enabled`: A boolean indicating whether the flag is active or not.

### Flag Definition
#### Description
The file defines a single feature flag with an unsupported flag type.

#### Internal Logic
The flag is defined with the following properties:
- `key`: "flag1"
- `name`: "flag1"
- `type`: "VARIANT_FLAG_TYPE" (an unsupported type)
- `description`: "description"
- `enabled`: true

The use of "VARIANT_FLAG_TYPE" as the flag type is likely intentional for testing purposes, as it represents a type that is not typically supported in standard feature flag systems.

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Value | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------|:------------|
| version | string | "1.0" | Specifies the version of the configuration format |

## Error Handling
This file is likely used to test error handling in a system that imports feature flag configurations. The unsupported flag type ("VARIANT_FLAG_TYPE") would typically trigger error handling or fallback mechanisms in the importing system.

## TODOs
While there are no explicit TODOs in the file, the presence of an unsupported flag type suggests that this file is intended for testing purposes. Developers working with this file should be aware that it's designed to test edge cases or error handling in flag import processes.
