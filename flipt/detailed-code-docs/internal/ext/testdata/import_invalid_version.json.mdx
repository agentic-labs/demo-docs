## High-level description
This JSON file represents an invalid version configuration for an import operation. It specifies a version number and a namespace, but the version number is not valid for the intended use case.

### JSON Object
#### Description
The file contains a single JSON object with two key-value pairs:
1. "version": Specifies the version number as a string.
2. "namespace": Specifies the namespace as a string.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| version | string | The version number of the import configuration |
| namespace | string | The namespace for the import operation |

## Dependencies
This file does not have any external dependencies. It is a standalone JSON configuration file.

## Configuration
The file defines the following configuration options:
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| version | string | "5.0" | Specifies the version number for the import configuration |
| namespace | string | "default" | Specifies the namespace for the import operation |

## Error Handling
This file is likely used in a test scenario to validate error handling in the importing system. The version "5.0" is probably an invalid version number, which should trigger an error when processed by the import functionality.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in this file. However, it's worth noting that this file is located in a "testdata" directory, suggesting it's used for testing purposes, specifically to test how the system handles invalid version numbers during import operations.
