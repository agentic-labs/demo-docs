## High-level description
This YAML file defines configuration for feature flags and segments. It includes two flags with different types and configurations, as well as a segment definition with constraints.

## Symbols

### flags
#### Description
An array of feature flag configurations.

#### Internal Logic
Each flag in the array contains properties such as key, name, type, description, enabled status, and additional configuration depending on the flag type.

___

### flag1
#### Description
A variant-type feature flag with a single variant and rule.

#### Internal Logic
- Defines a flag of type "VARIANT_FLAG_TYPE"
- Includes a single variant with an attachment containing various data types
- Specifies a rule for segment-based distribution

___

### flag2
#### Description
A boolean-type feature flag with rollout configurations.

#### Internal Logic
- Defines a flag of type "BOOLEAN_FLAG_TYPE"
- Includes two rollout configurations:
  1. Enabled for internal users based on a segment
  2. Enabled for 50% of users based on a threshold

___

### segments
#### Description
An array of segment definitions used for targeting specific user groups.

#### Internal Logic
Defines a single segment with a match type and constraint.

___

### segment1
#### Description
A segment definition with a string comparison constraint.

#### Internal Logic
- Uses "ANY_MATCH_TYPE" for matching
- Defines a constraint comparing the "fizz" property to the value "buzz" using a not-equal operator

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| key | string | Unique identifier for flags and segments |
| name | string | Display name for flags and segments |
| type | string | Type of the flag (e.g., "VARIANT_FLAG_TYPE", "BOOLEAN_FLAG_TYPE") |
| description | string | Detailed description of the flag or segment |
| enabled | boolean | Whether the flag is enabled or not |
| variants | array | List of variants for a variant-type flag |
| rules | array | Distribution rules for variants |
| rollouts | array | Rollout configurations for boolean flags |
| match_type | string | Type of matching for segments (e.g., "ANY_MATCH_TYPE") |
| constraints | array | List of constraints for segments |

This YAML configuration file provides a structured way to define feature flags and segments for a feature management system. It allows for fine-grained control over feature rollouts and targeting specific user groups.
