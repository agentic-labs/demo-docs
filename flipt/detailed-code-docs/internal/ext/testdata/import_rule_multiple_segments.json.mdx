## High-level description
This JSON file defines a configuration for feature flags and user segments. It includes two flags with different types and rules, as well as a segment definition with constraints. This structure is typically used in feature flag management systems to control feature rollouts and user targeting.

## Symbols

### Root Object
#### Description
The root object contains two main arrays: `flags` and `segments`, which define the feature flags and user segments respectively.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| flags | array | An array of feature flag objects |
| segments | array | An array of segment objects |

### Flag Object
#### Description
Represents a feature flag with its properties, variants, and rules.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| key | string | Unique identifier for the flag |
| name | string | Display name of the flag |
| type | string | Type of the flag (e.g., "VARIANT_FLAG_TYPE", "BOOLEAN_FLAG_TYPE") |
| description | string | Description of the flag's purpose |
| enabled | boolean | Whether the flag is currently enabled |
| variants | array | (Optional) Array of variant objects for VARIANT_FLAG_TYPE |
| rules | array | (Optional) Array of rule objects for flag targeting |
| rollouts | array | (Optional) Array of rollout objects for BOOLEAN_FLAG_TYPE |

### Variant Object
#### Description
Defines a variant of a feature flag, including its properties and attachment data.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| key | string | Unique identifier for the variant |
| name | string | Display name of the variant |
| description | string | Description of the variant |
| attachment | object | Additional data associated with the variant |

### Rule Object
#### Description
Defines targeting rules for a feature flag, including segment targeting and distribution.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| segment | object | Segment targeting information |
| distributions | array | Array of distribution objects |

### Rollout Object
#### Description
Defines rollout rules for boolean flags, including targeting and thresholds.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| description | string | Description of the rollout rule |
| segment | object | (Optional) Segment targeting information |
| threshold | object | (Optional) Percentage-based rollout threshold |

### Segment Object
#### Description
Defines a user segment with its properties and constraints.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| key | string | Unique identifier for the segment |
| name | string | Display name of the segment |
| match_type | string | Type of matching for the segment (e.g., "ANY_MATCH_TYPE") |
| description | string | Description of the segment's purpose |
| constraints | array | Array of constraint objects defining segment rules |

### Constraint Object
#### Description
Defines a constraint for a segment, specifying the condition for user inclusion.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| type | string | Type of constraint (e.g., "STRING_COMPARISON_TYPE") |
| property | string | User property to evaluate |
| operator | string | Comparison operator (e.g., "neq" for not equal) |
| value | string | Value to compare against |

## Dependencies
This JSON structure doesn't directly depend on external libraries, but it's likely used in conjunction with a feature flag management system that can interpret and apply these configurations.

## Configuration
The entire JSON file serves as a configuration for feature flags and segments. The structure allows for flexible definition of flags, variants, rules, and segments to control feature rollouts and user targeting.

## API/Interface Reference
While this JSON file doesn't define an API directly, it represents a data structure that could be consumed by a feature flag management API. The structure supports:

1. Defining feature flags with variants and rules
2. Creating user segments with constraints
3. Specifying rollout strategies for boolean flags

This configuration could be used to determine feature availability and variants for different users based on their properties and the defined segments and rules.
