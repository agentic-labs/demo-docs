## High-level description
This YAML file defines feature flags and segments for a feature flagging system. It includes two flags with different types and configurations, as well as a segment definition with constraints.

## Symbols

### `flags`
#### Description
An array of feature flag definitions, each containing various properties and configurations.

#### Internal Logic
Each flag in the array has the following structure:
- `key`: Unique identifier for the flag
- `name`: Human-readable name for the flag
- `type`: Type of the flag (e.g., "VARIANT_FLAG_TYPE" or "BOOLEAN_FLAG_TYPE")
- `description`: Brief description of the flag's purpose
- `enabled`: Boolean indicating whether the flag is active
- Additional properties depending on the flag type (variants, rules, rollouts)

### `flag1`
#### Description
A variant-type feature flag with a single variant and associated rules.

#### Internal Logic
- Defines a variant named "variant1" with an attachment containing various data types
- Includes a rule for "segment1" with 100% rollout for the defined variant

### `flag2`
#### Description
A boolean-type feature flag with rollout configurations.

#### Internal Logic
- Defines two rollout configurations:
  1. Enabled for internal users based on a segment
  2. Enabled for 50% of users based on a threshold

### `segments`
#### Description
An array of segment definitions used for targeting specific user groups.

#### Internal Logic
Defines a single segment "segment1" with the following properties:
- `key`: Unique identifier for the segment
- `name`: Human-readable name for the segment
- `match_type`: Specifies how constraints should be applied ("ANY_MATCH_TYPE")
- `description`: Brief description of the segment's purpose
- `constraints`: Array of conditions used to determine segment membership

### `segment1`
#### Description
A segment definition with a single constraint for targeting users.

#### Internal Logic
Defines a constraint of type "STRING_COMPARISON_TYPE" that checks if the "fizz" property is not equal to "buzz".

## Configuration
This YAML file serves as a configuration for a feature flagging system. It defines the following main components:

| Component | Description |
|:----------|:------------|
| flags     | Array of feature flag definitions |
| segments  | Array of segment definitions for targeting |

Each flag and segment has its own set of configuration options, as detailed in their respective sections above.

Note: This file appears to be a test data file (`testdata` directory), likely used for testing import functionality or as an example configuration.
