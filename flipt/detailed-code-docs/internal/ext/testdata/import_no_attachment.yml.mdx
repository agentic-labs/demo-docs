## High-level description
This YAML file defines feature flags and segments for a feature flagging system. It includes two flags with different configurations and a segment with specific matching criteria.

## Symbols

### `flags`
#### Description
An array of feature flag configurations.

#### Internal Logic
Each flag in the array contains properties such as key, name, description, enabled status, and rules for flag distribution.

___

### `flag1`
#### Description
A feature flag with a single variant and a rule for distribution.

#### Internal Logic
- Enabled by default
- Has one variant named "variant1"
- Includes a rule that applies the flag to "segment1" with 100% rollout for "variant1"

___

### `flag2`
#### Description
A boolean feature flag with rollout rules based on segments and thresholds.

#### Internal Logic
- Disabled by default
- Type is explicitly set to "BOOLEAN_FLAG_TYPE"
- Has two rollout rules:
  1. Enabled for users in the "internal_users" segment
  2. Enabled for 50% of users not matching the first rule

___

### `segments`
#### Description
An array of segment definitions used for targeting specific user groups.

#### Internal Logic
Contains one segment named "segment1" with a constraint based on string comparison.

___

### `segment1`
#### Description
A segment definition with a string comparison constraint.

#### Internal Logic
- Match type is set to "ANY_MATCH_TYPE"
- Has a constraint that checks if the "fizz" property is not equal to "buzz"

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| key | string | N/A | Unique identifier for flags and segments |
| name | string | N/A | Human-readable name for flags and segments |
| description | string | N/A | Detailed description of the flag or segment |
| enabled | boolean | N/A | Indicates whether a flag is active |
| type | string | N/A | Specifies the flag type (e.g., "BOOLEAN_FLAG_TYPE") |
| match_type | string | N/A | Defines how segment constraints are evaluated |

## API/Interface Reference
While this is not an API definition, the structure implies the following data model for interacting with feature flags:

| Entity | Properties | Description |
|:-------|:-----------|:------------|
| Flag | key, name, description, enabled, variants, rules/rollouts | Defines a feature flag and its behavior |
| Segment | key, name, match_type, description, constraints | Defines a user segment for targeting |
| Variant | key, name, description | Defines a variation of a feature flag |
| Rule/Rollout | segment/threshold, rank, distributions/value | Defines how a flag is distributed to users |
| Constraint | type, property, operator, value | Defines criteria for segment membership |

This YAML structure could be used as a configuration file for a feature flagging system, allowing for fine-grained control over feature releases and user targeting.
