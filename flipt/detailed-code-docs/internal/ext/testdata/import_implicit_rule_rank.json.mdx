## High-level description
This JSON file contains configuration data for feature flags and segments. It defines two flags with different types and rules, as well as a segment with constraints. This structure is typically used in feature flag management systems to control the rollout of features to different user groups.

## Symbols

### Root Object
#### Description
The root object contains two main arrays: `flags` and `segments`. These arrays define the feature flags and user segments used in the system.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| flags | array | An array of feature flag objects |
| segments | array | An array of segment objects |

### Flag Object
#### Description
Represents a feature flag with its properties, variants, and rules.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| key | string | Unique identifier for the flag |
| name | string | Human-readable name of the flag |
| type | string | Type of the flag (e.g., "VARIANT_FLAG_TYPE", "BOOLEAN_FLAG_TYPE") |
| description | string | Description of the flag's purpose |
| enabled | boolean | Whether the flag is currently enabled |
| variants | array | (Optional) Array of variant objects for VARIANT_FLAG_TYPE |
| rules | array | (Optional) Array of rule objects for flag distribution |
| rollouts | array | (Optional) Array of rollout objects for BOOLEAN_FLAG_TYPE |

### Variant Object
#### Description
Defines a variant of a feature flag, including its properties and attachments.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| key | string | Unique identifier for the variant |
| name | string | Human-readable name of the variant |
| description | string | Description of the variant |
| attachment | object | Additional data associated with the variant |

### Rule Object
#### Description
Defines a rule for distributing a flag variant to a specific segment.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| segment | string | Key of the segment to which the rule applies |
| distributions | array | Array of distribution objects |

### Distribution Object
#### Description
Specifies the rollout percentage for a variant within a rule.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| variant | string | Key of the variant being distributed |
| rollout | number | Percentage of users who should receive this variant |

### Rollout Object
#### Description
Defines a rollout strategy for a boolean flag.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| description | string | Description of the rollout strategy |
| segment | object | (Optional) Segment information for the rollout |
| threshold | object | (Optional) Threshold information for the rollout |

### Segment Object
#### Description
Defines a user segment with its properties and constraints.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| key | string | Unique identifier for the segment |
| name | string | Human-readable name of the segment |
| match_type | string | Type of matching to use for the segment (e.g., "ANY_MATCH_TYPE") |
| description | string | Description of the segment's purpose |
| constraints | array | Array of constraint objects defining the segment's rules |

### Constraint Object
#### Description
Defines a constraint for a segment, specifying a condition that must be met.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| type | string | Type of comparison to perform (e.g., "STRING_COMPARISON_TYPE") |
| property | string | The property to evaluate in the constraint |
| operator | string | The comparison operator to use (e.g., "neq" for not equal) |
| value | string | The value to compare against |

## Dependencies
This JSON file does not have any external dependencies. It is a self-contained configuration file.

## Configuration
The file itself serves as a configuration for a feature flag system. It defines two flags and one segment:

1. "flag1": A variant flag with one variant and one rule.
2. "flag2": A boolean flag with two rollout strategies.
3. "segment1": A segment with one string comparison constraint.

These configurations would be used by a feature flag management system to determine which features or variants to show to different users based on the defined rules and segments.
