## High-level description
This JSON file contains configuration data for feature flags and segments. It defines two flags with different structures and a segment with constraints, which are likely used for feature toggling and user segmentation in a software application.

## Symbols

### Root Object
#### Description
The root object of the JSON file contains two main arrays: `flags` and `segments`.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| flags | array | An array of feature flag objects |
| segments | array | An array of segment objects |

### Flag Objects
#### Description
Each flag object in the `flags` array represents a feature flag with its properties and rules.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| key | string | Unique identifier for the flag |
| name | string | Display name of the flag |
| description | string | Description of the flag's purpose |
| enabled | boolean | Whether the flag is enabled or not |
| variants | array | (Optional) Array of variant objects for the flag |
| rules | array | (Optional) Array of rule objects for the flag |
| type | string | (Optional) Type of the flag (e.g., "BOOLEAN_FLAG_TYPE") |
| rollouts | array | (Optional) Array of rollout objects for the flag |

### Variant Objects
#### Description
Variant objects define different variations of a feature flag.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| key | string | Unique identifier for the variant |
| name | string | Display name of the variant |
| description | string | Description of the variant |

### Rule Objects
#### Description
Rule objects define how a flag should be applied based on segments and distributions.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| segment | string | The segment key to which this rule applies |
| rank | number | The priority of the rule |
| distributions | array | Array of distribution objects |

### Distribution Objects
#### Description
Distribution objects define how variants are rolled out within a rule.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| variant | string | The variant key to be distributed |
| rollout | number | The percentage of users who should receive this variant |

### Rollout Objects
#### Description
Rollout objects define how a boolean flag is rolled out to different user groups.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| description | string | Description of the rollout condition |
| segment | object | (Optional) Segment object for the rollout |
| threshold | object | (Optional) Threshold object for the rollout |

### Segment Objects
#### Description
Segment objects define groups of users based on certain criteria.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| key | string | Unique identifier for the segment |
| name | string | Display name of the segment |
| match_type | string | Type of matching to be used (e.g., "ANY_MATCH_TYPE") |
| description | string | Description of the segment |
| constraints | array | Array of constraint objects |

### Constraint Objects
#### Description
Constraint objects define the criteria for including users in a segment.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| type | string | Type of comparison (e.g., "STRING_COMPARISON_TYPE") |
| property | string | The property to be compared |
| operator | string | The comparison operator (e.g., "neq") |
| value | string | The value to compare against |

## Dependencies
This JSON file does not have any external dependencies. It is a self-contained configuration file.

## Configuration
The file itself serves as a configuration for feature flags and segments. The structure of the JSON defines how flags and segments are configured in the system.

## Error Handling
As this is a JSON configuration file, there is no explicit error handling. However, the system consuming this file should validate its structure and content to ensure it conforms to the expected schema.

## API/Interface Reference
While this file doesn't define an API directly, it represents a data structure that could be used by an API for feature flag management. The structure of the flags and segments could inform the design of API endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting feature flags and segments.
