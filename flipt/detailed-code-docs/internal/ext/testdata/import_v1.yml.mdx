## High-level description
The code defines a YAML file containing test data for an import process, likely for feature flags or A/B testing configuration. It includes definitions for flags, variants, segments, and their associated properties like descriptions, rules, and constraints.

## Code Structure
The YAML file structures the data hierarchically. At the top level, it defines `version` and `flags`. Each flag can have multiple `variants`, and each variant can have an `attachment` with various data types. The file also defines `segments` with `constraints` for targeting specific user groups.

## Symbols
### `flags`
#### Description
Defines a list of feature flags, each with its configuration.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a top-level key in the YAML file.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is data, not a function.

#### Internal Logic
Each flag entry contains:
- `key`: Unique identifier for the flag.
- `name`: Display name of the flag.
- `description`: Description of the flag's purpose.
- `enabled`: Boolean indicating if the flag is active.
- `variants`: List of variant configurations for the flag.
- `rules`: Rules defining how variants are applied to segments.

### `variants`
#### Description
Defines variations within a feature flag, each with specific configurations.

#### Inputs
N/A - Nested within `flags`.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is data, not a function.

#### Internal Logic
Each variant entry contains:
- `key`: Unique identifier for the variant.
- `name`: Display name of the variant.
- `description`: Description of the variant.
- `attachment`: Optional data associated with the variant, containing various data types like numbers, booleans, strings, lists, and nested objects.

### `segments`
#### Description
Defines user segments based on specific criteria.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a top-level key in the YAML file.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is data, not a function.

#### Internal Logic
Each segment entry contains:
- `key`: Unique identifier for the segment.
- `name`: Display name of the segment.
- `match_type`: Defines how constraints are evaluated for segment membership.
- `description`: Description of the segment.
- `constraints`: List of conditions that determine segment membership.

### `constraints`
#### Description
Defines rules for segment membership based on user properties.

#### Inputs
N/A - Nested within `segments`.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is data, not a function.

#### Internal Logic
Each constraint entry contains:
- `type`: Type of comparison to perform.
- `property`: User property to evaluate.
- `operator`: Comparison operator (e.g., `neq` for "not equal").
- `value`: Value to compare against the user property.
