## High-level description
This JSON file contains feature flag configurations for two namespaces: "foo" and the default namespace. It defines flags, segments, and their associated rules, variants, and constraints for a feature flagging system.

## Code Structure
The file consists of two JSON objects, each representing a namespace configuration. The first object has an explicit "namespace" field set to "foo", while the second object represents the default namespace (without a specified namespace field).

## Symbols

### Namespace "foo"
#### Description
This JSON object defines the configuration for the "foo" namespace, including flags and segments.

#### Internal Logic
The namespace "foo" contains two flags ("flag1" and "flag2") and one segment ("segment1"). Each flag has its own configuration, including type, description, enabled status, and associated rules or rollouts.

### Default Namespace
#### Description
This JSON object defines the configuration for the default namespace, including flags and segments.

#### Internal Logic
The default namespace contains two flags ("flag3" and "flag4") and one segment ("segment2"). Similar to the "foo" namespace, each flag has its own configuration.

### Flags
#### Description
Flags represent feature toggles or switches that can be used to control the behavior of an application.

#### Internal Logic
Each flag has the following properties:
- key: A unique identifier for the flag
- name: A human-readable name for the flag
- type: The type of flag (e.g., "VARIANT_FLAG_TYPE" or "BOOLEAN_FLAG_TYPE")
- description: A brief description of the flag's purpose
- enabled: A boolean indicating whether the flag is currently active
- variants (for VARIANT_FLAG_TYPE): Possible variations of the flag
- rules (for VARIANT_FLAG_TYPE): Rules for distributing variants
- rollouts (for BOOLEAN_FLAG_TYPE): Conditions for enabling the flag

### Segments
#### Description
Segments define groups of users or conditions that can be used in flag rules and rollouts.

#### Internal Logic
Each segment has the following properties:
- key: A unique identifier for the segment
- name: A human-readable name for the segment
- match_type: The type of matching to be used (e.g., "ANY_MATCH_TYPE")
- description: A brief description of the segment's purpose
- constraints: An array of conditions that define the segment

## Dependencies
This JSON file is likely used as test data for a feature flagging system. It doesn't have direct dependencies, but it implies the existence of a system that can parse and utilize this configuration.

## Configuration
The file itself serves as a configuration for a feature flagging system. It defines the structure and properties of flags and segments across different namespaces.

## Error Handling
As a JSON data file, it doesn't implement error handling. However, the system consuming this data should validate the JSON structure and handle any parsing errors.

## API/Interface Reference
While this file doesn't define an API directly, it represents the data structure that might be returned by a feature flag management API. The structure implies the following endpoints might exist in such an API:

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:------------|
| /namespaces | GET | Retrieve all namespace configurations |
| /namespaces/{namespace}/flags | GET | Retrieve all flags for a specific namespace |
| /namespaces/{namespace}/segments | GET | Retrieve all segments for a specific namespace |

Note: The actual API endpoints would depend on the specific implementation of the feature flagging system using this data structure.
