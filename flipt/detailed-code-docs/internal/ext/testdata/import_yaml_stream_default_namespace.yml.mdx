## High-level description
This YAML file contains configuration data for feature flags and segments. It defines multiple flags with various types, rules, and rollout strategies, as well as segments with matching criteria. The file is structured as a YAML stream with two documents, each containing its own set of flags and segments.

## Code Structure
The file is organized into two YAML documents separated by `---`. Each document contains two main sections: `flags` and `segments`. The `flags` section defines feature flags with their properties, variants, and rules, while the `segments` section defines user segments with matching criteria.

## Symbols

### Document 1

#### Flags
##### flag1
###### Description
A variant flag with one variant and a rule.

###### Internal Logic
- Enabled by default
- Has one variant "variant1" with an attachment containing various data types
- Has a rule applying the variant to "segment1" with 100% rollout

##### flag2
###### Description
A boolean flag with rollout strategies.

###### Internal Logic
- Disabled by default
- Has two rollout strategies:
  1. Enabled for users in the "internal_users" segment
  2. Enabled for 50% of users

#### Segments
##### segment1
###### Description
A segment with a string comparison constraint.

###### Internal Logic
- Uses "ANY_MATCH_TYPE" for matching
- Has a constraint checking if the "fizz" property is not equal to "buzz"

### Document 2

#### Flags
##### flag3
###### Description
A simple variant flag without variants or rules.

###### Internal Logic
- Enabled by default

##### flag4
###### Description
A boolean flag with rollout strategies.

###### Internal Logic
- Disabled by default
- Has two rollout strategies:
  1. Enabled for users in the "segment2" segment
  2. Enabled for 50% of users

#### Segments
##### segment2
###### Description
A segment with a string comparison constraint.

###### Internal Logic
- Uses "ANY_MATCH_TYPE" for matching
- Has a constraint checking if the "length" property is equal to "short"

## Configuration
The file defines the following configuration options for flags:

| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| key | string | Unique identifier for the flag |
| name | string | Display name of the flag |
| type | string | Type of the flag (e.g., "VARIANT_FLAG_TYPE", "BOOLEAN_FLAG_TYPE") |
| description | string | Description of the flag's purpose |
| enabled | boolean | Whether the flag is enabled by default |
| variants | array | List of variants for variant flags |
| rules | array | Rules for applying variants to segments |
| rollouts | array | Rollout strategies for boolean flags |

For segments, the configuration options are:

| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| key | string | Unique identifier for the segment |
| name | string | Display name of the segment |
| match_type | string | Type of matching to use for the segment (e.g., "ANY_MATCH_TYPE") |
| description | string | Description of the segment's purpose |
| constraints | array | List of constraints for matching users to the segment |

This YAML configuration file provides a comprehensive setup for feature flags and user segmentation, allowing for fine-grained control over feature rollouts and targeting specific user groups.
