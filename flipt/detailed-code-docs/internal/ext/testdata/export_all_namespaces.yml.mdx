## High-level description
This YAML file defines multiple namespaces with feature flags and segments for a feature management system. It includes three namespaces (default, foo, and bar) with various flags and segments, demonstrating different flag types, rules, and segment configurations.

## Code Structure
The file is structured using YAML format with multiple documents separated by `---`. Each document represents a namespace with its associated flags and segments.

## Symbols

### Namespace
#### Description
Defines a namespace for grouping related flags and segments.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| key | string | Unique identifier for the namespace |
| name | string | Human-readable name for the namespace |
| description | string | Brief description of the namespace |

### Flags
#### Description
Defines feature flags within a namespace.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| key | string | Unique identifier for the flag |
| name | string | Human-readable name for the flag |
| type | string | Type of the flag (e.g., "VARIANT_FLAG_TYPE", "BOOLEAN_FLAG_TYPE") |
| description | string | Brief description of the flag |
| enabled | boolean | Whether the flag is enabled or not |
| variants | array | List of variants for variant flags |
| rules | array | Rules for flag evaluation |
| rollouts | array | Rollout configurations for boolean flags |

### Segments
#### Description
Defines segments for targeting specific user groups.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| key | string | Unique identifier for the segment |
| name | string | Human-readable name for the segment |
| match_type | string | Type of matching for the segment (e.g., "ANY_MATCH_TYPE") |
| description | string | Brief description of the segment |
| constraints | array | List of constraints for segment evaluation |

## Dependencies
This YAML file doesn't have direct dependencies on external libraries or modules. However, it is likely used as input data for a feature management system that can parse and interpret this configuration.

## Configuration
The file itself serves as a configuration for a feature management system. It defines three main configuration sections:

1. Namespaces
2. Flags
3. Segments

Each of these sections contains various options and settings as described in the Symbols section.

## API/Interface Reference
While this file doesn't directly expose an API, it defines a structure that could be used by a feature management system's API. The main elements that could be accessed through an API are:

| Element | Description |
|:--------|:------------|
| Namespaces | List of available namespaces |
| Flags | Feature flags within each namespace |
| Segments | User segments for targeting |

A potential API might allow operations such as:
- Retrieving flag configurations for a specific namespace
- Evaluating flag states based on user attributes and defined segments
- Managing and updating flag configurations

This YAML file serves as a comprehensive example of how feature flags, segments, and namespaces can be configured in a feature management system, showcasing various flag types, targeting rules, and segment definitions.
