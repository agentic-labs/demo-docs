## High-level description
This YAML file defines feature flags and segments for a feature flagging system. It includes two flags with different configurations and two segments with specific matching criteria.

## Symbols

### `flags`
#### Description
An array of feature flag configurations.

#### Internal Logic
Each flag is defined with properties such as key, name, description, enabled status, and either variants with rules or rollouts.

___

### `flag1`
#### Description
A feature flag with a single variant and a rule for distribution.

#### Internal Logic
- Enabled by default
- Has one variant: "variant1"
- Includes a rule that applies to "segment1" with 100% rollout for "variant1"

___

### `flag2`
#### Description
A boolean feature flag with rollout configurations.

#### Internal Logic
- Disabled by default
- Type is explicitly set to "BOOLEAN_FLAG_TYPE"
- Has two rollout configurations:
  1. Enabled for users in the "internal_users" segment
  2. Enabled for 50% of users

___

### `segments`
#### Description
An array of segment definitions used for targeting specific user groups.

#### Internal Logic
Each segment is defined with properties such as key, name, match type, description, and constraints.

___

### `segment1`
#### Description
A segment with a string comparison constraint.

#### Internal Logic
- Match type is "ANY_MATCH_TYPE"
- Has a constraint that checks if the "fizz" property is not equal to "buzz"

___

### `segment2`
#### Description
Another segment with a string comparison constraint.

#### Internal Logic
- Match type is "ANY_MATCH_TYPE"
- Has a constraint that checks if the "buzz" property is not equal to "fizz"

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| key | string | N/A | Unique identifier for flags and segments |
| name | string | N/A | Display name for flags and segments |
| description | string | N/A | Detailed description of the flag or segment |
| enabled | boolean | N/A | Indicates whether a flag is active |
| type | string | N/A | Specifies the flag type (e.g., "BOOLEAN_FLAG_TYPE") |
| match_type | string | N/A | Defines how segment constraints are evaluated (e.g., "ANY_MATCH_TYPE") |

This YAML configuration file provides a structured way to define feature flags and segments for a feature management system. It allows for fine-grained control over feature rollouts and user targeting.
