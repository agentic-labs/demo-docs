## High-level description
This JSON file contains two separate JSON objects, each representing a configuration for feature flags and segments. The file is structured as a JSON Lines format, where each line is a valid JSON object. These configurations define various feature flags with their properties, variants, rules, and associated segments.

## Symbols

### First JSON Object
#### Description
The first JSON object defines a set of feature flags and segments with detailed configurations.

#### Internal Logic
The object contains two main sections: "flags" and "segments".

1. Flags:
   - Two flags are defined: "flag1" (VARIANT_FLAG_TYPE) and "flag2" (BOOLEAN_FLAG_TYPE).
   - "flag1" includes variants, rules, and distributions.
   - "flag2" includes rollouts based on segments and thresholds.

2. Segments:
   - One segment "segment1" is defined with constraints.

### Second JSON Object
#### Description
The second JSON object defines another set of feature flags and segments, similar to the first object but with different configurations.

#### Internal Logic
This object also contains "flags" and "segments" sections:

1. Flags:
   - Two flags are defined: "flag3" (VARIANT_FLAG_TYPE) and "flag4" (BOOLEAN_FLAG_TYPE).
   - "flag3" is a simple variant flag without detailed configuration.
   - "flag4" includes rollouts based on segments and thresholds.

2. Segments:
   - One segment "segment2" is defined with constraints.

## Dependencies
This file doesn't directly depend on any external libraries or modules. However, it's likely used as test data for a system that processes feature flags and segments, possibly related to A/B testing or feature management.

## Configuration
The file itself serves as a configuration for feature flags and segments. Here's a breakdown of the main configuration options:

| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| flags | array | List of feature flag configurations |
| segments | array | List of segment configurations |

For flags:
| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| key | string | Unique identifier for the flag |
| name | string | Display name of the flag |
| type | string | Type of the flag (e.g., VARIANT_FLAG_TYPE, BOOLEAN_FLAG_TYPE) |
| description | string | Description of the flag's purpose |
| enabled | boolean | Whether the flag is currently enabled |
| variants | array | List of variants for VARIANT_FLAG_TYPE |
| rules | array | Rules for flag distribution |
| rollouts | array | Rollout configurations for BOOLEAN_FLAG_TYPE |

For segments:
| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| key | string | Unique identifier for the segment |
| name | string | Display name of the segment |
| match_type | string | Type of matching for the segment (e.g., ANY_MATCH_TYPE) |
| description | string | Description of the segment's purpose |
| constraints | array | List of constraints for the segment |

## API/Interface Reference
While this file doesn't define an API directly, it represents a data structure that could be used in an API for feature flag management. The structure suggests the following potential endpoints:

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:------------|
| /flags | GET | Retrieve all feature flags |
| /flags/{key} | GET | Retrieve a specific feature flag by key |
| /segments | GET | Retrieve all segments |
| /segments/{key} | GET | Retrieve a specific segment by key |

Note: This is a JSON file, likely used as test data, so it doesn't implement an actual API. The suggested endpoints are based on the structure of the data and common practices in feature flag management systems.
