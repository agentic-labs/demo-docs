## High-level description
This YAML file defines a configuration for feature flags and user segments in a feature management system. It includes definitions for a namespace, multiple flags with their variants and rules, and user segments with constraints.

## Code Structure
The YAML structure is organized into three main sections: namespace, flags, and segments. These sections define the configuration for a feature management system, with flags referencing segments in their rules.

## Symbols

### version
#### Description
Specifies the version of the configuration format.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| version | string | The version number of the configuration format |

### namespace
#### Description
Defines the default namespace for the configuration.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| key | string | The unique identifier for the namespace |
| name | string | The display name for the namespace |
| description | string | A brief description of the namespace |

### flags
#### Description
An array of feature flag definitions.

#### Inputs
Each flag in the array has the following structure:

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| key | string | The unique identifier for the flag |
| name | string | The display name for the flag |
| type | string | The type of the flag (e.g., "VARIANT_FLAG_TYPE", "BOOLEAN_FLAG_TYPE") |
| description | string | A brief description of the flag |
| enabled | boolean | Whether the flag is enabled or not |
| variants | array | (Optional) An array of variant definitions for the flag |
| rules | array | (Optional) An array of rules for flag distribution |
| rollouts | array | (Optional) An array of rollout configurations for the flag |
| metadata | object | Additional metadata for the flag |

### segments
#### Description
An array of user segment definitions.

#### Inputs
Each segment in the array has the following structure:

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| key | string | The unique identifier for the segment |
| name | string | The display name for the segment |
| match_type | string | The type of matching to use for the segment (e.g., "ANY_MATCH_TYPE") |
| description | string | A brief description of the segment |
| constraints | array | (Optional) An array of constraints for the segment |

## Dependencies
This YAML file doesn't have any external dependencies. It's a self-contained configuration file.

## Configuration
The entire file serves as a configuration for a feature management system. Key configuration elements include:

1. Namespace definition
2. Feature flag definitions with variants, rules, and rollouts
3. User segment definitions with constraints

## Error Handling
This YAML file doesn't include explicit error handling. Error handling would typically be implemented by the system that reads and processes this configuration.

## API/Interface Reference
While this is not an API definition, it does define the structure for configuring a feature management system. The main elements of this interface are:

1. Namespace configuration
2. Flag definitions
3. Segment definitions

These elements would be used by a feature management system to control feature rollouts and targeting.
