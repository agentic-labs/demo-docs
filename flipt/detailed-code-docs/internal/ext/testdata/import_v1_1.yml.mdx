## High-level description
This YAML file defines a configuration for feature flags and segments in version 1.1 of an import format. It specifies two flags with different types and configurations, along with a segment definition used for targeting specific users or groups.

## Symbols

### Flags
#### Description
The `flags` section defines an array of feature flags, each with its own configuration.

#### Internal Logic
Each flag contains:
- Basic information (key, name, type, description, enabled status)
- Variants (for VARIANT_FLAG_TYPE)
- Rules (for targeting and distribution)
- Rollouts (for BOOLEAN_FLAG_TYPE)

### Flag 1: "flag1"
#### Description
A variant-type flag named "flag1" with one variant and one rule.

#### Internal Logic
- Type: VARIANT_FLAG_TYPE
- Enabled: true
- Contains one variant "variant1" with a complex attachment
- Has one rule targeting "segment1" with 100% rollout for "variant1"

### Flag 2: "flag2"
#### Description
A boolean-type flag named "flag2" with two rollout configurations.

#### Internal Logic
- Type: BOOLEAN_FLAG_TYPE
- Enabled: false
- Has two rollout configurations:
  1. Enabled for internal users (using a segment)
  2. Enabled for 50% of users (using a threshold)

### Segments
#### Description
The `segments` section defines an array of segments used for targeting specific users or groups.

#### Internal Logic
Contains one segment "segment1" with:
- Match type: ANY_MATCH_TYPE
- One constraint of type STRING_COMPARISON_TYPE

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| version | string | Specifies the version of the import format (1.1) |
| flags | array | List of feature flag configurations |
| segments | array | List of segment definitions for targeting |

## Dependencies
This YAML file doesn't explicitly reference any external libraries or modules. It appears to be a configuration file that would be consumed by a feature flag management system.

Note: This file is likely used as test data (as indicated by its location in a "testdata" directory) for importing feature flag configurations in a specific format.
