## High-level description
This YAML file defines a configuration for feature flags and segments within a single namespace called "foo". It includes two flags with different types and configurations, as well as a segment definition with constraints.

## Symbols

### Namespace
#### Description
The namespace is defined as "foo", which serves as a container for the flags and segments defined in this configuration.

### Flags
#### Description
Two flags are defined in this configuration: "flag1" and "flag2". Each flag has its own set of properties and configurations.

#### Internal Logic
1. "flag1" is a variant flag with one variant and associated rules.
2. "flag2" is a boolean flag with rollout configurations.

### flag1
#### Description
A variant flag named "flag1" with a single variant and associated rules.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| key | string | Unique identifier for the flag |
| name | string | Display name for the flag |
| type | string | Type of the flag (VARIANT_FLAG_TYPE) |
| description | string | Description of the flag |
| enabled | boolean | Whether the flag is enabled |
| variants | array | List of variants for the flag |
| rules | array | List of rules for flag distribution |

#### Internal Logic
1. Defines a single variant "variant1" with an attachment containing various data types.
2. Specifies a rule that applies the variant to a segment with 100% rollout.

### flag2
#### Description
A boolean flag named "flag2" with rollout configurations.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| key | string | Unique identifier for the flag |
| name | string | Display name for the flag |
| type | string | Type of the flag (BOOLEAN_FLAG_TYPE) |
| description | string | Description of the flag |
| enabled | boolean | Whether the flag is enabled |
| rollouts | array | List of rollout configurations |

#### Internal Logic
1. Defines two rollout configurations:
   a. Enables the flag for internal users based on a segment.
   b. Enables the flag for 50% of users based on a threshold.

### Segments
#### Description
Defines a segment named "segment1" with specific matching criteria.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| key | string | Unique identifier for the segment |
| name | string | Display name for the segment |
| match_type | string | Type of matching for the segment (ANY_MATCH_TYPE) |
| description | string | Description of the segment |
| constraints | array | List of constraints for the segment |

#### Internal Logic
Defines a single constraint of type STRING_COMPARISON_TYPE that checks if the "fizz" property is not equal to "buzz".

## Dependencies
This YAML file doesn't have any external dependencies. It's a self-contained configuration file.

## Configuration
The entire file serves as a configuration for feature flags and segments. The main configuration options are:

| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| namespace | string | The namespace for the flags and segments |
| flags | array | List of feature flags |
| segments | array | List of segments |

Each flag and segment has its own set of configuration options as detailed in their respective sections.

## Notes
1. This file appears to be a test data file, as indicated by its location in the "testdata" directory.
2. The file demonstrates various types of feature flags (variant and boolean) and their associated configurations.
3. It showcases different data types that can be used in flag attachments and segment constraints.
4. The configuration allows for complex rollout strategies, including segment-based and percentage-based rollouts.
