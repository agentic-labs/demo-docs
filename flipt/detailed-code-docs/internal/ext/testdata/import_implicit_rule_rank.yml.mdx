## High-level description
This YAML file defines feature flags and segments for a feature flagging system. It includes two flags with different types and configurations, as well as a segment definition with constraints.

## Symbols

### `flags`
#### Description
An array of feature flag definitions.

#### Internal Logic
Each flag contains properties such as key, name, type, description, enabled status, and additional configuration depending on the flag type.

___

### `flag1`
#### Description
A variant-type feature flag with a single variant and a rule for segment-based distribution.

#### Internal Logic
- Defines a variant named "variant1" with an attachment containing various data types.
- Includes a rule for "segment1" with 100% rollout for the defined variant.

___

### `flag2`
#### Description
A boolean-type feature flag with rollout configurations based on segments and thresholds.

#### Internal Logic
- Defines two rollout configurations:
  1. Enabled for users in the "internal_users" segment.
  2. Enabled for 50% of users based on a threshold.

___

### `segments`
#### Description
An array of segment definitions used for targeting specific user groups.

#### Internal Logic
Defines a single segment "segment1" with a constraint based on string comparison.

___

### `segment1`
#### Description
A segment definition with a string comparison constraint.

#### Internal Logic
- Uses "ANY_MATCH_TYPE" for matching.
- Defines a constraint that checks if the "fizz" property is not equal to "buzz".

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| flags | array | N/A | List of feature flag configurations |
| segments | array | N/A | List of segment definitions for targeting |

Note: This YAML file serves as a configuration for a feature flagging system, defining the structure and properties of flags and segments. It does not contain executable code but rather data that would be used by a feature flag management system to control feature availability and targeting.
