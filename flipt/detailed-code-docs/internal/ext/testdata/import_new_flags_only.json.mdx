## High-level description
This JSON file defines a configuration for feature flags and user segments. It contains two feature flags with different structures and two user segments with specific constraints. This configuration is likely used in a feature flagging system to control the rollout of features to different user groups.

## Symbols

### flags
#### Description
An array of feature flag configurations. Each flag has a unique key, name, description, and enabled status. The flags can have variants and rules or rollouts depending on their type.

#### Internal Logic
The file defines two different types of flags:
1. A flag with variants and rules (flag1)
2. A boolean flag with rollouts (flag2)

### segments
#### Description
An array of user segment definitions. Each segment has a key, name, match type, description, and constraints that define the criteria for users to be included in the segment.

## Dependencies
This JSON file doesn't have any direct code dependencies, but it's likely used by a feature flagging system that interprets this configuration.

### Configuration

| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| flags | array | Array of feature flag configurations |
| segments | array | Array of user segment definitions |
