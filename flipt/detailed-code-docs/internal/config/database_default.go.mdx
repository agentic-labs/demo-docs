title: "database_default.go"

## High-level description
This code defines a default database root directory function for non-Linux operating systems. It's part of the `config` package and provides a platform-specific implementation for determining the default database root location.

## Symbols

### `defaultDatabaseRoot`
#### Description
The `defaultDatabaseRoot` function returns the default root directory for the database on non-Linux systems. It simply calls and returns the result of the `Dir()` function.

#### Inputs
This function takes no inputs.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| string | string | The default database root directory path |
| error | error | Any error encountered while determining the directory |

#### Internal Logic
The function internally calls `Dir()` and returns its result. The implementation of `Dir()` is not provided in this file, but it's likely defined elsewhere in the `config` package.

## Build Tags
The file uses build tags to ensure this implementation is only used for non-Linux operating systems:

1. `//go:build !linux`: This is the new-style build constraint syntax.
2. `// +build !linux`: This is the old-style build constraint syntax, included for compatibility with older Go versions.

These tags ensure that this file is only compiled and used when building for operating systems other than Linux.

## Dependencies
The code depends on the `Dir()` function, which is likely defined in another file within the `config` package.

## Notes
1. This implementation is specifically for non-Linux systems. There's likely a separate implementation for Linux systems in another file.
2. The function's simplicity suggests that the `Dir()` function is responsible for the actual logic of determining the appropriate directory across different non-Linux platforms.
3. Error handling is delegated to the `Dir()` function, as any error it returns is directly passed through `defaultDatabaseRoot`.
