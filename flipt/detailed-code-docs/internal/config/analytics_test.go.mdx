### TestAnalyticsClickhouseConfiguration
#### Description
This function is a unit test that verifies the behavior of the AnalyticsConfig and ClickhouseConfig structures, particularly focusing on the Clickhouse storage configuration and options generation.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| t | *testing.T | The testing object provided by Go's testing framework |

#### Internal Logic
1. Arrange:
   - Creates an AnalyticsConfig instance with Clickhouse storage enabled and a valid URL.
2. Act and Assert (Valid Configuration):
   - Checks if the configuration is enabled.
   - Generates Clickhouse options from the configuration.
   - Verifies the generated options match the expected values.
3. Act and Assert (Invalid Configuration):
   - Modifies the Clickhouse URL to an invalid value.
   - Attempts to generate options again and expects an error.

The test expects:
1. The configuration to be enabled.
2. No error when generating options from a valid URL.
3. Correct address and database in the generated options.
4. An error when generating options from an invalid URL.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|

- AnalyticsConfig
- AnalyticsStorageConfig
- ClickhouseConfig
