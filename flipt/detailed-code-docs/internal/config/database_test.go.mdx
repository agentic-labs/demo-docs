## High-level description
This code is a unit test for the `defaultDatabaseRoot` function in the `config` package. It verifies that the function returns the correct default database root path on non-Linux systems.

## Symbols

### TestDefaultDatabaseRoot
#### Description
This function is a unit test that checks the behavior of the `defaultDatabaseRoot` function. It ensures that the function returns the expected default database root path.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| t | *testing.T | The testing object provided by Go's testing framework |

#### Internal Logic
1. Call `defaultDatabaseRoot()` to get the root path and any error.
2. Assert that no error occurred using `require.NoError`.
3. Get the user's config directory using `os.UserConfigDir()`.
4. Assert that no error occurred when getting the config directory.
5. Compare the returned root path with the expected path (config directory + "flipt") using `assert.Equal`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| os | To get the user's config directory |
| path/filepath | To join path components |
| testing | Go's testing framework |
| github.com/stretchr/testify/assert | For test assertions |
| github.com/stretchr/testify/require | For test requirements |

## Build Tags
This test file includes build tags:
```go
//go:build !linux
// +build !linux
```
These tags indicate that this test should be run on all platforms except Linux. This suggests that there might be a different implementation or test for Linux systems.

## Notes
1. The test is checking the behavior of `defaultDatabaseRoot()`, which is not shown in the provided code. It's likely defined in another file within the same package.
2. The expected default database root is a subdirectory named "flipt" within the user's config directory.
3. This test ensures that the default database root is correctly set for non-Linux systems, implying that Linux might have a different default location.
