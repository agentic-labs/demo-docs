title: "invalid_clickhouse_configuration_empty_url.yml"
---

## High-level description
This YAML configuration file is part of the testdata for the analytics module. It represents an invalid configuration for ClickHouse storage, where the URL is missing despite the storage being enabled.

## Symbols

### `analytics`
#### Description
The top-level key in the YAML file that contains configuration settings for the analytics module.

### `analytics.storage`
#### Description
A nested key under `analytics` that specifies storage-related configurations for the analytics module.

### `analytics.storage.clickhouse`
#### Description
A nested key under `storage` that contains configuration settings specific to ClickHouse storage.

#### Internal Logic
This configuration is intentionally invalid as it only specifies that ClickHouse is enabled but does not provide the required URL for connection.

### `analytics.storage.clickhouse.enabled`
#### Description
A boolean flag indicating whether ClickHouse storage is enabled for the analytics module.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| enabled | boolean | Indicates if ClickHouse storage is enabled |

## Error Handling
This configuration file is intentionally invalid and is likely used in test scenarios to verify that the application correctly handles missing required configuration parameters (in this case, the missing ClickHouse URL).

## TODOs
The configuration is incomplete and invalid by design. In a real-world scenario, it would need to include the ClickHouse URL and possibly other required parameters for a valid ClickHouse configuration.
