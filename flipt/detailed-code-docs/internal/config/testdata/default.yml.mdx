## High-level description
This YAML file represents a default configuration for a system, likely named Flipt. It contains various configuration options for logging, user interface, CORS, caching, server settings, and database connection. All options are commented out, suggesting these are default or example settings that can be uncommented and modified as needed.

## Configuration
The file defines several configuration options, all of which are currently commented out. Here's a breakdown of the available settings:

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| log.level | string | INFO | Sets the general logging level |
| log.grpc_level | string | ERROR | Sets the logging level for gRPC |
| ui.enabled | boolean | true | Enables or disables the user interface |
| cors.enabled | boolean | false | Enables or disables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing |
| cors.allowed_origins | string | "*" | Specifies allowed origins for CORS |
| cache.enabled | boolean | false | Enables or disables caching |
| cache.backend | string | memory | Specifies the caching backend to use |
| cache.ttl | duration | 60s | Sets the Time To Live for cached items |
| cache.memory.eviction_interval | duration | 5m | Sets the interval for evicting expired items from memory cache |
| server.protocol | string | http | Specifies the server protocol |
| server.host | string | 0.0.0.0 | Sets the server host |
| server.https_port | integer | 443 | Sets the HTTPS port |
| server.http_port | integer | 8080 | Sets the HTTP port |
| server.grpc_port | integer | 9000 | Sets the gRPC port |
| db.url | string | file:/var/opt/flipt/flipt.db | Specifies the database connection URL |

## Notes
1. All configuration options are commented out, indicating that these are default or example values.
2. The configuration covers various aspects of the system, including logging, UI, CORS, caching, server settings, and database connection.
3. The presence of both HTTP and gRPC ports suggests that the system supports both REST and gRPC APIs.
4. The default database appears to be a file-based SQLite database located at `/var/opt/flipt/flipt.db`.
5. The caching configuration includes options for in-memory caching with customizable TTL and eviction intervals.
6. CORS is disabled by default but can be enabled with all origins allowed ("*").
7. The server is configured to listen on all interfaces (0.0.0.0) by default.

This configuration file provides a template for users to customize the behavior of the Flipt system according to their needs by uncommenting and modifying the relevant options.
