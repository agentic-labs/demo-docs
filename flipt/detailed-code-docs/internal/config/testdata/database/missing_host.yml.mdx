title: "missing_host.yml"
---

## High-level description
This YAML file represents a configuration for a database connection in a test environment. It specifically demonstrates a scenario where the database host is missing from the configuration, which is likely used to test error handling or default behavior in the application.

## Code Structure
This file contains a single YAML document with commented-out sections for various application components and an active `db` section with database connection details.

## Symbols

### `db`
#### Description
The `db` section defines the database connection parameters for the application.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| protocol | string | The database protocol (mysql in this case) |
| port | integer | The port number for the database connection |
| name | string | The name of the database |
| user | string | The username for database authentication |
| password | string | The password for database authentication |

#### Internal Logic
The configuration deliberately omits the `host` parameter, which is typically required for a database connection. This omission is likely intentional for testing purposes, to verify how the application handles missing critical configuration elements.

## Configuration
The file defines configuration options for the database connection. Here's a table of the active options:

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| db.protocol | string | mysql | The database protocol to use |
| db.port | integer | 3306 | The port number for the database connection |
| db.name | string | flipt | The name of the database to connect to |
| db.user | string | flipt | The username for database authentication |
| db.password | string | s3cr3t! | The password for database authentication |

Note: The `host` option is intentionally commented out, which is the key aspect of this test configuration file.

## TODOs
The file contains several commented-out sections that might be used in other test scenarios or in the actual application configuration. These sections include:

1. Log configuration
2. UI settings
3. CORS settings
4. Cache configuration
5. Server configuration

These commented sections provide insight into other possible configuration options for the application, which might be relevant in different test cases or in the production environment.
