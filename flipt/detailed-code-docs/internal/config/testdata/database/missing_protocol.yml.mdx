title: "missing_protocol.yml"
---

## High-level description
This YAML file contains configuration settings for a database connection. It appears to be a test data file specifically designed to demonstrate a scenario where the database protocol is missing from the configuration.

## Code Structure
This file consists of a single YAML document with commented-out sections for various application components and an active `db` section with database connection details.

## Symbols

### `db`
#### Description
The `db` section defines the configuration for a database connection. It includes various parameters necessary for establishing a connection to a database server, but notably lacks the `protocol` field.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| host | string | The hostname or IP address of the database server |
| port | integer | The port number on which the database server is listening |
| name | string | The name of the database to connect to |
| user | string | The username for authenticating with the database |
| password | string | The password for authenticating with the database |

#### Internal Logic
The file intentionally omits the `protocol` field under the `db` section, which would typically specify the type of database being used (e.g., mysql, postgresql). This omission is likely intentional to test how the application handles missing critical configuration information.

## Configuration
The active configuration options in this file are:
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| db.host | string | "localhost" | The hostname of the database server |
| db.port | integer | 3306 | The port number for the database connection |
| db.name | string | "flipt" | The name of the database to connect to |
| db.user | string | "flipt" | The username for database authentication |
| db.password | string | "s3cr3t!" | The password for database authentication |

Note: The `protocol` field is intentionally commented out to create a "missing protocol" scenario.

## TODOs
The file contains several commented-out sections that might be used in other test scenarios or could be uncommented for different configuration tests:
- `log`: Logging configuration
- `ui`: User interface settings
- `cors`: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing settings
- `cache`: Caching configuration
- `server`: Server protocol and port settings

These sections are likely used in other test files or scenarios and are kept here for reference or future use.
