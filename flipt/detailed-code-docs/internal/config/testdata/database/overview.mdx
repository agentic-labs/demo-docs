## High-level description
This directory contains YAML configuration files used for testing database connection scenarios in the application. The files are specifically designed to simulate various error conditions or edge cases in database configuration, such as missing critical parameters.

## What does it do?
The files in this directory serve as test data for the application's configuration parsing and validation processes. They simulate different scenarios where essential database connection parameters are missing, allowing developers to test how the application handles incomplete or incorrect configurations. This helps ensure that the application can gracefully handle and report configuration errors, improving its robustness and user-friendliness.

## Key Files

1. `missing_host.yml`: This file simulates a scenario where the database host is not specified in the configuration.

2. `missing_name.yml`: This file represents a case where the database name is omitted from the configuration.

3. `missing_protocol.yml`: This file demonstrates a situation where the database protocol is not provided in the configuration.

Each of these files contains a partial database configuration with one critical element intentionally omitted. The files share a common structure, with the `db` section being the primary focus and other application components (like logging, UI, CORS, cache, and server settings) commented out.

## Configuration
The configuration files in this directory follow a consistent structure, focusing on the `db` section. Here's a comprehensive view of the configurable fields across all files:

| Field | Type | Description | Present in |
|:------|:-----|:------------|:-----------|
| db.protocol | string | The database protocol (e.g., mysql) | missing_host.yml, missing_name.yml |
| db.host | string | The database server hostname | missing_name.yml, missing_protocol.yml |
| db.port | integer | The database server port | All files |
| db.name | string | The name of the database | missing_host.yml, missing_protocol.yml |
| db.user | string | The database user | All files |
| db.password | string | The database password | All files |

Each file intentionally omits one of these fields to create specific test scenarios:

1. `missing_host.yml`: The `db.host` field is commented out.
2. `missing_name.yml`: The `db.name` field is commented out.
3. `missing_protocol.yml`: The `db.protocol` field is commented out.

These configurations are designed to test how the application handles missing critical information in database connections. They allow developers to verify that the application correctly identifies and reports configuration errors, ensuring robust error handling and user feedback.

It's worth noting that these files also include commented-out sections for other application components such as logging, UI settings, CORS, caching, and server configuration. While not active in these test scenarios, these sections provide insight into the broader configuration structure of the application and may be used in other test cases or in the production environment.

The consistent use of certain values across the files (e.g., port 3306, user "flipt", password "s3cr3t!") suggests these are standard test values used throughout the application's test suite.

Developers using these configuration files should be aware of their purpose in testing and avoid using them in production environments. The intentional omissions are designed to trigger error handling and validation processes in the application's configuration parsing logic.
