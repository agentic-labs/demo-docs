## High-level description
This directory contains YAML configuration files used for testing version-related functionality in the internal configuration system. It includes two files: an invalid version specification and a valid version 1.0 specification. These files are likely used to test the system's ability to handle different version configurations, including error cases.

## What does it do?
The files in this directory serve as test data for the configuration parsing and version checking mechanisms of the internal configuration system. They provide examples of both valid and invalid version specifications, allowing developers to test how the system responds to different scenarios. This helps ensure that the configuration system can correctly identify and process version information, as well as handle errors when invalid versions are encountered.

## Key Files

1. `invalid.yml`:
   This file contains an invalid version specification ("2.0"). It is used to test the system's error handling and validation capabilities when encountering incorrect version formats or unsupported versions.

   ```yaml
   version: "2.0"
   ```

2. `v1.yml`:
   This file contains a valid version 1.0 specification. It serves as a reference for the correct format of version information and is likely used in positive test cases.

   ```yaml
   version: "1.0"
   ```

## Configuration
Both files use a simple key-value pair structure to specify the version:

| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| version | string | Specifies the version of the configuration or system |

In `invalid.yml`, the version is set to "2.0", which is presumably not a supported version or is in an incorrect format. This is intentional to test error handling.

In `v1.yml`, the version is set to "1.0", representing a valid version specification.

These files are designed to be used in conjunction with the configuration parsing and validation logic elsewhere in the codebase. Developers can use these files to:

1. Test that the system correctly identifies and processes valid version information.
2. Verify that appropriate error handling mechanisms are in place for invalid version specifications.
3. Ensure that the configuration system can differentiate between supported and unsupported versions.

By including both valid and invalid cases, the test data covers different scenarios that the configuration system might encounter in real-world usage, helping to ensure robustness and reliability in version handling.
