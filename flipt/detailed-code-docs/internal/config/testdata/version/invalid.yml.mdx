## High-level description
This file, named "invalid.yml", is a YAML configuration file located in the testdata directory for version testing. It contains an invalid version specification, likely used for testing how the system handles incorrect version configurations.

## Symbols

### version
#### Description
The `version` key in this YAML file is set to the string value "2.0". This appears to be an invalid version specification, as it's likely that the expected version format is different or that "2.0" is not a supported version.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| version | string | The version identifier |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| version | string | "2.0" | Specifies the version of the configuration, likely invalid for testing purposes |

## Error Handling
This file is intentionally set up with an invalid version, presumably to test how the system handles incorrect version specifications. The error handling for this case would likely be implemented in the code that processes this configuration file, not in the file itself.

## TODOs
While there are no explicit TODOs in this file, its purpose as an invalid configuration suggests that it's intended to be used in tests to ensure proper error handling and validation of version specifications in the larger system.
