title: "envsubst.yml"
---

## High-level description
This YAML file serves as a configuration template for a server application. It uses environment variable substitution to allow dynamic configuration of the server's HTTP port and log encoding format.

## Symbols

### `server`
#### Description
This section defines server-related configuration settings.

#### Internal Logic
The `http_port` value is set to be substituted with the value of the `HTTP_PORT` environment variable at runtime.

### `log`
#### Description
This section defines logging-related configuration settings.

#### Internal Logic
The `encoding` value is set to be substituted with the value of the `LOG_FORMAT` environment variable at runtime.

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| server.http_port | string | ${HTTP_PORT} | The HTTP port on which the server will listen. This value will be replaced by the `HTTP_PORT` environment variable. |
| log.encoding | string | ${LOG_FORMAT} | The encoding format for logs. This value will be replaced by the `LOG_FORMAT` environment variable. |

## Dependencies
This configuration file relies on environment variable substitution, which is typically handled by a YAML parsing library or a custom configuration loader that supports environment variable interpolation.

## Notes
1. This file is located in the `testdata` directory, suggesting it's used for testing purposes, possibly to verify the correct handling of environment variable substitution in the configuration loading process.
2. The use of environment variables allows for flexible configuration across different environments (e.g., development, staging, production) without modifying the configuration file itself.
3. The actual values for `HTTP_PORT` and `LOG_FORMAT` should be set in the environment where the application is running, or provided through a .env file or similar mechanism.
