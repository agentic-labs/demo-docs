## Notes
1. The filename `trim_trailing_slash.yml` suggests that this configuration file might be used in a test scenario where the trailing slash in the `cloud.host` value is expected to be trimmed.
2. The `experimental.cloud.enabled` flag set to `true` indicates that this configuration is enabling some experimental cloud features, which may not be stable or fully tested.
3. This file is located in a `testdata` directory, further confirming its use in testing scenarios rather than production configurations.
