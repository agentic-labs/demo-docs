## High-level description
This directory contains YAML configuration files for authentication and authorization settings in a system, likely for a service called Flipt. The files define various authentication methods and authorization configurations, including both standard and experimental features.

## What does it do?
These configuration files set up the rules for how users can prove their identity (authentication) and what they're allowed to do in the system (authorization). They offer flexibility in how the system can be set up:

1. One file shows a comprehensive setup with multiple ways for users to log in, including using sessions, tokens, OpenID Connect (like logging in with Google), Kubernetes, and GitHub. It also sets up strict rules about who can do what in the system.

2. Another file shows a more relaxed setup where users don't necessarily need to prove who they are to use the system, but there are still rules about what actions are allowed.

These configurations allow system administrators to fine-tune security and access control based on their specific needs, from highly secure environments to more open systems.

## Key Files

1. `all_authentication_methods_enabled.yml`:
   This file showcases a comprehensive authentication and authorization setup. It enables multiple authentication methods and sets up strict authorization rules.

   Key features:
   - Authentication is required
   - Enables session-based, token-based, OIDC, Kubernetes, and GitHub authentication methods
   - Sets up authorization with a local backend
   - Enables an experimental authorization feature

2. `authentication_not_required.yml`:
   This file demonstrates a configuration where authentication is optional but authorization is still enforced.

   Key features:
   - Authentication is not required
   - Token-based authentication is enabled with a bootstrap token
   - Authorization is required
   - Enables an experimental authorization feature

## Configuration
Both files use YAML format for configuration. Here's a combined overview of the configurable options:

| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| authentication.required | boolean | Determines if authentication is mandatory |
| authentication.session.domain | string | Domain for authentication sessions |
| authentication.session.secure | boolean | Enables secure sessions |
| authentication.session.csrf.key | string | CSRF protection key |
| authentication.methods.*.enabled | boolean | Enables specific authentication method |
| authentication.methods.*.cleanup.interval | duration | Cleanup interval for authentication method |
| authentication.methods.*.cleanup.grace_period | duration | Grace period for authentication method cleanup |
| authentication.methods.token.bootstrap.token | string | Specifies the bootstrap token value |
| authentication.methods.token.bootstrap.expiration | duration | Sets the expiration time for the bootstrap token |
| authorization.required | boolean | Determines if authorization is mandatory |
| authorization.backend | string | Specifies the authorization backend |
| authorization.local.policy.path | string | Path to the local authorization policy file |
| experimental.authorization.enabled | boolean | Enables experimental authorization feature |

Note: The actual values for these options vary between the two configuration files, allowing for different security setups.

It's important to note that these files contain sensitive information such as tokens and CSRF keys. In a production environment, these should be securely managed and not stored in plain text.

The presence of an `experimental.authorization` section in both files suggests that new authorization features are being tested, which could provide additional functionality or improved security in future versions of the system.
