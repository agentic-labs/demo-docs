title: "authentication_not_required.yml"
---

## High-level description
This YAML configuration file defines authentication and authorization settings for a system. It specifically sets up a scenario where authentication is not required, but authorization is enabled and required.

## Symbols

### `authentication`
#### Description
Configures the authentication settings for the system.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets `required` to `false`, indicating that authentication is not mandatory.
- Defines a `methods` section with a `token` subsection, enabling token-based authentication despite it not being required.
- Specifies a bootstrap token with a value of "s3cr3t!" and an expiration time of 24 hours.

### `authorization`
#### Description
Configures the authorization settings for the system.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets `required` to `true`, indicating that authorization is mandatory.

### `experimental`
#### Description
Defines experimental features or configurations.

#### Internal Logic
- Contains an `authorization` subsection with `enabled` set to `true`, suggesting that an experimental authorization feature is activated.

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| authentication.required | boolean | false | Determines if authentication is mandatory |
| authentication.methods.token.enabled | boolean | true | Enables token-based authentication |
| authentication.methods.token.bootstrap.token | string | "s3cr3t!" | Specifies the bootstrap token value |
| authentication.methods.token.bootstrap.expiration | duration | 24h | Sets the expiration time for the bootstrap token |
| authorization.required | boolean | true | Determines if authorization is mandatory |
| experimental.authorization.enabled | boolean | true | Enables experimental authorization features |

## Notes
This configuration presents an interesting scenario where authentication is not required (`authentication.required: false`), but authorization is required (`authorization.required: true`). This setup might be used in situations where:

1. The system is in a trusted environment where authentication is handled externally or not needed.
2. Authorization is still necessary to control access to different resources or functionalities within the system.
3. Token-based authentication is configured and enabled, possibly for optional use or for specific parts of the system.

The presence of the `experimental.authorization.enabled` flag suggests that there might be new or advanced authorization features being tested in this configuration.
