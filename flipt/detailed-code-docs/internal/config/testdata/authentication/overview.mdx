## High-level description
This directory contains YAML configuration files for testing various authentication scenarios in a software system. The files cover different authentication methods including GitHub OAuth, JWT (JSON Web Token), OpenID Connect (OIDC), Kubernetes, and token-based authentication. These test configurations are designed to validate the system's behavior under various authentication settings, including both valid and invalid configurations.

## What does it do?
The configuration files in this directory serve as test data for the authentication system. They define different authentication scenarios, including:

1. GitHub OAuth authentication with various edge cases (missing client ID, missing client secret, etc.)
2. JWT authentication with different configurations (missing key file, invalid JWKS URL, etc.)
3. OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication with various provider settings
4. Kubernetes authentication
5. Token-based authentication with different cleanup and bootstrap settings

These files allow developers to test how the authentication system handles different configurations, including error cases and edge scenarios. By using these test configurations, developers can ensure that the authentication system behaves correctly under various circumstances, handles errors gracefully, and properly implements security measures.

## Key Files

1. GitHub Authentication Files:
   - `github_missing_client_id.yml`: Tests handling of missing GitHub OAuth client ID
   - `github_missing_client_secret.yml`: Tests handling of missing GitHub OAuth client secret
   - `github_missing_org_scope.yml`: Tests GitHub authentication without organization scope
   - `github_missing_org_when_declaring_allowed_teams.yml`: Tests GitHub team restrictions without proper organization configuration
   - `github_missing_redirect_address.yml`: Tests handling of missing redirect address in GitHub OAuth

2. JWT Authentication Files:
   - `jwt_invalid_jwks_url.yml`: Tests JWT authentication with an invalid JWKS URL
   - `jwt_key_file_and_jwks_url.yml`: Tests JWT configuration with both key file and JWKS URL specified
   - `jwt_key_file_not_found.yml`: Tests handling of missing JWT key file
   - `jwt_missing_key_file_and_jwks_url.yml`: Tests JWT configuration without key file or JWKS URL

3. OIDC Authentication Files:
   - `oidc_missing_client_id.yml`: Tests OIDC configuration with missing client ID
   - `oidc_missing_client_secret.yml`: Tests OIDC configuration with missing client secret
   - `oidc_missing_redirect_address.yml`: Tests OIDC configuration with missing redirect address

4. Other Authentication Files:
   - `kubernetes.yml`: Tests Kubernetes authentication configuration
   - `session_domain_scheme_port.yml`: Tests session configuration with specific domain, scheme, and port
   - `token_bootstrap_token.yml`: Tests token-based authentication with bootstrap token
   - `token_negative_interval.yml`: Tests token cleanup with an invalid negative interval
   - `token_zero_grace_period.yml`: Tests token cleanup with zero grace period

These files cover a wide range of authentication scenarios and edge cases, allowing thorough testing of the authentication system's robustness and error handling capabilities.

## Dependencies
The configuration files in this directory do not directly specify any external dependencies. However, they imply the use of various authentication protocols and services:

1. GitHub OAuth API
2. JSON Web Token (JWT) libraries
3. OpenID Connect (OIDC) protocol
4. Kubernetes authentication mechanisms
5. Custom token-based authentication system

The exact versions of these dependencies would be specified in the main application code rather than in these test configuration files.

## Configuration
The configuration files in this directory use YAML format and typically include the following main sections:

1. `authentication`: The root configuration object
   - `required`: Boolean flag indicating if authentication is mandatory
   - `session`: Session-related settings (domain, secure flag)
   - `methods`: Defines available authentication methods

2. Method-specific configurations:
   - `github`: Settings for GitHub OAuth
   - `jwt`: Settings for JWT authentication
   - `oidc`: Settings for OpenID Connect
   - `kubernetes`: Settings for Kubernetes authentication
   - `token`: Settings for token-based authentication

Each file focuses on specific aspects of authentication configuration, often intentionally omitting or misconfiguring certain parameters to test system behavior in edge cases.

These test configurations are crucial for ensuring the reliability and security of the authentication system across various scenarios and potential misconfigurations.
