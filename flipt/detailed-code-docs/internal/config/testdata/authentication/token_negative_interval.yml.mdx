title: "token_negative_interval.yml"
---

## High-level description
This YAML configuration file defines authentication settings for a system, specifically focusing on token-based authentication. It sets up token authentication with a negative cleanup interval, which is likely an invalid or test configuration.

## Symbols

### `authentication`
#### Description
The root configuration block for authentication settings.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets `required` to `true`, indicating that authentication is mandatory for the system.
- Defines `methods` for authentication, specifically the `token` method.

### `authentication.methods.token`
#### Description
Configures the token-based authentication method.

#### Internal Logic
- Enables token authentication by setting `enabled` to `true`.
- Defines a `cleanup` configuration with an invalid negative interval.

### `authentication.methods.token.cleanup.interval`
#### Description
Specifies the interval for token cleanup operations.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets the cleanup interval to `-1m` (negative one minute), which is an invalid configuration and likely used for testing purposes.

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Value | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------|:------------|
| authentication.required | boolean | true | Indicates that authentication is mandatory |
| authentication.methods.token.enabled | boolean | true | Enables token-based authentication |
| authentication.methods.token.cleanup.interval | duration | -1m | Sets an invalid negative cleanup interval |

## TODOs
While there are no explicit TODOs in the code, the negative cleanup interval (-1m) is likely used for testing purposes and should not be used in a production environment. This configuration file appears to be specifically designed to test how the system handles invalid cleanup interval values.
