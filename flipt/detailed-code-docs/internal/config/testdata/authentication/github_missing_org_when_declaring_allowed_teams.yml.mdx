## High-level description
This YAML configuration file defines authentication settings for a system, specifically focusing on GitHub authentication. It includes general authentication requirements, session settings, and detailed GitHub authentication method configuration with organization and team restrictions.

## Symbols

### `authentication`
#### Description
The root configuration object for authentication settings.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets the overall authentication requirements
- Defines session parameters
- Specifies authentication methods, in this case, GitHub

### `authentication.required`
#### Description
A boolean flag indicating whether authentication is mandatory for the system.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| required | boolean | Determines if authentication is required |

### `authentication.session`
#### Description
Configures session-related settings for the authentication process.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets the domain for the session
- Configures the security setting for the session

### `authentication.methods.github`
#### Description
Configures the GitHub authentication method with various parameters and restrictions.

#### Internal Logic
- Enables or disables GitHub authentication
- Sets up GitHub OAuth application credentials
- Configures redirect address and required scopes
- Specifies allowed organizations and teams

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| authentication.required | boolean | true | Determines if authentication is mandatory |
| authentication.session.domain | string | "http://localhost:8080" | The domain for the authentication session |
| authentication.session.secure | boolean | false | Whether the session should be secure (likely for HTTPS) |
| authentication.methods.github.enabled | boolean | true | Enables GitHub authentication |
| authentication.methods.github.client_id | string | "client_id" | The GitHub OAuth application client ID |
| authentication.methods.github.client_secret | string | "client_secret" | The GitHub OAuth application client secret |
| authentication.methods.github.redirect_address | string | "http://localhost:8080" | The redirect address after GitHub authentication |
| authentication.methods.github.scopes | array of strings | ["read:org"] | The GitHub OAuth scopes required |
| authentication.methods.github.allowed_organizations | array of strings | ["my-org"] | List of allowed GitHub organizations |
| authentication.methods.github.allowed_teams | object | {"my-other-org": ["my-team"]} | Mapping of organizations to allowed teams |

## Error Handling
This configuration file does not explicitly handle errors. However, it's worth noting that there's a potential configuration error in the `allowed_teams` section. The organization "my-other-org" is specified under `allowed_teams`, but it's not listed in the `allowed_organizations` array. This inconsistency might lead to unexpected behavior or errors when the configuration is processed.

## TODOs
While there are no explicit TODOs in the code, the inconsistency between `allowed_organizations` and `allowed_teams` should be addressed. The organization "my-other-org" should either be added to the `allowed_organizations` list or removed from the `allowed_teams` section to ensure consistency and prevent potential issues.
