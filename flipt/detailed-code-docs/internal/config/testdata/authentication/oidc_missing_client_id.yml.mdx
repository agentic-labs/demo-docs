title: "oidc_missing_client_id.yml"
---

## High-level description
This YAML file is a configuration file for authentication settings, specifically focusing on OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication. It defines various authentication parameters, including session settings and OIDC provider configuration. However, it's important to note that this file is intentionally missing the `client_id` field for the OIDC provider, which is likely used for testing purposes.

## Symbols

### `authentication`
#### Description
The root configuration object for authentication settings.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets `required` to true, indicating that authentication is mandatory.
- Defines `session` and `methods` subsections for further configuration.

### `authentication.session`
#### Description
Configures session-related settings for authentication.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets the session `domain` to "http://localhost:8080".
- Sets `secure` to false, indicating that the session is not using HTTPS.

### `authentication.methods`
#### Description
Defines the authentication methods available, in this case, OIDC.

#### Internal Logic
- Contains an `oidc` subsection for OpenID Connect configuration.

### `authentication.methods.oidc`
#### Description
Configures the OpenID Connect authentication method.

#### Internal Logic
- Enables OIDC authentication by setting `enabled` to true.
- Defines a `providers` subsection for configuring OIDC providers.

### `authentication.methods.oidc.providers.foo`
#### Description
Configures a specific OIDC provider named "foo".

#### Internal Logic
- Sets the `client_secret` for the provider.
- Specifies the `redirect_address` for the OIDC flow.
- Defines the required `scopes` for authentication.

## Error Handling
This configuration file is intentionally missing the `client_id` field for the OIDC provider. This omission is likely used for testing error handling or validation in the authentication system. The system should detect and handle the missing `client_id` appropriately when parsing this configuration.

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| authentication.required | boolean | true | Indicates if authentication is mandatory |
| authentication.session.domain | string | "http://localhost:8080" | The domain for the authentication session |
| authentication.session.secure | boolean | false | Indicates if the session uses HTTPS |
| authentication.methods.oidc.enabled | boolean | true | Enables OIDC authentication |
| authentication.methods.oidc.providers.foo.client_secret | string | "client_secret" | The client secret for the OIDC provider |
| authentication.methods.oidc.providers.foo.redirect_address | string | "http://localhost:8080" | The redirect address for the OIDC flow |
| authentication.methods.oidc.providers.foo.scopes | array of strings | ["user:email"] | The required scopes for authentication |

Note: The `client_id` is intentionally missing from this configuration file.
