title: "token_bootstrap_token.yml"
---

## High-level description
This YAML configuration file defines authentication settings for a system, specifically focusing on token-based authentication with a bootstrap token. It enables authentication, sets up token-based authentication, and provides a bootstrap token with an expiration time.

## Symbols

### `authentication`
#### Description
The root configuration block for authentication settings.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets authentication as required for the system.
- Defines the authentication methods, specifically the token method.

### `authentication.methods.token`
#### Description
Configures the token-based authentication method.

#### Internal Logic
- Enables the token authentication method.
- Defines a bootstrap token configuration.

### `authentication.methods.token.bootstrap`
#### Description
Configures the bootstrap token settings.

#### Internal Logic
- Specifies a secret token value.
- Sets an expiration time for the bootstrap token.

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| authentication.required | boolean | true | Determines if authentication is mandatory for the system |
| authentication.methods.token.enabled | boolean | true | Enables or disables token-based authentication |
| authentication.methods.token.bootstrap.token | string | "s3cr3t!" | The secret bootstrap token value |
| authentication.methods.token.bootstrap.expiration | duration | 24h | The expiration time for the bootstrap token |

## Security Considerations
1. The bootstrap token "s3cr3t!" is hardcoded in this configuration file. In a production environment, it's crucial to use a more secure and randomly generated token.
2. The expiration time of 24 hours for the bootstrap token provides a time-limited window for initial system setup or recovery. After this period, the bootstrap token will no longer be valid.
3. Storing sensitive information like tokens in plain text configuration files is generally not recommended for production use. Consider using secure secret management solutions in real-world deployments.

This configuration file appears to be part of a test data set, as indicated by its location in the "testdata" directory. It's likely used for testing authentication mechanisms in the system, particularly the bootstrap token functionality.
