## Configuration

|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| ui.enabled | boolean | false | Determines whether the user interface is enabled or disabled |

This configuration file sets `ui.enabled` to `false`, which means the user interface is explicitly disabled in this configuration.

Note: As this file is located in a `deprecated` directory within the testdata, it suggests that this configuration format or the specific option of disabling the UI might be outdated or no longer supported in newer versions of the software. It's likely used for backwards compatibility testing or to ensure that deprecated configurations are still handled correctly by the system.
