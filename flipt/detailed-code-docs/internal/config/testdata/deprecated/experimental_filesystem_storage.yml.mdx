## Notes
1. This configuration file is located in a `testdata/deprecated` directory, which suggests that it might be used for testing purposes and that the feature or its configuration method may be deprecated.
2. The use of "experimental" in the configuration hierarchy implies that this feature is not yet considered stable or production-ready, and its behavior or existence may change in future versions of the software.
3. Users of this configuration should be aware that enabling experimental features may lead to unexpected behavior or changes in future updates.
