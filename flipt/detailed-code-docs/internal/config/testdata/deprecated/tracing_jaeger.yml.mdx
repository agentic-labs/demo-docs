title: "tracing_jaeger.yml"
---

## High-level description
This YAML configuration file defines tracing settings for a system, specifically enabling tracing and setting the exporter to "jaeger". It appears to be a deprecated configuration file, as indicated by its location in the "deprecated" directory.

## Symbols

### `tracing`
#### Description
The `tracing` key is the root-level configuration object for tracing-related settings.

#### Internal Logic
The `tracing` object contains two key-value pairs:
1. `enabled`: A boolean value set to `true`, which indicates that tracing is enabled.
2. `exporter`: A string value set to "jaeger", specifying the tracing exporter to be used.

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| tracing.enabled | boolean | true | Enables or disables tracing functionality |
| tracing.exporter | string | "jaeger" | Specifies the tracing exporter to be used |

## Dependencies
While not explicitly stated in the file, this configuration implies a dependency on Jaeger, a popular open-source distributed tracing system.
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Jaeger | Distributed tracing system used as the exporter for tracing data |

## Notes
1. This configuration file is located in a "deprecated" directory, suggesting that this particular way of configuring tracing might be outdated or no longer recommended.
2. The use of Jaeger as the exporter indicates that this configuration is intended for a distributed tracing setup, which is commonly used in microservices architectures to monitor and troubleshoot complex distributed systems.
3. The simplicity of this configuration suggests that it might be a basic or example setup, and more detailed configuration options might be available in other files or through different means.
