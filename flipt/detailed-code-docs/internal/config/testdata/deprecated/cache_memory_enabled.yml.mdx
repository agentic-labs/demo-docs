## Notes
1. This configuration file is located in a `deprecated` directory, which suggests that this particular configuration structure or the use of memory cache in this manner might be outdated or no longer recommended.
2. The use of a negative duration (-1s) for expiration is a common convention to indicate that cached items should not expire.
3. This configuration is likely part of a larger system that uses YAML for configuration management, possibly related to caching strategies in an application or service.
