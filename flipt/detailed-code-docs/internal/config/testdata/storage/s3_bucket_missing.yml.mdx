## High-level description
This YAML configuration file defines a storage configuration for an object storage system. Specifically, it sets up an S3-type object storage without specifying the bucket name, which is a crucial piece of information for S3 storage.

## Symbols

### `storage`
#### Description
The `storage` key is the root-level configuration for defining the storage system.

#### Internal Logic
It contains two nested keys: `type` and `object`, which further specify the storage configuration.

### `storage.type`
#### Description
Specifies the general type of storage being configured.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| type | string | Set to "object", indicating that this configuration is for object storage. |

### `storage.object`
#### Description
Contains the specific configuration for the object storage.

#### Internal Logic
It has a single nested key `type` that specifies the particular object storage service to be used.

### `storage.object.type`
#### Description
Specifies the specific type of object storage service.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| type | string | Set to "s3", indicating that the object storage service to be used is Amazon S3 or an S3-compatible service. |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| storage.type | string | "object" | Specifies that the storage type is object storage. |
| storage.object.type | string | "s3" | Specifies that the object storage service is S3. |

## TODOs
While not explicitly stated in the file, there is a notable omission in this configuration. For a complete S3 configuration, a bucket name should typically be specified. The absence of a bucket name in this configuration suggests that this file might be intentionally set up to test error handling or validation for cases where required S3 configuration parameters are missing.
