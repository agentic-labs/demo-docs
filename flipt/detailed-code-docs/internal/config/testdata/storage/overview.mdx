## High-level description
This directory contains YAML configuration files for various storage types used in a larger application or system. The files define settings for different storage backends, including local storage, Git repositories, object storage (S3, Azure Blob, Google Cloud Storage), and OCI (Open Container Initiative) repositories.

## What does it do?
These configuration files serve as test data for the storage configuration system of the application. They define how the application should interact with different storage backends, specifying details such as:

1. Storage type (e.g., local, Git, object storage, OCI)
2. Repository URLs or bucket names
3. Authentication credentials
4. Polling intervals for checking updates
5. Local directories for storing data

Some files are intentionally invalid or incomplete to test error handling and validation in the configuration parsing system.

## Key Files

1. `local_provided.yml`: Defines a simple local storage configuration.

2. `git_provided.yml`: Configures Git repository storage with basic settings.

3. `s3_full.yml`: Provides a complete configuration for Amazon S3 storage, including bucket name, prefix, region, and polling interval.

4. `azblob_full.yml`: Configures Azure Blob storage with container name, endpoint, and polling interval.

5. `gs_full.yml`: Sets up Google Cloud Storage with bucket name, prefix, and polling interval.

6. `oci_provided_full.yml`: Defines a complete OCI repository configuration, including authentication and manifest version.

7. Invalid configuration files:
   - `git_invalid_ref_type.yml`: Contains an invalid Git reference type.
   - `s3_bucket_missing.yml`: Omits the required S3 bucket name.
   - `oci_invalid_manifest_version.yml`: Specifies an invalid OCI manifest version.
   - `oci_provided_invalid_auth.yml`: Includes an invalid authentication type for OCI.

These files collectively cover various scenarios and edge cases for storage configuration, allowing thorough testing of the application's ability to parse, validate, and handle different storage setups.

## Configuration
Common configuration options across different storage types include:

1. `storage.type`: Specifies the general storage type (e.g., "object", "git", "oci").
2. `repository` or `bucket`: Defines the target storage location.
3. `authentication`: Provides credentials for accessing the storage (when applicable).
4. `poll_interval`: Sets the frequency for checking updates in the storage.
5. `bundles_directory`: Specifies a local directory for storing data (in some configurations).

Specific storage types may have additional options, such as:

- Git: `ref_type` for specifying branch, tag, or commit.
- Object storage: `prefix` for organizing objects within a bucket.
- OCI: `manifest_version` for specifying the OCI manifest version to use.

These configuration files are crucial for testing the application's ability to handle various storage backends and ensure proper functionality across different storage scenarios.
