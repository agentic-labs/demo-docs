## High-level description
This YAML file defines the configuration for an OCI (Open Container Initiative) storage type. It specifies the repository, authentication details, and other settings for managing bundles in an OCI-compliant storage system.

## Configuration
The configuration options defined in this YAML file are as follows:

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| storage.type | string | "oci" | Specifies the storage type as OCI |
| storage.oci.repository | string | "some.target/repository/abundle:latest" | The OCI repository URL for storing bundles |
| storage.oci.bundles_directory | string | "/tmp/bundles" | The local directory path for storing bundles |
| storage.oci.authentication.username | string | "foo" | The username for authenticating with the OCI repository |
| storage.oci.authentication.password | string | "bar" | The password for authenticating with the OCI repository |
| storage.oci.poll_interval | duration | "5m" | The interval for polling the OCI repository for updates |

This configuration file is likely used as test data for the internal configuration system of an application that interacts with OCI-compliant storage. It provides a complete example of how to configure OCI storage with authentication and polling settings.

The file is located in the `internal/config/testdata/storage/` directory, which suggests it's used for testing purposes related to storage configuration parsing or validation.

Note: In a real-world scenario, sensitive information like passwords should not be stored in plain text in configuration files. This example is likely simplified for testing purposes.
