title: "azblob_invalid.yml"
---

## High-level description
This YAML file represents an invalid configuration for Azure Blob storage within a larger storage configuration. It defines the storage type as "object" and specifies Azure Blob ("azblob") as the object storage type, but lacks the necessary credentials and other required settings.

## Symbols

### `storage`
#### Description
The root configuration key for defining storage settings.

#### Internal Logic
- Specifies the storage type as "object", indicating that object storage is being configured.

### `storage.object`
#### Description
Defines the specific object storage configuration.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets the object storage type to "azblob", indicating Azure Blob storage.

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| storage.type | string | N/A | Specifies the storage type as "object" |
| storage.object.type | string | N/A | Specifies the object storage type as "azblob" (Azure Blob) |

## Error Handling
This configuration file is intentionally invalid and incomplete. It lacks essential settings for Azure Blob storage, such as account name, account key, and container name. Attempting to use this configuration would likely result in errors when trying to connect to Azure Blob storage.

## TODOs
While not explicitly stated in the file, this configuration is incomplete and would need to be expanded with the following information for valid Azure Blob storage configuration:
1. Azure storage account name
2. Azure storage account key or SAS token
3. Container name
4. Optional: Custom endpoint for Azure Blob storage
5. Optional: Additional settings like max connections, timeout values, etc.
