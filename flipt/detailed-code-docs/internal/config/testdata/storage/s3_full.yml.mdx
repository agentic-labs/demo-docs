## High-level description
This YAML configuration file defines storage settings for an S3 (Amazon Simple Storage Service) object storage system. It specifies the storage type, bucket name, prefix, region, and polling interval for S3 interactions.

## Symbols

### `storage`
#### Description
The root configuration block that defines the storage settings for the application.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets the storage type to "object"
- Specifies further details for the object storage configuration

### `storage.object`
#### Description
Defines the specific type of object storage to be used.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets the object storage type to "s3"

### `storage.object.s3`
#### Description
Contains the detailed configuration for Amazon S3 storage.

#### Internal Logic
- Specifies four key parameters for S3 interaction:
  1. `bucket`: The name of the S3 bucket to be used
  2. `prefix`: A prefix to be applied to objects within the bucket
  3. `region`: The AWS region where the S3 bucket is located
  4. `poll_interval`: The frequency at which to check for changes in the S3 bucket

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| storage.type | string | "object" | Specifies the storage type as object storage |
| storage.object.type | string | "s3" | Specifies the object storage type as S3 |
| storage.object.s3.bucket | string | "testbucket" | The name of the S3 bucket to be used |
| storage.object.s3.prefix | string | "prefix" | A prefix to be applied to objects within the bucket |
| storage.object.s3.region | string | "region" | The AWS region where the S3 bucket is located |
| storage.object.s3.poll_interval | string | "5m" | The interval at which to check for changes in the S3 bucket |

This configuration file is likely used as test data for a larger application that interacts with S3 storage. The "testdata" in the file path suggests that this configuration might be used in unit tests or integration tests to verify the correct handling of S3 storage settings.
