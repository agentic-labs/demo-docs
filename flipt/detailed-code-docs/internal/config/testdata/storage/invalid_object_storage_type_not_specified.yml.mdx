title: "invalid_object_storage_type_not_specified.yml"
---

## High-level description
This YAML file represents an invalid configuration for object storage. It demonstrates a scenario where the storage type is specified as "object" but lacks the necessary details to define the specific object storage type.

## Symbols

### `storage`
#### Description
The `storage` key is the root-level configuration element for defining storage settings in the system.

#### Internal Logic
The `storage` configuration is incomplete and invalid because it only specifies the general type as "object" without providing the required details for a specific object storage implementation.

### `type`
#### Description
The `type` key, nested under `storage`, specifies the general category of storage to be used.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| type | string | The general category of storage |

#### Internal Logic
In this case, the `type` is set to "object", indicating that object storage should be used. However, this configuration is insufficient as it doesn't specify which particular object storage service or implementation should be employed.

## Error Handling
This configuration file is intentionally invalid and would likely cause an error when parsed by the application. The error would probably indicate that the object storage type is not specified or that the configuration is incomplete.

## TODOs
While there are no explicit TODOs in the file, the configuration is incomplete and would need to be extended to include the specific object storage type and its associated configuration details.
