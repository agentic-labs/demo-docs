title: "git_basic_auth_invalid.yml"
---

## High-level description
This YAML configuration file defines storage settings for a Git repository. It specifies the use of Git as the storage type and attempts to set up basic authentication for the repository. However, the configuration is incomplete as it's missing the password for basic authentication.

## Symbols

### `storage`
#### Description
The root configuration block that defines the storage settings for the application.

#### Internal Logic
- Specifies the storage type as "git"
- Contains a nested `git` block for Git-specific configurations

### `storage.type`
#### Description
Defines the type of storage to be used.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| type | string | The type of storage, set to "git" |

### `storage.git`
#### Description
Contains Git-specific configuration settings.

#### Internal Logic
- Specifies the repository URL
- Includes an `authentication` block for setting up access credentials

### `storage.git.repository`
#### Description
Specifies the URL of the Git repository to be used for storage.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| repository | string | The SSH URL of the Git repository |

### `storage.git.authentication`
#### Description
Defines the authentication method and credentials for accessing the Git repository.

#### Internal Logic
- Uses the `basic` authentication method
- Contains a nested `basic` block for username and password (incomplete in this case)

### `storage.git.authentication.basic`
#### Description
Specifies the credentials for basic authentication.

#### Internal Logic
- Provides the username for basic authentication
- Missing the password field, which is required for valid basic authentication

### `storage.git.authentication.basic.username`
#### Description
Specifies the username for basic authentication to the Git repository.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| username | string | The username for basic authentication, set to "foo" |

## Error Handling
This configuration file is likely to cause an error when used, as it's missing the required password field for basic authentication. The system using this configuration should validate the presence of both username and password fields when basic authentication is specified.

## TODOs
1. Add the missing `password` field under the `basic` authentication block to complete the basic authentication configuration.
2. Consider using a more secure authentication method, such as SSH keys, instead of basic authentication for better security.
