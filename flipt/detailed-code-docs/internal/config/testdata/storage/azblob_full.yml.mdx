## High-level description
This YAML configuration file defines storage settings for an Azure Blob Storage container. It specifies the storage type as "object" and further details the object storage type as "azblob" (Azure Blob Storage) with specific configuration parameters.

## Symbols

### `storage`
#### Description
The root configuration block that defines the storage settings for the application.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets the storage type to "object"
- Contains nested configuration for object storage

### `storage.object`
#### Description
Specifies the type of object storage to be used.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets the object storage type to "azblob" (Azure Blob Storage)

### `storage.object.azblob`
#### Description
Configures the specific settings for Azure Blob Storage.

#### Internal Logic
Defines three key parameters for Azure Blob Storage:
1. `container`: Specifies the name of the Azure Blob container to be used
2. `endpoint`: Provides the URL endpoint for the Azure Blob Storage account
3. `poll_interval`: Sets the interval for polling the storage for changes

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Value | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------|:------------|
| storage.type | string | "object" | Specifies the storage type as object storage |
| storage.object.type | string | "azblob" | Specifies Azure Blob Storage as the object storage type |
| storage.object.azblob.container | string | "testdata" | Name of the Azure Blob container |
| storage.object.azblob.endpoint | string | "https//devaccount.blob.core.windows.net" | URL endpoint for the Azure Blob Storage account |
| storage.object.azblob.poll_interval | string | "5m" | Interval for polling the storage (5 minutes) |

## Notes
- The file is located in a testdata directory, suggesting it's used for testing purposes.
- The endpoint URL appears to have a typo: it's missing a colon after "https". The correct format should be "https://devaccount.blob.core.windows.net".
- The poll_interval is set to "5m", which typically represents 5 minutes in duration notation.
