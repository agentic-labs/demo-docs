title: "disabled.yml"

## High-level description
This YAML configuration file is used to define metrics settings for a system. It specifically disables metrics collection while specifying Prometheus as the exporter.

## Symbols

### `metrics`
#### Description
The `metrics` key is the root-level configuration object for metrics-related settings.

#### Internal Logic
The `metrics` object contains two key-value pairs:
1. `enabled`: Set to `false`, indicating that metrics collection is disabled.
2. `exporter`: Set to `prometheus`, specifying Prometheus as the intended exporter for metrics data.

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| metrics.enabled | boolean | false | Determines whether metrics collection is enabled or disabled |
| metrics.exporter | string | "prometheus" | Specifies the exporter to be used for metrics data |

This configuration file serves as a test data file (as indicated by its location in the `testdata` directory) that represents a scenario where metrics collection is disabled. It may be used in unit tests or integration tests to verify that the system behaves correctly when metrics are turned off, even though an exporter (Prometheus) is specified.
