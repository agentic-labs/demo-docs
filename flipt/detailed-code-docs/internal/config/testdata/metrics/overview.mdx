## High-level description
This directory contains YAML configuration files for metrics settings in a system. These files are located in the testdata directory, suggesting they are used for testing purposes. The configurations demonstrate different scenarios for metrics collection and exportation, specifically focusing on enabling/disabling metrics and configuring different exporters.

## What does it do?
The configuration files in this directory define how metrics should be collected and exported in the system. They allow developers to:

1. Enable or disable metrics collection.
2. Specify which exporter should be used for metrics data (e.g., Prometheus or OpenTelemetry Protocol).
3. Configure specific settings for the chosen exporter, such as endpoints and authentication headers.

These configurations help control the behavior of the metrics subsystem during testing, allowing developers to verify that the system responds correctly to different metrics settings.

## Key Files

1. `disabled.yml`:
   This file configures a scenario where metrics collection is disabled. It sets `metrics.enabled` to `false` while still specifying Prometheus as the exporter. This configuration is useful for testing how the system behaves when metrics are turned off.

   ```yaml
   metrics:
     enabled: false
     exporter: prometheus
   ```

2. `otlp.yml`:
   This file configures metrics collection using the OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) exporter. It enables metrics collection and provides detailed settings for the OTLP exporter, including a custom endpoint and authentication header.

   ```yaml
   metrics:
     enabled: true
     exporter: otlp
     otlp:
       endpoint: "http://localhost:9999"
       headers:
         api-key: "test-key"
   ```

## Configuration
The configuration files in this directory use the following structure and options:

| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| metrics.enabled | boolean | Determines whether metrics collection is enabled or disabled |
| metrics.exporter | string | Specifies the exporter to be used for metrics data (e.g., "prometheus" or "otlp") |
| metrics.otlp.endpoint | string | (OTLP only) The endpoint URL for the OTLP exporter |
| metrics.otlp.headers | object | (OTLP only) Custom headers for OTLP exporter requests |
| metrics.otlp.headers.api-key | string | (OTLP only) The API key for authenticating with the OTLP endpoint |

These configuration files allow developers to test different scenarios:

1. Metrics disabled: Using the `disabled.yml` file, developers can verify that the system correctly handles a configuration where metrics are turned off, even when an exporter is specified.

2. OTLP exporter: The `otlp.yml` file allows testing of the OpenTelemetry Protocol exporter configuration, including custom endpoint and authentication settings.

By providing these different configurations in the testdata directory, developers can easily switch between scenarios during testing to ensure the metrics subsystem behaves correctly under various settings.
