title: "https_not_found_cert_key.yml"
---

## High-level description
This YAML file is a configuration file for a server, specifically focusing on HTTPS settings. It defines server properties including protocol, host, ports, and SSL certificate files. Most other configuration sections are commented out, emphasizing the server's HTTPS setup.

## Symbols

### server
#### Description
The `server` section configures the main server settings, particularly for HTTPS communication.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| protocol | string | Specifies the server protocol (set to "https") |
| host | string | Defines the server's host address |
| https_port | integer | Specifies the port for HTTPS traffic |
| http_port | integer | Specifies the port for HTTP traffic |
| grpc_port | integer | Specifies the port for gRPC communication |
| cert_file | string | Path to the SSL certificate file |
| cert_key | string | Path to the SSL certificate key file |

#### Internal Logic
The server is configured to use HTTPS protocol, listening on all available network interfaces (0.0.0.0). It sets up ports for HTTPS (443), HTTP (8080), and gRPC (9000) communication. The SSL certificate file is specified, but notably, the certificate key file path points to a non-existent file ("./testdata/ssl_cert_not_exist.key").

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| server.protocol | string | https | Defines the server communication protocol |
| server.host | string | 0.0.0.0 | Sets the server's host address |
| server.https_port | integer | 443 | Specifies the HTTPS port |
| server.http_port | integer | 8080 | Specifies the HTTP port |
| server.grpc_port | integer | 9000 | Specifies the gRPC port |
| server.cert_file | string | "./testdata/ssl_cert.pem" | Path to the SSL certificate file |
| server.cert_key | string | "./testdata/ssl_cert_not_exist.key" | Path to the SSL certificate key file (non-existent) |

## Notes
1. Most configuration sections (log, ui, cors, cache, db) are commented out, focusing the configuration on server settings.
2. The `cert_key` file is intentionally set to a non-existent path ("./testdata/ssl_cert_not_exist.key"), which may be part of a test scenario to handle missing certificate key files.
3. The configuration uses standard ports for HTTPS (443) and gRPC (9000), with a non-standard port for HTTP (8080).
4. The server is set to listen on all available network interfaces (0.0.0.0), which allows connections from any IP address.

This configuration appears to be a test setup, particularly for testing server behavior when the SSL certificate key file is not found, while other HTTPS settings are properly configured.
