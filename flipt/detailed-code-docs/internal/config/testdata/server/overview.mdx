## High-level description
This directory contains YAML configuration files for server settings, primarily focusing on HTTPS and cloud functionality. These files are likely used for testing various server configurations and error handling scenarios.

## What does it do?
The configuration files in this directory define different server setups, including:

1. Cloud functionality settings
2. gRPC connection parameters
3. HTTPS protocol configurations
4. SSL certificate and key file settings

These files are designed to test various scenarios, such as missing ports, invalid certificate paths, and specific gRPC connection settings. They help ensure that the server can handle different configurations and error conditions properly.

## Key Files

1. `cloud_missing_port.yml`: Configures cloud functionality for both server and experimental features but intentionally omits the port configuration.

2. `grpc_keepalive.yml`: Focuses on gRPC connection parameters, setting specific timeouts and durations for managing gRPC connections.

3. `https_missing_cert_file.yml`: Configures HTTPS protocol settings but intentionally omits the certificate file path.

4. `https_missing_cert_key.yml`: Sets up HTTPS configuration with a certificate file path but lacks the private key file specification.

5. `https_not_found_cert_file.yml`: Configures HTTPS settings with non-existent SSL certificate file paths to test error handling.

6. `https_not_found_cert_key.yml`: Similar to the previous file, but specifically uses a non-existent path for the SSL certificate key file.

## Configuration
The configuration files in this directory share a common structure with the following main sections:

1. `server`: Defines server-specific settings such as protocol, host, ports, and SSL certificate paths.
2. `experimental`: Contains settings for experimental features (only present in `cloud_missing_port.yml`).

Common configuration options across the files include:

| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| server.protocol | string | Specifies the server protocol (e.g., "https") |
| server.host | string | Defines the server's host address (usually "0.0.0.0") |
| server.https_port | integer | Specifies the HTTPS port (typically 443) |
| server.http_port | integer | Specifies the HTTP port (typically 8080) |
| server.grpc_port | integer | Specifies the gRPC port (typically 9000) |
| server.cert_file | string | Path to the SSL certificate file |
| server.cert_key | string | Path to the SSL certificate key file |

Additional configuration options are present in specific files:

1. In `cloud_missing_port.yml`:
   - `server.cloud.enabled`: Enables cloud functionality for the server
   - `experimental.cloud.enabled`: Enables experimental cloud functionality

2. In `grpc_keepalive.yml`:
   - `server.grpc_conn_max_idle_time`: Maximum idle time for gRPC connections
   - `server.grpc_conn_max_age`: Maximum age of gRPC connections
   - `server.grpc_conn_max_age_grace`: Grace period for closing aged gRPC connections

It's worth noting that most files have commented-out sections for additional configuration options such as logging, UI settings, CORS, caching, and database configurations. These commented sections provide insight into other configurable aspects of the system that might be used in production environments.

The configuration files in this directory are designed to test specific scenarios and error handling in the server implementation. They intentionally include missing or invalid settings to ensure the server can properly detect and respond to configuration issues.
