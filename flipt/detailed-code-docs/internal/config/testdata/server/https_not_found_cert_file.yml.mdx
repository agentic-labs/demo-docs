title: "https_not_found_cert_file.yml"
---

## High-level description
This YAML file contains configuration settings for a server, specifically focusing on HTTPS setup with non-existent SSL certificate files. It's likely used for testing scenarios where the server is configured with invalid certificate paths.

## Symbols

### server
#### Description
Defines the server configuration, including protocol, host, ports, and SSL certificate file paths.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| protocol | string | Specifies the server protocol (https) |
| host | string | Defines the server host IP address |
| https_port | integer | Specifies the HTTPS port number |
| http_port | integer | Specifies the HTTP port number |
| grpc_port | integer | Specifies the gRPC port number |
| cert_file | string | Path to the SSL certificate file (non-existent in this case) |
| cert_key | string | Path to the SSL certificate key file (non-existent in this case) |

#### Internal Logic
The server is configured to use HTTPS protocol on all interfaces (0.0.0.0) with HTTPS port 443, HTTP port 8080, and gRPC port 9000. It attempts to use SSL certificate files that do not exist, which is likely intentional for testing purposes.

## Side Effects
Using non-existent SSL certificate files will cause the server to fail to start or operate in HTTPS mode, which is probably the intended behavior for testing error handling or configuration validation.

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| server.protocol | string | https | Defines the server protocol |
| server.host | string | 0.0.0.0 | Specifies the server host IP address |
| server.https_port | integer | 443 | Sets the HTTPS port |
| server.http_port | integer | 8080 | Sets the HTTP port |
| server.grpc_port | integer | 9000 | Sets the gRPC port |
| server.cert_file | string | "./testdata/ssl_cert_not_exist.pem" | Path to non-existent SSL certificate file |
| server.cert_key | string | "./testdata/ssl_cert_not_exist.key" | Path to non-existent SSL certificate key file |

## TODOs
The file contains several commented-out sections that might be used in other configurations or could be enabled for different testing scenarios:
1. Logging configuration (log)
2. UI settings (ui)
3. CORS settings (cors)
4. Cache configuration (cache)
5. Database settings (db)

These commented sections suggest that the configuration file is part of a larger system with various configurable components, but for this specific test case, only the server settings are active.
