title: "https_missing_cert_file.yml"
---

## High-level description
This YAML file contains configuration settings for a server, specifically focusing on HTTPS protocol setup. It demonstrates a scenario where the HTTPS certificate file is missing, which is crucial for secure HTTPS connections.

## Code Structure
The YAML file is structured with various configuration sections, most of which are commented out. The only active section is the `server` configuration.

## Symbols

### server
#### Description
This section defines the server configuration, specifying the protocol, host, and various port settings.

#### Internal Logic
The server is configured to use HTTPS protocol (`protocol: https`) and listen on all available network interfaces (`host: 0.0.0.0`). It specifies ports for HTTPS, HTTP, and gRPC connections.

| Option | Type | Value | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------|:------------|
| protocol | string | https | Specifies the server protocol as HTTPS |
| host | string | 0.0.0.0 | Sets the server to listen on all available network interfaces |
| https_port | integer | 443 | Defines the port for HTTPS connections (standard HTTPS port) |
| http_port | integer | 8080 | Defines the port for HTTP connections |
| grpc_port | integer | 9000 | Defines the port for gRPC connections |

## Configuration
This file represents a partial configuration with most sections commented out. The active configuration focuses on server settings, particularly HTTPS setup.

| Section | Status | Description |
|:--------|:-------|:------------|
| log | Commented | Logging configuration (level for general and gRPC logging) |
| ui | Commented | User interface settings |
| cors | Commented | Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) configuration |
| cache | Commented | Caching settings (backend, TTL, memory eviction) |
| server | Active | Server protocol and port configurations |
| db | Commented | Database configuration |

## Error Handling
The file name (`https_missing_cert_file.yml`) suggests that this configuration is intentionally missing the certificate file required for HTTPS. This could be used in testing scenarios to verify proper error handling when a required HTTPS certificate is not provided.

## TODOs
While there are no explicit TODOs in the file, the numerous commented-out sections suggest that this configuration might be a work in progress or a specific test case focusing only on the server HTTPS setup.
