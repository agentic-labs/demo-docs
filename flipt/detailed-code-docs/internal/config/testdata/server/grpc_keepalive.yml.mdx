title: "grpc_keepalive.yml"
---

## High-level description
This YAML file contains configuration settings for a server, specifically focusing on gRPC connection parameters. It is part of a larger configuration structure, with most sections commented out, leaving only the `server` section active with gRPC-related settings.

## Symbols

### server
#### Description
The `server` section defines configuration options for the server, particularly gRPC connection parameters.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| grpc_conn_max_idle_time | duration | Maximum idle time for gRPC connections |
| grpc_conn_max_age | duration | Maximum age of gRPC connections |
| grpc_conn_max_age_grace | duration | Grace period for closing aged gRPC connections |

#### Internal Logic
The server configuration sets specific timeouts and durations for managing gRPC connections:
1. `grpc_conn_max_idle_time` is set to 1 hour, defining the maximum time a connection can remain idle before being closed.
2. `grpc_conn_max_age` is set to 30 seconds, specifying the maximum lifetime of a connection.
3. `grpc_conn_max_age_grace` is set to 10 seconds, providing a grace period for closing connections that have reached their maximum age.

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| grpc_conn_max_idle_time | duration | 1h | Maximum idle time for gRPC connections |
| grpc_conn_max_age | duration | 30s | Maximum age of gRPC connections |
| grpc_conn_max_age_grace | duration | 10s | Grace period for closing aged gRPC connections |

## Notes
1. This configuration file is located in a testdata directory, suggesting it's used for testing purposes.
2. Most sections of the configuration are commented out, including log, ui, cors, cache, and db settings. Only the server section with gRPC-specific settings is active.
3. The commented-out sections provide insight into other configurable aspects of the system, such as logging levels, UI enablement, CORS settings, caching options, and database configuration.
4. The server section also has commented-out options for protocol, host, and various port settings, indicating that these can be configured in a production environment.

This configuration file appears to be a subset of a larger configuration structure, focused on gRPC connection management for testing or specific deployment scenarios.
