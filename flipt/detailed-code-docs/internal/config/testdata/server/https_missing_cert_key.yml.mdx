title: "https_missing_cert_key.yml"

## High-level description
This YAML file is a configuration file for a server, specifically focusing on HTTPS settings. It defines server-related configurations, including the protocol, host, ports, and SSL certificate file path. Other sections of the configuration are commented out, suggesting they are either optional or not currently in use.

## Symbols

### server
#### Description
The `server` section defines the configuration for the server component of the application.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| protocol | string | Specifies the protocol used by the server (set to "https") |
| host | string | Defines the host IP address the server will bind to |
| https_port | integer | Specifies the port number for HTTPS connections |
| http_port | integer | Specifies the port number for HTTP connections |
| grpc_port | integer | Specifies the port number for gRPC connections |
| cert_file | string | Specifies the path to the SSL certificate file |

#### Internal Logic
The server is configured to use HTTPS protocol, listening on all available network interfaces (0.0.0.0). It sets up three different ports for various types of connections: HTTPS (443), HTTP (8080), and gRPC (9000). The SSL certificate file path is specified, but notably, there is no key file specified in this configuration.

## Side Effects
The configuration, when applied, will affect the server's behavior, including which protocols it uses, which ports it listens on, and how it handles SSL/TLS connections.

## Dependencies
This configuration file doesn't explicitly list any external dependencies. However, it implies that the application using this configuration should be capable of handling HTTPS, HTTP, and gRPC protocols.

## Configuration
The main configuration options defined in this file are:

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| server.protocol | string | https | The protocol used by the server |
| server.host | string | 0.0.0.0 | The host IP address the server binds to |
| server.https_port | integer | 443 | The port number for HTTPS connections |
| server.http_port | integer | 8080 | The port number for HTTP connections |
| server.grpc_port | integer | 9000 | The port number for gRPC connections |
| server.cert_file | string | "./testdata/ssl_cert.pem" | The path to the SSL certificate file |

## TODOs
While not explicitly marked as TODOs, the commented-out sections (log, ui, cors, cache, db) suggest that these configurations might be implemented or uncommented in the future as needed.

## Notes
1. The file name "https_missing_cert_key.yml" suggests that this configuration is intentionally missing the private key file for the SSL certificate. This could be for testing purposes or to demonstrate an incomplete HTTPS setup.
2. Most of the configuration options are commented out, leaving only the server section active. This might indicate a minimal or focused configuration for specific testing or development scenarios.
3. The use of HTTPS protocol without a specified key file may lead to issues when attempting to start the server with this configuration. Typically, both a certificate file and a key file are required for proper HTTPS setup.
