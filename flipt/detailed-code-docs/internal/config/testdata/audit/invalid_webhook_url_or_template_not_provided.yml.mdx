title: "invalid_webhook_url_or_template_not_provided.yml"
---

## High-level description
This YAML configuration file is part of an audit system and defines settings for a webhook sink. The file specifically demonstrates an invalid configuration where the webhook is enabled but essential details like the URL or template are not provided.

## Symbols

### `audit`
#### Description
The top-level key that encompasses all audit-related configurations.

### `audit.sinks`
#### Description
A sub-key under `audit` that defines various sinks (destinations) for audit data.

### `audit.sinks.webhook`
#### Description
Specifies the configuration for a webhook sink within the audit system.

#### Internal Logic
The webhook sink is enabled (`enabled: true`), but the configuration is incomplete as it lacks essential information such as the webhook URL or a template for formatting the data.

## Error Handling
This configuration file represents an invalid state. While it doesn't explicitly handle errors, it serves as a test case for the system's configuration validation. The system should detect that although the webhook sink is enabled, it lacks the necessary URL or template information to function correctly.

## TODOs
The configuration is intentionally incomplete for testing purposes. In a valid configuration, the following elements would typically be required:
1. A webhook URL
2. Potentially a template for formatting the audit data

Note: This file is likely used in a test suite to verify that the configuration system correctly identifies and handles incomplete or invalid webhook sink configurations.
