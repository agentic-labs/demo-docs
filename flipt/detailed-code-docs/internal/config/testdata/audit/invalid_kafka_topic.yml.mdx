## High-level description
This YAML file is a configuration file for audit settings, specifically focusing on Kafka as a sink. It demonstrates an invalid configuration where Kafka is enabled as an audit sink but lacks necessary configuration details.

## Symbols

### `audit`
#### Description
The top-level configuration key for audit-related settings.

### `sinks`
#### Description
A sub-key under `audit` that specifies different output destinations for audit data.

### `kafka`
#### Description
A specific sink type under `sinks`, representing Kafka as an audit data destination.

### `enabled`
#### Description
A boolean flag under `kafka` that indicates whether Kafka should be used as an audit sink.

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| audit.sinks.kafka.enabled | boolean | true | Enables or disables Kafka as an audit sink |

## Error Handling
This configuration file is intentionally invalid, as it lacks necessary details for a complete Kafka sink configuration. It's likely used in test scenarios to verify proper handling of incomplete configurations.

## TODOs
While there are no explicit TODOs in the file, the configuration is incomplete. A valid Kafka sink configuration would typically include additional parameters such as:
- Kafka broker addresses
- Topic name
- Authentication details (if required)
- Message format specifications

These missing details make this configuration invalid for actual use and suggest it's intended for testing error handling or validation in the system that processes this configuration.
