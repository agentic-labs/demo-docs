title: "invalid_buffer_capacity.yml"
---

## High-level description
This YAML configuration file defines settings for an audit system. It specifies the configuration for audit sinks and buffer settings, including an invalid buffer capacity value.

## Symbols

### `audit`
#### Description
The root configuration object for the audit system.

#### Internal Logic
The `audit` object contains two main sections: `sinks` and `buffer`.

### `audit.sinks`
#### Description
Defines the configuration for audit sinks, which are destinations for audit logs.

#### Internal Logic
Currently, only a log sink is defined.

### `audit.sinks.log`
#### Description
Configures a log-based audit sink.

#### Internal Logic
- `enabled`: Set to `true`, indicating that the log sink is active.
- `file`: Specifies the path to the log file as `./log.txt`.

### `audit.buffer`
#### Description
Configures the buffer settings for the audit system.

#### Internal Logic
- `capacity`: Set to 1000, which is likely an invalid value (as suggested by the filename).
- `flush_period`: Defines the period for flushing the buffer, set to 2 minutes.

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Value | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------|:------------|
| audit.sinks.log.enabled | boolean | true | Enables the log-based audit sink |
| audit.sinks.log.file | string | ./log.txt | Specifies the path to the log file |
| audit.buffer.capacity | integer | 1000 | Sets the buffer capacity (likely invalid) |
| audit.buffer.flush_period | duration | 2m | Sets the buffer flush period to 2 minutes |

## Error Handling
The filename "invalid_buffer_capacity.yml" suggests that this configuration file is intentionally set up with an invalid buffer capacity value. This could be used for testing error handling in the system that processes this configuration.
