## High-level description
This directory contains YAML configuration files for an audit system, specifically focusing on various sink configurations and error cases. The files are likely used for testing purposes, as they are located in a "testdata" directory and include both valid and invalid configurations.

## What does it do?
These configuration files define how the audit system should behave, particularly in terms of where and how audit logs are sent (sinks). They cover different scenarios such as:

1. Enabling logging without specifying a file
2. Setting up Kafka as a sink with various parameters
3. Configuring buffer settings for audit data
4. Setting up webhook sinks

The invalid configurations are intentionally included to test the system's ability to handle and report configuration errors properly.

## Key Files

1. `enable_without_file.yml`: Enables logging as an audit sink without specifying a file destination.

2. `invalid_buffer_capacity.yml`: Sets up a log sink and buffer configuration with an invalid buffer capacity.

3. `invalid_flush_period.yml`: Configures a log sink with an invalid buffer flush period.

4. `invalid_kafka_servers.yml`: Enables a Kafka sink but omits the required servers configuration.

5. `invalid_kafka_topic.yml`: Enables a Kafka sink without specifying a topic or servers.

6. `invalid_webhook_url_or_template_not_provided.yml`: Enables a webhook sink without providing the necessary URL or template.

7. `valid_kafka.yml`: Provides a complete and valid Kafka sink configuration.

## Configuration
The configuration files use a consistent YAML structure with the following main sections:

1. `audit`: The root configuration object for audit settings.
2. `audit.sinks`: Defines various output destinations for audit data.
3. `audit.buffer`: Configures buffer settings for audit data (when applicable).

Common configuration options include:

| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| audit.sinks.log.enabled | boolean | Enables or disables the log sink |
| audit.sinks.log.file | string | Specifies the log file path |
| audit.sinks.kafka.enabled | boolean | Enables or disables the Kafka sink |
| audit.sinks.kafka.topic | string | Specifies the Kafka topic for audit data |
| audit.sinks.kafka.bootstrap_servers | list of strings | Kafka server addresses |
| audit.sinks.webhook.enabled | boolean | Enables or disables the webhook sink |
| audit.buffer.capacity | integer | Sets the buffer capacity |
| audit.buffer.flush_period | duration | Sets the buffer flush period |

The `valid_kafka.yml` file provides the most comprehensive configuration, including additional Kafka-specific options such as authentication, encoding, and TLS settings.

## Error Handling
The invalid configuration files are designed to test the system's error handling capabilities. They include scenarios such as:

1. Missing required fields (e.g., Kafka servers or webhook URL)
2. Invalid values for buffer capacity and flush period
3. Incomplete configurations

The system processing these configurations should be able to detect these issues and handle them appropriately, either by raising errors or falling back to default values where applicable.

## Security Considerations
The `valid_kafka.yml` file includes some security-related configurations that warrant attention:

1. It uses plaintext credentials for Kafka authentication, which is not recommended for production environments.
2. It enables TLS (`require_tls: true`) but also allows skipping TLS verification (`insecure_skip_tls: true`), which could pose security risks.

In a production environment, it would be advisable to use secure methods for storing credentials and properly configure TLS without skipping verification.
