title: "invalid_flush_period.yml"
---

## High-level description
This YAML file represents an invalid configuration for an audit system. It defines audit settings, including a log sink and buffer configuration. The file is specifically designed to demonstrate an invalid flush period setting for testing purposes.

## Symbols

### `audit`
#### Description
The root configuration block for the audit system settings.

#### Internal Logic
Contains two main sub-sections: `sinks` and `buffer`.

___

### `audit.sinks`
#### Description
Defines the output destinations for audit data.

#### Internal Logic
Currently only includes a `log` sink configuration.

___

### `audit.sinks.log`
#### Description
Configures a log file sink for audit data.

#### Internal Logic
- `enabled`: Set to `true`, indicating that the log sink is active.
- `file`: Specifies the path to the log file (`./log.txt`).

___

### `audit.buffer`
#### Description
Configures the buffer settings for audit data.

#### Internal Logic
- `capacity`: Set to 2, likely indicating the number of audit events that can be held in the buffer.
- `flush_period`: Set to `30m`, which is likely an invalid value (probably too long) for the flush period.

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Value | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------|:------------|
| audit.sinks.log.enabled | boolean | true | Enables the log sink |
| audit.sinks.log.file | string | ./log.txt | Path to the log file |
| audit.buffer.capacity | integer | 2 | Capacity of the audit buffer |
| audit.buffer.flush_period | string | 30m | Flush period for the buffer (invalid value) |

## Error Handling
This file is intentionally configured with an invalid `flush_period` value (30m) to test error handling in the system that processes this configuration. The system should detect this invalid value and handle it appropriately, likely by raising an error or falling back to a default value.
