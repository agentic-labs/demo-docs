title: "valid_kafka.yml"

## High-level description
This YAML file contains configuration settings for an audit system that uses Kafka as a sink. It specifies various parameters for Kafka connectivity, authentication, and data encoding, enabling the audit system to send audit logs to a Kafka topic.

## Symbols

### `audit`
#### Description
The root configuration object for the audit system.

#### Internal Logic
Contains a nested `sinks` object, which further contains the `kafka` configuration.

### `audit.sinks.kafka`
#### Description
Configures the Kafka sink for the audit system.

#### Internal Logic
Defines multiple settings for connecting to and interacting with a Kafka cluster:

1. `enabled`: Activates the Kafka sink.
2. `topic`: Specifies the Kafka topic for audit logs.
3. `bootstrap_servers`: Lists Kafka server addresses.
4. `encoding`: Sets the data encoding format.
5. `authentication`: Provides credentials for Kafka access.
6. `schema_registry`: Configures the schema registry URL.
7. `require_tls`: Mandates TLS usage for connections.
8. `insecure_skip_tls`: Allows skipping TLS verification (insecure).

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| enabled | boolean | true | Enables or disables the Kafka sink |
| topic | string | "audit-topic" | The Kafka topic to which audit logs will be sent |
| bootstrap_servers | list of strings | ["kafka-srv1", "kafka-srv2"] | Kafka server addresses for initial connection |
| encoding | string | "protobuf" | The encoding format for audit log messages |
| authentication.username | string | "user" | Username for Kafka authentication |
| authentication.password | string | "passwd" | Password for Kafka authentication |
| schema_registry.url | string | "http://registry" | URL of the schema registry service |
| require_tls | boolean | true | Enforces TLS usage for Kafka connections |
| insecure_skip_tls | boolean | true | Allows skipping TLS certificate verification (insecure) |

## Security Considerations
1. The configuration includes both `require_tls: true` and `insecure_skip_tls: true`. This combination is potentially risky as it mandates TLS usage but also allows skipping TLS verification, which could expose the system to man-in-the-middle attacks.

2. The file contains plaintext credentials (`username` and `password`). In a production environment, it's recommended to use secure methods for storing and accessing sensitive information, such as environment variables or secure vaults.

3. The `insecure_skip_tls: true` setting should be used with caution, preferably only in development or testing environments. For production, it's advisable to properly configure TLS and set this to `false`.
