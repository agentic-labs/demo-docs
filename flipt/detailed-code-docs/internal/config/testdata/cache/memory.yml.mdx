title: "memory.yml"
---

## High-level description
This YAML configuration file defines settings for a memory-based cache system. It specifies cache properties such as enabling the cache, setting the backend type to memory, defining a time-to-live (TTL) for cached items, and configuring the eviction interval for the memory cache.

## Symbols

### `cache`
#### Description
The root configuration object for the cache system.

#### Internal Logic
The `cache` object contains several key-value pairs that define the behavior and settings of the cache system:

1. `enabled`: A boolean flag to enable or disable the cache.
2. `backend`: Specifies the type of cache backend to use, in this case, "memory".
3. `ttl`: Defines the time-to-live for cached items.
4. `memory`: A nested object containing memory-specific cache configurations.

### `cache.memory`
#### Description
A nested configuration object specific to the memory cache backend.

#### Internal Logic
The `memory` object contains a single key-value pair:

1. `eviction_interval`: Specifies the interval at which the cache should perform eviction of expired items.

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Value | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------|:------------|
| cache.enabled | boolean | true | Enables the cache system |
| cache.backend | string | "memory" | Specifies the cache backend type as memory |
| cache.ttl | duration | 5m | Sets the time-to-live for cached items to 5 minutes |
| cache.memory.eviction_interval | duration | 10m | Sets the eviction interval for the memory cache to 10 minutes |

This configuration file is likely used as test data for the cache system, specifically for the memory backend. It provides a sample configuration that can be used to test the parsing and application of cache settings in the larger application or framework.
