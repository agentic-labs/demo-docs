## High-level description
This directory contains YAML configuration files for tracing settings in a software system. The files define various tracing configurations, including OpenTelemetry (OTLP), Zipkin, and some intentionally incorrect configurations for testing purposes.

## What does it do?
These configuration files are used to set up and control the tracing functionality in the application. Tracing helps developers monitor and debug distributed systems by tracking requests as they flow through different services. The configurations define:

1. Whether tracing is enabled or disabled
2. Which tracing exporter to use (e.g., OTLP or Zipkin)
3. Sampling ratio to control how many traces are collected
4. Endpoints for sending trace data
5. Custom headers for authentication
6. Propagators for distributed tracing

Some files also contain intentionally incorrect configurations, likely used for testing the system's error handling and validation capabilities.

## Key Files

1. `otlp.yml`: Configures OpenTelemetry (OTLP) tracing with custom parameters.
   - Enables tracing
   - Sets OTLP as the exporter
   - Defines sampling ratio
   - Specifies OTLP endpoint and custom headers

2. `zipkin.yml`: Sets up Zipkin tracing configuration.
   - Enables tracing
   - Specifies Zipkin as the exporter
   - Defines the Zipkin API endpoint for sending trace data

3. `wrong_propagator.yml`: Contains an invalid propagator configuration for testing purposes.
   - Enables tracing
   - Specifies an invalid propagator name

4. `wrong_sampling_ratio.yml`: Includes an incorrect sampling ratio value for testing error handling.
   - Enables tracing
   - Sets an invalid sampling ratio (1.1, which is outside the valid range of 0 to 1)

## Configuration
The configuration files use a consistent YAML structure with the following main options:

1. `tracing.enabled`: A boolean flag to enable or disable tracing (default: true in most files)
2. `tracing.exporter`: Specifies the tracing exporter (e.g., "otlp" or "zipkin")
3. `tracing.sampling_ratio`: Sets the sampling ratio for traces (should be between 0 and 1)
4. `tracing.otlp.endpoint`: Defines the OTLP exporter endpoint (e.g., "http://localhost:9999")
5. `tracing.otlp.headers`: Custom headers for OTLP requests (e.g., API key)
6. `tracing.zipkin.endpoint`: Specifies the Zipkin API endpoint for sending trace data
7. `tracing.propagators`: List of propagators for distributed tracing (used in the wrong_propagator.yml file)

Example configuration from `otlp.yml`:

```yaml
tracing:
  enabled: true
  exporter: "otlp"
  sampling_ratio: 0.5
  otlp:
    endpoint: "http://localhost:9999"
    headers:
      api-key: "test-key"
```

These configuration files are likely used in conjunction with the `TracingConfig` and related structs defined in the `internal/config/tracing.go` file. The application would read these YAML files to initialize and configure the tracing subsystem with the specified parameters.

The presence of intentionally incorrect configurations (wrong_propagator.yml and wrong_sampling_ratio.yml) suggests that this directory is part of a test suite for the tracing system's configuration parsing and validation. Developers should ensure that the application correctly handles these invalid configurations by raising appropriate errors or warnings.
