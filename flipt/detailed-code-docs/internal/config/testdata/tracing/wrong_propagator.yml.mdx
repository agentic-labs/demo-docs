title: "wrong_propagator.yml"
---

## High-level description
This YAML configuration file is used to set up tracing options, specifically enabling tracing and defining propagators. However, it contains an invalid propagator configuration, which is likely used for testing purposes to ensure proper error handling or validation in the tracing system.

## Symbols

### `tracing`
#### Description
The `tracing` key is the root configuration object for tracing-related settings.

#### Internal Logic
The `tracing` object contains two sub-keys: `enabled` and `propagators`.

1. `enabled`: A boolean value set to `true`, indicating that tracing is enabled.
2. `propagators`: A list containing a single invalid propagator name.

### `enabled`
#### Description
A boolean flag indicating whether tracing is enabled or disabled.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| enabled | boolean | Determines if tracing is turned on or off |

### `propagators`
#### Description
A list of propagators to be used for distributed tracing. In this case, it contains an invalid propagator name.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| propagators | list of strings | Names of propagators to be used |

## Error Handling
This configuration file is intentionally set up with an invalid propagator name ("wrong_propagator"). This is likely used to test error handling or validation in the system that processes this configuration. The system should detect that "wrong_propagator" is not a valid propagator and respond appropriately, such as by raising an error or logging a warning.

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| tracing.enabled | boolean | true | Enables or disables tracing |
| tracing.propagators | list of strings | ["wrong_propagator"] | Specifies the propagators to be used (invalid in this case) |

## TODOs
While there are no explicit TODOs in the code, the presence of an invalid propagator suggests that this file is intended for testing purposes. Developers working with this configuration should be aware that it's not meant for production use and is likely part of a test suite for the tracing system's configuration parsing and validation.
