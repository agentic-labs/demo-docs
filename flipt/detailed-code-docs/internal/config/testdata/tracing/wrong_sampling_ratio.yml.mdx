title: "wrong_sampling_ratio.yml"
---

## High-level description
This YAML configuration file is used to define tracing settings for an application. It specifies whether tracing is enabled and sets an incorrect sampling ratio value, which is likely intended for testing purposes.

## Symbols

### `tracing`
#### Description
The `tracing` key is the main configuration block for tracing-related settings in the application.

#### Internal Logic
The `tracing` block contains two sub-keys:
1. `enabled`: A boolean value that determines whether tracing is turned on or off.
2. `sampling_ratio`: A numeric value that represents the sampling ratio for tracing.

### `enabled`
#### Description
This boolean flag indicates whether tracing is enabled for the application.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| enabled | boolean | When set to `true`, tracing is enabled; when `false`, tracing is disabled. |

### `sampling_ratio`
#### Description
This value represents the sampling ratio for tracing, determining what portion of requests or operations should be traced.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| sampling_ratio | float | A numeric value representing the sampling ratio. |

## Error Handling
The file intentionally contains an incorrect value for `sampling_ratio`. The value `1.1` is likely outside the expected range for a sampling ratio, which typically should be between 0 and 1 inclusive. This configuration is probably used in test scenarios to verify that the application correctly handles invalid sampling ratio values.

## TODOs
While there are no explicit TODOs in the code, the presence of an incorrect sampling ratio suggests that this file is intended for testing error handling or validation in the application's configuration parsing logic. Developers should ensure that the application appropriately detects and reports this invalid configuration.
