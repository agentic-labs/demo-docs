## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for the authentication configuration in the Flipt project. It tests the functionality of forward prefix handling and the requirement of a database for different authentication methods.

## Symbols

### TestWithForwardPrefix
#### Description
This function tests the `WithForwardPrefix` and `getForwardPrefix` functions to ensure they correctly set and retrieve the forward prefix from the context.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| t | *testing.T | Testing object for running the test and making assertions |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a background context
2. Asserts that the initial context has no forward prefix
3. Sets a forward prefix on the context
4. Asserts that the set forward prefix can be retrieved correctly

### TestRequiresDatabase
#### Description
This function tests the `RequiresDatabase` method of the `AuthenticationConfig` struct for various authentication methods.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| t | *testing.T | Testing object for running the test and making assertions |

#### Internal Logic
1. Defines a slice of test cases, each with a name, a function to enable a specific authentication method, and an expected result
2. Iterates through each test case:
   - Creates a new `AuthenticationConfig`
   - Enables the specified authentication method
   - Asserts that `RequiresDatabase()` returns the expected result
   - Checks the enabled methods and asserts that only one method is enabled
   - Asserts that the enabled method's name matches the test case name

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| context | For working with context in the forward prefix test |
| fmt | For printing enabled methods (used for debugging) |
| testing | For running the unit tests |
| github.com/stretchr/testify/assert | For making test assertions |

This test file ensures that the authentication configuration behaves correctly for different authentication methods and that the forward prefix functionality works as expected. It's an important part of maintaining the integrity of the authentication system in the Flipt project.
