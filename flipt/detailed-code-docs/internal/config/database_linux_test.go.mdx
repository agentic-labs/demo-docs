## High-level description
This code defines a unit test for the `defaultDatabaseRoot` function on Linux systems. It verifies that the default database root directory is correctly set to "/var/opt/flipt" for Linux environments.

## Symbols

### TestDefaultDatabaseRoot
#### Description
This function is a unit test that checks the behavior of the `defaultDatabaseRoot` function on Linux systems.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| t | *testing.T | The testing object provided by Go's testing framework |

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls the `defaultDatabaseRoot` function to get the root directory.
2. Asserts that no error is returned using `require.NoError`.
3. Verifies that the returned root directory is equal to "/var/opt/flipt" using `assert.Equal`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| testing | Go's built-in testing framework |
| github.com/stretchr/testify/assert | Provides additional assertion functions for testing |
| github.com/stretchr/testify/require | Provides additional requirement functions for testing |

## Configuration
This test file is specifically configured to run only on Linux systems using build tags:
```go
//go:build linux
// +build linux
```
These build tags ensure that this test is compiled and executed only on Linux platforms.

## References
The test relies on the `defaultDatabaseRoot` function, which is not defined in this file. It's likely defined in another file within the `config` package.
