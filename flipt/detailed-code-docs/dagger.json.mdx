## High-level description
This file, named `dagger.json`, is a configuration file for the Dagger CI/CD tool. It defines the project settings and build parameters for a project called "flipt", specifying the SDK, exclusions, source directory, engine version, and view patterns.

## Symbols

### Root Object
#### Description
The root object in this JSON file contains the main configuration settings for the Dagger project.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| name | string | The name of the project |
| sdk | string | The SDK used for the project |
| exclude | array of strings | Paths to be excluded from the build |
| source | string | The source directory for the build |
| engineVersion | string | The version of the Dagger engine to use |
| views | array of objects | Defines view configurations for the project |

#### Internal Logic
The configuration sets up a Dagger project named "flipt" using the Go SDK. It excludes specific directories from the build process, sets the source directory to "build", and specifies the Dagger engine version to use. It also defines a default view with specific inclusion/exclusion patterns.

### views
#### Description
An array containing view configurations for the project.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| name | string | The name of the view |
| patterns | array of strings | Inclusion/exclusion patterns for the view |

#### Internal Logic
The configuration defines a single view named "default" with patterns to exclude the ".git" directory and any "node_modules" directories from the view.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Dagger | CI/CD tool for which this configuration file is intended |

### Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| name | string | "flipt" | The name of the project |
| sdk | string | "go" | The SDK used for the project |
| exclude | array of strings | [".git", "bin", "ui/node_modules"] | Paths to be excluded from the build |

| engineVersion | string | "v0.12.3" | The version of the Dagger engine to use |

This configuration file sets up a Dagger project with specific settings for building and managing the "flipt" project. It uses the Go SDK, excludes certain directories from the build process, sets the source directory, and specifies the Dagger engine version. The file also defines a default view that excludes the ".git" directory and any "node_modules" directories from the view.
