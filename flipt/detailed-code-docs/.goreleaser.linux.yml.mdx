title: ".goreleaser.linux.yml"
---

## High-level description
This YAML file (.goreleaser.linux.yml) is a configuration file for GoReleaser, a tool used to automate the building, releasing, and distributing of Go projects. It specifically defines the build and release process for the Flipt project on Linux platforms.

## Code Structure
The file is structured into several main sections: project configuration, build settings, and archive settings. These sections define how the Flipt binary should be built and packaged for Linux distributions.

## Symbols

### `project_name`
#### Description
Specifies the name of the project as "flipt".

### `git`
#### Description
Configures Git-related settings for the release process.

#### Internal Logic
- `tag_sort`: Uses semantic versioning for sorting tags.

### `monorepo`
#### Description
Configures settings for monorepo projects.

#### Internal Logic
- `tag_prefix`: Sets the prefix for tags to "v".

### `builds`
#### Description
Defines the build configuration for the Flipt binary.

#### Internal Logic
- Specifies the main package location.
- Sets various ldflags for version information and analytics.
- Configures build for Linux on amd64 and arm64 architectures.
- Sets build flags and overrides for specific architectures.

### `archives`
#### Description
Configures the archiving process for the built binary.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets the format to "binary", meaning the output will be a single executable file without additional packaging.

## Dependencies
The file indirectly references external tools and libraries:
- GoReleaser (implied by the file's purpose)
- Go compiler and toolchain (implied by the nature of the project)

## Configuration
The file defines several build-time configuration options through ldflags:
- `version`: Set to the prefixed Git tag
- `commit`: Set to the Git commit hash
- `date`: Set to the build date
- `analyticsKey`: Set from an environment variable
- `analyticsEndpoint`: Set from an environment variable

## Performance Considerations
- The build process uses the `-trimpath` flag, which can help reduce binary size and improve reproducibility.
- CGO is enabled for both amd64 and arm64 builds, which may impact cross-compilation and binary portability.

This configuration file is crucial for creating consistent, versioned releases of the Flipt project for Linux platforms, ensuring that each build includes necessary version information and is optimized for the target architectures.
