title: "config.go"
---

## High-level description
This code defines the configuration management functionality for the Flipt application. It provides commands to initialize and edit Flipt configuration files, utilizing the Cobra command-line interface library and the Survey library for interactive prompts.

## Code Structure
The code defines two main command structures: `initCommand` and `editCommand`, which are used to create and modify Flipt configuration files, respectively. These commands are then added to a parent `config` command, which is created by the `newConfigCommand` function.

## Symbols

### `initCommand`
#### Description
This struct represents the command for initializing a new Flipt configuration file.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| force | bool | Flag to overwrite existing configuration file without prompting |

#### Internal Logic
1. Determines the default configuration file path.
2. If not in force mode, prompts the user for the file path and checks for file existence.
3. Creates the directory for the configuration file if it doesn't exist.
4. Generates a default configuration using `config.Default()`.
5. Marshals the configuration to YAML format.
6. Writes the configuration to the specified file.

### `editCommand`
#### Description
This struct represents the command for editing an existing Flipt configuration file.

#### Internal Logic
1. Reads the existing configuration file.
2. Opens the configuration in an editor for the user to modify.
3. Writes the modified configuration back to the file.

### `newConfigCommand`
#### Description
This function creates and returns the main `config` command, which includes the `init` and `edit` subcommands.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| cmd | *cobra.Command | The constructed config command with subcommands |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates the main `config` command.
2. Creates instances of `initCommand` and `editCommand`.
3. Defines the `init` and `edit` subcommands with their respective run functions.
4. Adds flags and subcommands to the main `config` command.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| github.com/AlecAivazis/survey/v2 | Used for interactive command-line prompts |
| github.com/spf13/cobra | Provides the command-line interface framework |
| go.flipt.io/flipt/internal/cmd/util | Contains utility functions for the command-line interface |
| go.flipt.io/flipt/internal/config | Provides configuration-related functionality |
| gopkg.in/yaml.v2 | Used for YAML marshaling and unmarshaling |

## Configuration
The code interacts with Flipt configuration files, which are expected to be in YAML format. It uses the `config.Default()` function to generate a default configuration when initializing a new file.

## Error Handling
The code uses error returning and checking throughout to handle various error conditions, such as file I/O errors or user input errors.

## TODOs
There is a TODO comment in the `editCommand.run` method to check if there is no TTY available.

This code provides a robust command-line interface for managing Flipt configuration files, allowing users to easily initialize new configurations and edit existing ones interactively.
