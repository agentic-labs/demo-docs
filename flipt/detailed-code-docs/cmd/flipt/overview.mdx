## High-level description
This directory contains the main command-line interface (CLI) implementation for the Flipt feature flag management system. It includes various commands for managing Flipt, such as server operations, configuration management, data import/export, flag evaluation, and validation.

## What does it do?
The Flipt CLI provides a comprehensive set of tools for interacting with and managing a Flipt instance. It allows users to:

1. Start and manage the Flipt server
2. Initialize and edit Flipt configurations
3. Import and export Flipt data
4. Evaluate feature flags
5. Validate flag state files
6. Generate shell completion scripts
7. Interact with Flipt Cloud services
8. Manage Flipt bundles (build, list, push, pull)

These functionalities enable developers and system administrators to efficiently manage feature flags, perform evaluations, and handle Flipt-related operations through a command-line interface.

## Entry points
The main entry point for the Flipt CLI is in the `main.go` file. This file sets up the root command and its subcommands using the Cobra library. The `exec()` function in `main.go` initializes the CLI structure and handles the execution of commands.

Key entry points for specific functionalities include:

- `server.go`: Implements the core Flipt server functionality
- `evaluate.go`: Handles flag evaluation commands
- `import.go` and `export.go`: Manage data import and export operations
- `validate.go`: Implements flag state file validation
- `cloud.go`: Provides Flipt Cloud-related commands
- `bundle.go`: Manages Flipt bundle operations

The control flow typically starts from the main function, which calls `exec()`. The `exec()` function sets up the command structure and executes the appropriate subcommand based on user input.

## Key Files
1. `main.go`: The main entry point and CLI setup
2. `server.go`: Core server implementation
3. `config.go`: Configuration management commands
4. `evaluate.go`: Flag evaluation functionality
5. `import.go` and `export.go`: Data import and export commands
6. `validate.go`: Flag state validation
7. `cloud.go`: Flipt Cloud interaction
8. `bundle.go`: Bundle management commands

## Dependencies
The Flipt CLI relies on several key dependencies:

1. `github.com/spf13/cobra`: Used for building the CLI structure and command handling
2. `go.uber.org/zap`: Provides logging functionality
3. `go.flipt.io/flipt/internal/*`: Various internal packages for Flipt functionality
4. `go.flipt.io/flipt/sdk/go`: Flipt SDK for Go
5. `github.com/AlecAivazis/survey/v2`: Used for interactive prompts in some commands
6. OpenTelemetry packages: For tracing and metrics (when enabled)

## Configuration
The Flipt CLI uses a configuration file (typically `default.yml`) to manage various settings. The configuration includes options for:

- Server address and ports
- Database connection details
- Authentication settings
- Logging configuration
- Feature toggles (e.g., tracing, metrics)

The `config.go` file provides commands to initialize and edit this configuration. The default configuration file location varies by platform:

- Linux: `/etc/flipt/config/default.yml`
- Other platforms: Defined in `default.go`

Users can specify a custom configuration file using command-line flags or environment variables.

The CLI also supports various command-specific flags and options, allowing users to customize behavior for individual operations.

In summary, the `cmd/flipt` directory implements a feature-rich CLI for Flipt, providing a wide range of tools for managing and interacting with Flipt instances. It serves as the primary interface for users to control and configure Flipt through the command line.
