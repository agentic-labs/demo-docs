## High-level description
This file is part of the `flipt` command-line tool and defines a platform-specific variable for the default configuration file location. It is specifically designed for non-Linux operating systems, as indicated by the build constraints.

### `defaultConfigFile`
#### Description
`defaultConfigFile` is a package-level variable of type `string`. It is intended to store the default path or name of the configuration file for the Flipt application on non-Linux platforms.

#### Inputs
This variable does not have inputs as it is a package-level variable.

#### Outputs
This variable does not have outputs as it is a package-level variable.

## Dependencies
This file does not explicitly import or use any external libraries or modules.

## Configuration
The `defaultConfigFile` variable is likely to be set to a platform-specific value during the build process or at runtime. The actual value is not defined in this file.

## Build Constraints
This file uses Go build constraints to ensure that it is only compiled for non-Linux platforms:

1. `//go:build !linux`: This is the new-style build constraint introduced in Go 1.17. It indicates that this file should be excluded from the build when compiling for Linux.
2. `// +build !linux`: This is the old-style build constraint, included for compatibility with older Go versions. It serves the same purpose as the new-style constraint.

These constraints ensure that the `defaultConfigFile` variable defined in this file is only used when building the Flipt command-line tool for non-Linux operating systems. There is likely a corresponding file for Linux platforms that defines the `defaultConfigFile` variable with a Linux-specific value.
