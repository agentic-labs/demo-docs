title: "banner.go"

## High-level description
This file defines a banner template and a structure for populating the banner with build and version information for the Flipt application. The banner is likely displayed when the application starts or when version information is requested.

## Symbols

### `bannerTmpl`
#### Description
`bannerTmpl` is a constant string that defines the ASCII art banner and the template for displaying version and build information for the Flipt application.

#### Internal Logic
The template uses Go's text/template syntax to insert dynamic values:
- Version (if available)
- Commit hash
- Build date
- Go version
- Operating system and architecture

### `bannerOpts`
#### Description
`bannerOpts` is a struct that holds the information needed to populate the banner template.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Version | string | The version of the Flipt application |
| Commit | string | The Git commit hash of the build |
| Date | string | The build date of the application |
| GoVersion | string | The version of Go used to compile the application |
| GoOS | string | The operating system for which the application was built |
| GoArch | string | The architecture for which the application was built |

## Dependencies
This file does not have any external dependencies beyond the standard Go libraries.

## Configuration
This file does not define any configuration options. The `bannerOpts` struct is likely populated elsewhere in the application with the appropriate build-time information.

## Notes
1. The ASCII art in the banner spells out "Flipt", which is presumably the name of the application.
2. The Version field in the banner is conditionally displayed, suggesting that it might be optional or not always available.
3. This file is part of the `main` package, indicating it's likely used in the entry point of the application.
4. The banner template and struct are designed to provide a consistent way to display version and build information across different builds and environments of the Flipt application.
