## High-level description
This code defines a `GRPCServer` struct and associated functions for configuring and running a gRPC server for the Flipt application. It sets up various components such as storage, caching, authentication, authorization, metrics, tracing, and audit logging based on the provided configuration.

## Code Structure
The main symbol is the `GRPCServer` struct, which encapsulates the gRPC server and its dependencies. The `NewGRPCServer` function is responsible for initializing all the components and setting up the server. The `Run` method starts the server, and the `Shutdown` method gracefully stops it.

## Symbols

### `GRPCServer` struct
#### Description
Represents the gRPC server for Flipt, including its dependencies and configuration.

#### Internal Logic
- Holds the gRPC server instance, logger, configuration, and network listener
- Maintains a list of shutdown functions to be called during server shutdown

### `NewGRPCServer` function
#### Description
Constructs and configures the Flipt gRPC server with all its dependencies.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ctx | context.Context | Context for the server initialization |
| logger | *zap.Logger | Logger instance |
| cfg | *config.Config | Flipt configuration |
| info | info.Flipt | Flipt version information |
| forceMigrate | bool | Flag to force database migrations |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| *GRPCServer | *GRPCServer | Configured gRPC server instance |
| error | error | Error if any occurred during initialization |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up network listener
2. Configures storage based on configuration (database or file system)
3. Initializes metrics exporter if enabled
4. Sets up tracing provider and exporter if enabled
5. Configures authentication and authorization interceptors
6. Sets up audit logging if enabled
7. Initializes and registers various gRPC services (Flipt, metadata, evaluation, etc.)
8. Configures gRPC server options and interceptors
9. Registers health check and reflection services

### `Run` method
#### Description
Starts the gRPC server and begins serving requests.

#### Internal Logic
Calls the `Serve` method on the underlying gRPC server with the configured listener.

### `Shutdown` method
#### Description
Gracefully shuts down the gRPC server and its dependencies.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ctx | context.Context | Context for the shutdown operation |

#### Internal Logic
Executes all registered shutdown functions in reverse order.

## Dependencies
The code relies on various external libraries and internal packages:
- gRPC and related middleware packages
- Zap for logging
- OpenTelemetry for tracing and metrics
- Internal Flipt packages for storage, caching, authentication, authorization, and more

## Error Handling
The code uses extensive error checking and propagation throughout the initialization process. Errors are wrapped with additional context using `fmt.Errorf` to provide more informative error messages.

## Logging
Zap logger is used throughout the code for logging at various levels (Debug, Info, Error). The logger is configured based on the provided configuration.

## Performance Considerations
- The server uses connection pooling for database connections
- Caching is implemented to improve performance when enabled
- Tracing and metrics are optional and can be enabled/disabled based on configuration

This code provides a flexible and extensible foundation for the Flipt gRPC server, allowing for easy configuration and management of various components and features.
