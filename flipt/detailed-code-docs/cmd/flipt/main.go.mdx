## High-level description
This file contains the main entry point for the Flipt application, a feature flag management system. It sets up the configuration, initializes various components like logging, telemetry, and servers, and manages the application lifecycle.

## Code Structure
The main function calls `exec()`, which sets up the command-line interface using Cobra. The primary functionality is implemented in the `run()` function, which initializes and runs the core components of the application.

## Symbols

### `main()`
#### Description
The entry point of the application. It calls `exec()` and exits with status code 1 if an error occurs.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls `exec()`
2. If an error is returned, exits with status code 1

### `exec()`
#### Description
Sets up the command-line interface and executes the root command.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates the root Cobra command and its subcommands
2. Sets up signal handling for graceful shutdown
3. Executes the root command

### `run(ctx context.Context, logger *zap.Logger, cfg *config.Config)`
#### Description
The main function that runs the Flipt application. It initializes and starts various components like telemetry, gRPC server, HTTP server, and cloud tunnel (if enabled).

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ctx | context.Context | The context for managing the application lifecycle |
| logger | *zap.Logger | The logger instance for the application |
| cfg | *config.Config | The configuration for the application |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks for updates if enabled
2. Initializes telemetry if enabled
3. Starts the gRPC server
4. Starts the HTTP server
5. Starts the cloud tunnel if enabled
6. Waits for shutdown signal and performs graceful shutdown

### `buildConfig(ctx context.Context)`
#### Description
Builds the configuration for the application by loading and parsing the configuration file.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ctx | context.Context | The context for the configuration building process |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| logger | *zap.Logger | The configured logger instance |
| cfg | *config.Config | The parsed configuration |
| error | error | Any error that occurred during the process |

#### Internal Logic
1. Determines the configuration file to use
2. Loads and parses the configuration
3. Sets up the logger based on the configuration
4. Returns the logger and parsed configuration

## Dependencies
- Various standard library packages (e.g., `context`, `os`, `time`)
- Third-party libraries (e.g., `github.com/spf13/cobra`, `go.uber.org/zap`)
- Internal packages from the Flipt project

## Configuration
The application uses a configuration file and environment variables for setup. The configuration includes settings for logging, server, database, authentication, and various other components.

## Error Handling
The application uses error returning and logging for error handling. Errors are propagated up to the main function, which exits with a non-zero status code if an error occurs.

## Logging
The application uses the `zap` logging library for structured logging. The log level and output can be configured through the application's configuration.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code.
