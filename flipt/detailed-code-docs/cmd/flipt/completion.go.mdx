## High-level description
This code defines a function `newCompletionCommand()` that creates a Cobra command for generating shell completion scripts. The command supports generating completion scripts for bash, zsh, fish, and powershell shells.

## Symbols

### `newCompletionCommand()`
#### Description
This function creates and returns a new Cobra command for generating shell completion scripts. The command is hidden from the main help output and expects exactly one argument specifying the shell type.

#### Inputs
This function takes no inputs.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| return value | *cobra.Command | A pointer to a new Cobra command for generating shell completion scripts |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a new `cobra.Command` with the following properties:
   - Use: "completion [SHELL]"
   - Short description: "Generate completion scripts"
   - Args: Expects exactly one argument and only valid arguments
   - Hidden: Set to true, hiding the command from the main help output
2. Defines a `RunE` function that executes when the command is run:
   - Uses a switch statement to determine which shell completion script to generate based on the provided argument
   - Calls the appropriate generation method on the root command (e.g., `GenBashCompletion`, `GenZshCompletion`, etc.)
   - Outputs the generated script to stdout or the specified output
3. Returns the created command

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| github.com/spf13/cobra | Provides the Command structure and functionality for creating CLI commands |

## Error Handling
The command uses `cobra.MatchAll(cobra.ExactArgs(1), cobra.OnlyValidArgs)` for argument validation, ensuring that exactly one valid argument is provided. If an invalid or no argument is provided, Cobra will handle the error and display an appropriate error message.

## Notes
- The command is hidden (`Hidden: true`), which means it won't appear in the main help output of the CLI application.
- The function ignores any errors returned by the completion script generation methods (`_ = cmd.Root().Gen...`). This might lead to silent failures if there are issues generating the scripts.
- The command supports four shell types: bash, zsh, fish, and powershell.
