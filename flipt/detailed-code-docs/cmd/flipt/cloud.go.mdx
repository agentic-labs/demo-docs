## High-level description
This code implements a command-line interface for interacting with Flipt Cloud, specifically handling authentication. It provides functionality for logging in and out of Flipt Cloud, using a browser-based authentication flow.

## Code Structure
The main structure is the `cloudCommand` struct, which contains methods for handling cloud-related operations. The code defines several commands (`login` and `logout`) as part of a larger CLI structure using the Cobra library.

## Symbols

### `newCloudCommand`
#### Description
This function creates and returns a new Cobra command for interacting with Flipt Cloud. It sets up the main "cloud" command and its subcommands (login and logout).

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| return | *cobra.Command | The configured Cobra command for cloud operations |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a new `cloudCommand` struct
2. Sets up the main "cloud" command
3. Adds a persistent flag for the Flipt Cloud URL
4. Creates and adds "login" and "logout" subcommands

### `cloudCommand.login`
#### Description
This method handles the login process for Flipt Cloud. It checks if the cloud feature is enabled, prompts the user for confirmation, and initiates the login flow.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| cmd | *cobra.Command | The Cobra command being executed |
| args | []string | Command-line arguments (not used) |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| error | error | Any error encountered during the login process |

#### Internal Logic
1. Builds the configuration and checks if the cloud feature is enabled
2. Parses and validates the cloud URL
3. Prompts the user for confirmation to open the browser
4. Initiates the login flow if confirmed
5. Prints a success message upon successful authentication

### `cloudCommand.loginFlow`
#### Description
This method handles the actual login flow, including starting a local server, opening the browser for authentication, and storing the received token.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ctx | context.Context | The context for the operation |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| error | error | Any error encountered during the login flow |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes the authentication flow
2. Starts a local server to handle the callback
3. Generates and opens a browser URL for authentication
4. Waits for the authentication token
5. Stores the received token in a local file

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
