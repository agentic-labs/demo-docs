title: "doc.go"

## High-level description
This code defines a hidden command `doc` for generating Markdown documentation for the Flipt CLI. It uses the Cobra library to create a command that generates documentation for all commands in the CLI, saving the output to a specified directory.

## Symbols

### `newDocCommand`
#### Description
This function creates and returns a new `cobra.Command` for generating documentation. The command is hidden from normal CLI usage and is designed to create Markdown files for all commands in the Flipt CLI.

#### Inputs
This function takes no inputs.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| return value | *cobra.Command | A pointer to a new Cobra command for documentation generation |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a new `cobra.Command` with the following properties:
   - Use: "doc [path]"
   - Short: "Generate command documentation"
   - Hidden: true
2. Defines a `RunE` function that executes when the command is run:
   - Sets a default path "./tmp/docs" or uses the provided argument
   - Creates the directory for documentation if it doesn't exist
   - Generates Markdown documentation for all commands using `doc.GenMarkdownTree`
   - Prints a success message with the documentation path

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| fmt | For formatted printing and error handling |
| os | For directory creation |
| github.com/spf13/cobra | For creating and managing CLI commands |
| github.com/spf13/cobra/doc | For generating Markdown documentation |

## Error Handling
The command uses error wrapping to provide context for any errors that occur during execution. It handles two main error cases:
1. Failure to create the documentation directory
2. Failure to generate the documentation

Both errors are wrapped with additional context before being returned.

## Side Effects
- Creates a directory at the specified path (default: "./tmp/docs")
- Generates Markdown files in the specified directory

## Performance Considerations
This command is not performance-critical as it's typically run infrequently for documentation purposes. However, it may take longer to execute for CLIs with many commands or subcommands.
