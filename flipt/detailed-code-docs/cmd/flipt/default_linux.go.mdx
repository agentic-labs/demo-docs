title: "default_linux.go"

## High-level description
This file defines the default configuration file path for the Flipt application on Linux systems. It is a platform-specific implementation that sets the default configuration file location to "/etc/flipt/config/default.yml".

## Symbols

### `defaultConfigFile`
#### Description
`defaultConfigFile` is a variable that specifies the default path for the Flipt configuration file on Linux systems.

#### Inputs
This variable does not have any inputs as it is a constant declaration.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| defaultConfigFile | string | The default path to the Flipt configuration file on Linux systems |

## Build Tags
The file uses Go build tags to ensure that this code is only compiled and used on Linux systems.

1. `//go:build linux`: This is the new-style build constraint introduced in Go 1.17. It specifies that this file should only be built when compiling for Linux.

2. `// +build linux`: This is the old-style build constraint. It serves the same purpose as the new-style constraint and is included for compatibility with older Go versions.

These build tags ensure that this default configuration path is only used when Flipt is compiled and run on Linux systems. Other operating systems would likely have their own platform-specific files with different default paths.

## Dependencies
This file does not import any external packages or have any dependencies.

## Configuration
The file sets a default configuration path, which is likely used by the main Flipt application to locate its configuration file if no other path is specified. The default path follows common Linux conventions for application configuration:

- `/etc/`: Standard directory for system-wide configuration files
- `flipt/`: Application-specific directory
- `config/`: Subdirectory for configuration files
- `default.yml`: The default configuration file in YAML format

This structure allows for easy management of Flipt's configuration in a Linux environment, following standard practices for system administration and application deployment.
