title: "docker-compose.yml"
---

## High-level description
This `docker-compose.yml` file defines a multi-container Docker application with two services: a server and a UI. It sets up the development environment for a web application, allowing developers to run both the backend server and frontend UI concurrently in separate containers.

## Code Structure
The file defines two main services (`server` and `ui`) and a volume (`exclude`). The services are configured with specific build contexts, working directories, port mappings, volume mounts, and startup commands.

## Symbols

### `version`
#### Description
Specifies the version of the Docker Compose file format being used.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| version | string | The version number of the Docker Compose file format |

### `services`
#### Description
Defines the services that make up the application.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| server | object | Configuration for the server service |
| ui | object | Configuration for the UI service |

### `server`
#### Description
Configures the backend server service.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| build | object | Specifies how to build the Docker image for this service |
| working_dir | string | Sets the working directory inside the container |
| ports | array | Maps container ports to host ports |
| volumes | array | Mounts host directories or named volumes to the container |
| command | array | Specifies the command to run when the container starts |

### `ui`
#### Description
Configures the frontend UI service.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| depends_on | array | Specifies that this service depends on the server service |
| build | string | Specifies the build context for the UI service |
| working_dir | string | Sets the working directory inside the container |
| ports | array | Maps container ports to host ports |
| volumes | array | Mounts host directories or named volumes to the container |
| command | array | Specifies the command to run when the container starts |

### `volumes`
#### Description
Defines named volumes used by the services.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| exclude | object | An empty object representing a named volume |

## Dependencies
This Docker Compose configuration implicitly depends on Docker and Docker Compose being installed on the system where it will be run.

## Configuration
The configuration is primarily defined through the service definitions. Key configuration options include:

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| build.context | string | . | The build context for the server service |
| build.dockerfile | string | ./Dockerfile.dev | The Dockerfile to use for building the server service |
| ports | array | - | Port mappings for each service |
| volumes | array | - | Volume mounts for each service |
| command | array | - | Startup command for each service |

## Performance Considerations
The use of volume mounts (`volumes` configuration) allows for real-time code changes without rebuilding containers, which is beneficial for development but may have a slight performance impact compared to copied files.

## TODOs
- Consider adding environment variable configurations for both services if needed.
- Evaluate if health checks should be added to ensure services are fully operational.
- Review if any additional services (e.g., database) need to be added to the composition.
