## High-level description
This YAML file contains configuration data for a feature flag system. It defines a namespace, flags, variants, rules, rollouts, and segments, which are commonly used in feature flag management and A/B testing scenarios.

## Code Structure
The YAML file is structured hierarchically, with the main sections being `namespace`, `flags`, and `segments`. Each section contains nested elements that define various aspects of the feature flag system.

## Symbols

### namespace
#### Description
Defines the top-level namespace for the configuration.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| key | string | Unique identifier for the namespace |
| name | string | Human-readable name for the namespace |
| description | string | Brief description of the namespace |

### flags
#### Description
An array of feature flags defined in the system.

#### Inputs
Each flag in the array has the following structure:
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| key | string | Unique identifier for the flag |
| name | string | Human-readable name for the flag |
| description | string | Brief description of the flag (optional) |
| enabled | boolean | Whether the flag is enabled or not |
| variants | array | List of variants for the flag (optional) |
| rules | array | List of rules for flag evaluation (optional) |
| rollouts | array | List of rollout configurations (optional) |

### segments
#### Description
An array of user segments defined for targeting specific groups of users.

#### Inputs
Each segment in the array has the following structure:
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| key | string | Unique identifier for the segment |
| name | string | Human-readable name for the segment |
| description | string | Brief description of the segment |
| match_type | string | Type of matching to be used for the segment |
| constraints | array | List of constraints for segment evaluation (optional) |

## Internal Logic

### Flags
The file defines two flags:

1. "flipt" flag:
   - Has multiple variants, including some with attachments
   - Contains rules for different user segments
   - Uses percentage-based rollouts

2. "boolean" flag:
   - Uses a combination of segment-based and percentage-based rollouts

### Segments
Two segments are defined:

1. "all-users": A segment that includes all users
2. "internal-users": A segment for internal users, with a constraint based on the organization property

The `match_type` for both segments is set to `ALL_MATCH_TYPE`, indicating that all conditions must be met for a user to be included in the segment.

## Dependencies
This YAML file doesn't directly depend on external libraries or modules. However, it is likely used as input for a feature flag management system that interprets and applies these configurations.

## Configuration
The entire file serves as a configuration for a feature flag system. It defines various options for namespaces, flags, segments, and their associated rules and rollouts.

## Error Handling
As this is a YAML configuration file, there is no explicit error handling. However, the system that consumes this file should validate its structure and content to ensure all required fields are present and correctly formatted.

## API/Interface Reference
While this file doesn't define an API directly, it represents a data structure that could be consumed by an API. The structure of the YAML file implies the following main entities:

1. Namespace
2. Flags
3. Variants
4. Rules
5. Rollouts
6. Segments
7. Constraints

These entities and their relationships form the core of the feature flag system's data model.
