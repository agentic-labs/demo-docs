## High-level description
This YAML file represents a configuration for feature flags and user segments in a feature flag management system. It defines a single feature flag with variants and rules, as well as two user segments with their respective matching criteria.

## Code Structure
The YAML file is structured into four main sections: version, namespace, flags, and segments. These sections define the configuration version, default namespace, feature flags, and user segments respectively.

## Symbols

### version
#### Description
Specifies the version of the configuration format.

#### Value
"1.0"

### namespace
#### Description
Defines the default namespace for the configuration.

#### Value
"default"

### flags
#### Description
An array containing feature flag definitions.

#### Internal Logic
The file defines one feature flag named "flipt" with two variants and two rules.

### segments
#### Description
An array containing user segment definitions.

#### Internal Logic
The file defines two segments: "all-users" and "internal-users", each with their own matching criteria.

## Configuration
The YAML file defines the following configuration:

### Feature Flag: flipt
| Option | Value | Description |
|:-------|:------|:------------|
| key | flipt | Unique identifier for the flag |
| name | flipt | Display name for the flag |
| description | flipt | Description of the flag |
| enabled | false | Flag is currently disabled |

#### Variants
1. key: flipt, name: flipt
2. key: flipt, name: flipt

#### Rules
1. Segment: internal-users
   - Distribution: variant: fromFlipt, rollout: 100%
2. Segment: all-users
   - Distribution: variant: fromFlipt2, rollout: 100%

### Segments
1. All Users (key: all-users)
   - Description: All Users
   - Match Type: ALL_MATCH_TYPE

2. Internal Users (key: internal-users)
   - Description: All internal users at flipt.
   - Match Type: ALL_MATCH_TYPE
   - Constraint:
     - Type: STRING_COMPARISON_TYPE
     - Property: organization
     - Operator: eq
     - Value: flipt

This configuration file sets up a feature flag system with one flag and two user segments. The flag has two variants and rules that determine how it should be applied to different user segments. The segments are defined with specific matching criteria to categorize users.
