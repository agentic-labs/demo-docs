title: "invalid_yaml_stream.yaml"
---

## High-level description
This YAML file contains test data for an invalid YAML stream. It defines two namespaces with flags, segments, and rules, but includes an intentional error in the second namespace to test validation mechanisms.

## Code Structure
The file is structured as a YAML stream with two documents separated by `---`. Each document represents a different namespace configuration for a feature flag system.

## Symbols

### First Namespace (default)
#### Description
Defines a configuration for the "default" namespace with flags, segments, and rules.

#### Internal Logic
- Defines a flag named "flipt" with two variants and two rules.
- Specifies two segments: "all-users" and "internal-users".
- The "internal-users" segment includes a constraint based on organization.

### Second Namespace (foo)
#### Description
Defines a configuration for the "foo" namespace, similar to the first but with an intentional error.

#### Internal Logic
- Mirrors the structure of the first namespace.
- Contains an invalid rollout percentage (110%) in the second rule's distribution.

## Error Handling
The file is intentionally designed to contain an error (invalid rollout percentage) to test validation mechanisms in the system processing this YAML.

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| namespace | string | N/A | Defines the namespace for the configuration |
| flags | array | N/A | List of feature flags |
| segments | array | N/A | List of user segments |

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the file, but the invalid rollout percentage (110%) in the second namespace is likely intentional for testing purposes.
