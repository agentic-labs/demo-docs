## High-level description
This directory contains test data files for validating the core functionality of a feature flag management system. The files include various YAML configurations that represent different scenarios and edge cases for feature flags, segments, and namespaces.

## What does it do?
The testdata directory provides a set of YAML files that simulate different configurations for a feature flag system. These files are used to test the validation and parsing mechanisms of the system. They include:

1. Valid configurations with different versions and features
2. Invalid configurations to test error handling
3. YAML streams with multiple namespaces
4. Configurations with metadata and advanced features

These files help ensure that the system can correctly handle various input scenarios, including both valid and invalid configurations, across different versions of the configuration format.

## Key Files

1. `invalid.yaml`: Contains intentionally invalid configurations to test error handling and validation.
2. `invalid_yaml_stream.yaml`: A YAML stream with multiple namespaces, including an invalid configuration.
3. `valid.yaml`: A basic valid configuration for feature flags and segments.
4. `valid_default_variant_v3.yaml`: Demonstrates the use of default variants in version 3 of the configuration format.
5. `valid_metadata_v3.yaml`: Showcases the use of metadata in feature flags for version 3.
6. `valid_namespace_details_v4.yaml`: Illustrates namespace details in version 4 of the configuration format.
7. `valid_segments_v2.yaml`: Focuses on segment configurations in version 2.
8. `valid_v1.yaml`: A valid configuration using version 1 of the format.
9. `valid_yaml_stream.yaml`: A YAML stream with multiple valid namespace configurations.

These files cover a range of scenarios and features, allowing thorough testing of the system's ability to parse, validate, and handle different configuration structures and versions.

## Configuration
The test data files use various versions of the configuration format, ranging from 1.0 to 1.4. Key configuration elements include:

1. Namespaces: Organize flags and segments
2. Flags: Define feature flags with variants, rules, and rollouts
3. Segments: Specify user groups with constraints
4. Metadata: Additional information for flags (in newer versions)
5. Rollouts: Gradual feature release configurations

The files demonstrate different combinations of these elements to cover various use cases and ensure the system can handle complex configurations.
