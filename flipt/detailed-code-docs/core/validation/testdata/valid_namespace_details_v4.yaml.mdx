title: "valid_namespace_details_v4.yaml"
---

## High-level description
This YAML file contains test data for validating namespace details in version 1.4 of a feature flag management system. It defines two namespaces with their respective flags, segments, and configurations, showcasing various features and structures used in feature flag management.

## Code Structure
The file is structured into two main sections, each representing a different namespace. Each namespace contains definitions for flags and segments, with flags having properties such as variants, rules, and metadata.

## Symbols

### Namespace: default
#### Description
Defines the default namespace with its flags and segments.

#### Internal Logic
- Contains one flag named "flipt" with two variants and two rules
- Defines two segments: "all-users" and "internal-users"

### Namespace: foo
#### Description
Defines a namespace named "foo" with its flags and segments.

#### Internal Logic
- Contains two flags: "flipt" and "boolean"
- The "flipt" flag has two variants and two rules
- The "boolean" flag has two rollouts
- Defines two segments: "all-users" and "internal-users"

### Flag: flipt (in default namespace)
#### Description
Defines a feature flag named "flipt" with variants and rules.

#### Internal Logic
- Has two variants, both named "flipt"
- Contains two rules associated with different segments
- Includes metadata with various properties

### Flag: flipt (in foo namespace)
#### Description
Defines a feature flag named "flipt" in the "foo" namespace.

#### Internal Logic
- Similar to the "flipt" flag in the default namespace
- One variant includes a description

### Flag: boolean (in foo namespace)
#### Description
Defines a boolean feature flag named "Boolean" with rollouts.

#### Internal Logic
- Has two rollouts: one for internal users and one with a 50% threshold

### Segment: all-users
#### Description
Defines a segment that includes all users.

#### Internal Logic
- Uses ALL_MATCH_TYPE for matching

### Segment: internal-users
#### Description
Defines a segment for internal users at flipt.

#### Internal Logic
- Uses ALL_MATCH_TYPE for matching
- Includes a constraint to match users with organization "flipt"

## Configuration
The file uses version 1.4 of the configuration schema, as specified in the `version` field at the beginning of the file.

## Notes
This YAML file serves as test data for validating namespace details, flags, segments, and their various properties in a feature flag management system. It demonstrates different configurations and structures that can be used in such a system, including variants, rules, distributions, rollouts, and constraints.
