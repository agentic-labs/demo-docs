## High-level description
This file contains integration tests for the Flipt feature flag management system. It tests various configurations and storage backends, including SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL, CockroachDB, Redis, Git, S3, OCI, Azure Blob Storage, and Google Cloud Storage. The tests cover API functionality, caching, authentication, authorization, and audit logging.

## Code Structure
The file defines a set of test cases that can be run individually or as a suite. Each test case sets up a specific configuration for Flipt and runs a set of tests against it. The main `Integration` function orchestrates the execution of these test cases.

## Symbols

### `Integration`
#### Description
This function is the entry point for running integration tests. It sets up the test environment, filters the test cases to run, and executes them concurrently.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ctx | context.Context | The context for the test run |
| client | *dagger.Client | A Dagger client for container orchestration |
| base | *dagger.Container | A base container for running tests |
| flipt | *dagger.Container | A container with the Flipt binary |
| opts | ...IntegrationOptions | Optional configuration for the test run |

#### Internal Logic
1. Filters the test cases based on the provided options
2. Sets up logging if enabled
3. Configures authentication for the Flipt instance
4. Runs each test case concurrently
5. Exports logs if enabled

### Test Case Functions
The file defines several test case functions, each testing a specific aspect of Flipt:

- `api`: Tests basic API functionality
- `snapshot`: Tests snapshot functionality
- `ofrep`: Tests on-the-fly replication
- `cache`: Tests caching functionality
- `cacheWithTLS`: Tests caching with TLS
- `local`: Tests local file storage
- `git`: Tests Git storage backend
- `s3`: Tests S3 storage backend
- `oci`: Tests OCI storage backend
- `importExport`: Tests import and export functionality
- `authn`: Tests authentication
- `authz`: Tests authorization
- `withWebhook`: Tests webhook audit logging
- `withWebhookTemplates`: Tests webhook audit logging with custom templates

Each of these functions sets up a specific Flipt configuration and runs a suite of tests against it.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| dagger | Container orchestration for tests |
| github.com/stretchr/testify | Assertion library for tests |
| github.com/google/uuid | Generating unique identifiers |
| gopkg.in/yaml.v3 | YAML parsing and generation |

## Error Handling
The code uses Go's standard error handling mechanisms. Errors are propagated up the call stack and handled in the main `Integration` function.

## Performance Considerations
The tests are designed to run concurrently to improve overall execution time. A semaphore is used to limit the number of concurrent tests based on the number of CPU cores available.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code.
