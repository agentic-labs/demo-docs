## High-level description
The `core/validation` directory contains code and resources for validating feature flag configurations in the Flipt system. It includes a JSON schema definition, test data, validation logic, and associated tests. The main components are a schema validator, test cases, and fuzz testing for robustness.

## What does it do?
This directory provides functionality to:

1. Define the structure and rules for feature flag configurations using a JSON schema.
2. Validate YAML and JSON configuration files against this schema.
3. Handle various file systems and configuration versions.
4. Test the validation logic with a range of valid and invalid configurations.
5. Perform fuzz testing to identify potential issues with unexpected inputs.

The validation process ensures that feature flag configurations adhere to the expected structure, including flags, segments, rollouts, rules, variants, and constraints. It supports different versions of the configuration format and can work with various storage backends.

## Key Files

1. `flipt.json`: Defines the JSON schema for feature flag configurations. It outlines the structure for flags, segments, rollouts, rules, variants, and constraints.

2. `validate.go`: Contains the core validation logic, including the `FeaturesValidator` struct and methods for validating configurations against the CUE schema. It supports validating single documents and entire file systems.

3. `validate_test.go`: Includes integration tests for various Flipt configurations and storage backends. It tests API functionality, caching, authentication, authorization, and audit logging.

4. `validate_fuzz_test.go`: Implements fuzz testing for the `Validate` function to identify potential panics or unexpected behavior with random inputs.

5. `testdata/`: A directory containing various YAML files used for testing different configuration scenarios, including valid and invalid configurations across multiple versions.

## Dependencies
The validation package relies on several external libraries:

1. `cuelang.org/go/cue`: Used for CUE schema validation.
2. `github.com/go-git/go-billy/v5`: Provides file system abstraction.
3. `github.com/gobwas/glob`: Used for glob pattern matching in file selection.
4. `github.com/stretchr/testify`: Assertion library for tests.
5. `github.com/google/uuid`: Generates unique identifiers for tests.
6. `gopkg.in/yaml.v3`: Handles YAML parsing and generation.

## Configuration
The validation process can be configured using a `.flipt.yml` file, which specifies include and exclude patterns for file selection. If this file is not present, default patterns are used. The JSON schema in `flipt.json` serves as the main configuration definition, specifying the structure and validation rules for feature flag configurations.

The validation supports multiple versions of the configuration format, ranging from 1.0 to 1.4, allowing for backward compatibility and future extensibility.

In summary, the `core/validation` directory provides a robust system for defining, validating, and testing feature flag configurations in the Flipt system. It ensures that configurations adhere to the expected structure and rules, supporting various storage backends and file systems while maintaining flexibility for future changes.
