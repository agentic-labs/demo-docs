## High-level description
This code defines a fuzz test for the `Validate` function in the `validation` package. It uses Go's built-in fuzzing framework to test the `NewFeaturesValidator` and `Validate` functions with various input data, focusing on detecting panics during validation.

## Code Structure
The main function `FuzzValidate` is defined as a fuzz test. It initializes test cases from YAML files and uses them as seed inputs for the fuzzer. The fuzzer then generates new inputs based on these seeds to test the validation functions.

## Symbols

### `FuzzValidate`
#### Description
This function is the entry point for the fuzz test. It sets up initial test cases and defines the fuzzing logic.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| f | *testing.F | Fuzzing object provided by Go's testing framework |

#### Internal Logic
1. Defines a list of test case files.
2. Reads each test case file and adds its content as seed input to the fuzzer.
3. Defines the fuzzing function that:
   - Creates a new `FeaturesValidator` with the fuzzed input as a schema extension.
   - Attempts to validate the fuzzed input.
   - Skips the test if there are non-panic errors.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| bytes | Used to create a new buffer for input data |
| os | Used to read test case files |
| testing | Provides the fuzzing framework |

## Error Handling
The code uses `t.Skip()` to ignore non-panic errors during validation. This allows the fuzzer to focus on finding inputs that cause panics rather than expected validation errors.

## Performance Considerations
The test is designed to run repeatedly with different inputs, so it's important to keep the operations within the fuzz function relatively lightweight to allow for many iterations.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code.

Note: This fuzz test is specifically built for Go version 1.18 and later, as indicated by the build constraint at the top of the file.
