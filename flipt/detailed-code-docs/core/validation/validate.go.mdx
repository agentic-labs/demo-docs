## High-level description
This code defines a package called `validation` which provides functionality for validating Flipt feature flag configuration files. It includes a `FeaturesValidator` struct and associated methods for validating YAML and JSON files against a CUE schema definition. The package also includes utility functions for handling errors and working with file systems.

## Code Structure
The main components of this code are:

1. `FeaturesValidator`: The core struct for validating feature flag configurations.
2. Error handling types and functions: `Error`, `Unwrap`, `Location`.
3. File system related functions: `ValidateFilesFromBillyFS`, `ValidateFilesFromFS`.
4. Index file handling: `fliptIndex`, `fliptIndexSource`, and related functions.

These components work together to provide a comprehensive validation system for Flipt feature flag configurations.

## Symbols

### `FeaturesValidator`
#### Description
A struct that encapsulates the validation logic for Flipt feature flag configurations.

#### Internal Logic
- Uses CUE (Cue Language) for schema validation
- Supports schema extensions through options
- Validates single documents and entire file systems

### `Validate`
#### Description
Validates a YAML file against the CUE definition of features.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| file | string | The name of the file being validated |
| reader | io.Reader | The reader containing the file contents |

#### Internal Logic
- Decodes YAML documents
- Validates each document against the CUE schema
- Handles multi-document YAML files

### `ValidateFilesFromBillyFS`
#### Description
Validates files from a Billy file system implementation.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| src | billy.Filesystem | The source file system |

#### Internal Logic
- Reads the `.flipt.yml` index file if present
- Walks the file system and validates relevant files

### `ValidateFilesFromFS`
#### Description
Validates files from a standard `fs.FS` implementation.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| src | fs.FS | The source file system |

#### Internal Logic
- Similar to `ValidateFilesFromBillyFS`, but uses `fs.FS` interface

### `fliptIndex`
#### Description
Represents a set of glob include and exclude patterns for filtering paths.

#### Internal Logic
- Uses glob patterns to match file paths
- Supports both include and exclude patterns

### `newFliptIndex`
#### Description
Creates a new `fliptIndex` instance from a `fliptIndexSource`.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| index | fliptIndexSource | The source index configuration |

#### Internal Logic
- Compiles glob patterns for includes and excludes

## Error Handling
The package defines custom error types and handling mechanisms:
- `Error` struct for representing validation errors with file and line information
- `Unwrap` function for handling nested errors

## Dependencies
- `cuelang.org/go/cue`: For CUE schema validation
- `github.com/go-git/go-billy/v5`: For file system abstraction
- `github.com/gobwas/glob`: For glob pattern matching

## Configuration
The package uses a `.flipt.yml` file for configuring which files to include/exclude in validation. If not present, it uses default patterns.

This package provides a robust system for validating Flipt feature flag configurations, supporting multiple file systems and flexible file matching patterns.
