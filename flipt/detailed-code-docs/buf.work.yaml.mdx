## High-level description

This `buf.work.yaml` file is a configuration file for the Buf tool, which is used for managing Protocol Buffers (protobuf) in a project. It specifies the version of the Buf configuration and defines the directories that Buf should work with.

## Symbols

### `version`
#### Description
Specifies the version of the Buf configuration format being used.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| version | string | The version identifier for the Buf configuration |

### `directories`

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Buf | Protocol Buffer management tool |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| version | string | N/A | Specifies the version of the Buf configuration (v1 in this case) |
| directories | array of strings | N/A | Specifies the directories Buf should process (rpc/flipt in this case) |

This configuration file is minimal and straightforward. It tells Buf to work with the Protocol Buffer files located in the `rpc/flipt` directory. This setup is typically used in projects that utilize Protocol Buffers for defining service interfaces or data structures, particularly in the context of gRPC (gRPC Remote Procedure Call) systems.
