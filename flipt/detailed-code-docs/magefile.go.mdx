## High-level description
This `magefile.go` file defines a set of tasks for building, testing, and managing the Flipt project using the Mage build tool. It includes tasks for Go and UI development, as well as various utility functions for project management.

## Code Structure
The file defines several namespaces (Go, UI, Dagger) and standalone functions that represent different tasks and utilities. These tasks are interconnected and can depend on each other, forming a comprehensive build and development workflow for the Flipt project.

## Symbols

### Default
#### Description
The `Default` variable is set to the `Build` function, making it the default task when running Mage without specifying a task.

### Bootstrap
#### Description
Installs tools required for development by creating a `_tools` directory and installing specified Go packages.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a `_tools` directory
2. Initializes a Go module in `_tools` if it doesn't exist
3. Installs specified Go tools using `go install`

### Build
#### Description
Builds the project similar to a release build, including preparing the project and building the Go binary.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls `Prep` as a dependency
2. Builds the project using `build` function with `buildModeProd` mode
3. Prints instructions for running Flipt

### Clean
#### Description
Cleans up built files and directories, including running `go mod tidy`.

### Prep
#### Description
Prepares the project for building by cleaning and building the UI.

### build
#### Description
Internal function to build the Go binary with specified build mode and flags.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mode | buildMode | Specifies the build mode (dev or prod) |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets build date and git commit
2. Constructs build arguments based on the mode
3. Executes `go build` command with constructed arguments

### Go Namespace
#### Description
Contains various Go-related tasks such as running, testing, benchmarking, and linting.

### UI Namespace
#### Description
Contains tasks related to the UI, including installing dependencies, running in development mode, and building for production.

### Dagger Namespace
#### Description
Contains a single method for calling Dagger commands.

### findFilesRecursive
#### Description
Utility function to recursively find files matching a given criteria.

## Dependencies
The file uses several external libraries:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| github.com/fatih/color | For colored console output |
| github.com/magefile/mage/mg | For Mage task management |
| github.com/magefile/mage/sh | For shell command execution |

## TODOs
- Remove custom marshaller for Flipt API v2 to use the default v2 marshaller directly (in related file `rpc/flipt/marshaller.go`)

This magefile provides a comprehensive set of tasks for managing the Flipt project, covering both Go and UI development aspects, as well as various utility functions for project management and build processes.
