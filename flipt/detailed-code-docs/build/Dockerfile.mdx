title: "Dockerfile"
---

## High-level description
This Dockerfile defines a multi-stage build process for creating a Docker image containing the Flipt application. The resulting image is based on Alpine Linux and includes the Flipt binary, configuration files, and necessary dependencies.

## References
This Dockerfile references the following code symbols:
- `BINARY`: An argument specifying the name of the Flipt binary file.

## Symbols
### `BINARY`
#### Description
This argument defines the name of the Flipt binary file that will be copied into the Docker image. It defaults to "flipt".

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| alpine:3.20.2 | Base image for the Docker image, providing a minimal Linux environment. |
| postgresql-client | Allows the Flipt application to connect to and interact with PostgreSQL databases. |
| openssl | Provides Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) functionality, essential for secure communication. |
| ca-certificates | Contains root certificates for verifying the authenticity of SSL/TLS connections. |

## Configuration
This Dockerfile does not define any specific configuration options. However, it copies configuration files from the `config/*.yml` path to `/etc/flipt/config/` within the Docker image.

## Error Handling
This Dockerfile does not implement specific error handling beyond the standard behavior of the `RUN` and `COPY` instructions.

## Logging
This Dockerfile does not implement specific logging mechanisms. Logging behavior would be determined by the Flipt application itself.

## API/Interface Reference
This Dockerfile does not expose an API or public interface. It defines the build process for a Docker image.
