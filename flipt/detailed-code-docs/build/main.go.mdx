## High-level description
The `build/main.go` file defines Dagger functions for building, packaging, and testing the Flipt application. It leverages the Dagger Go SDK to define a series of functions that encapsulate the build, test, and packaging logic for Flipt.

## Code Structure
The code defines two main structs: `Flipt` and `Test`. The `Flipt` struct contains methods for building the base Flipt container (`Base`) and the final packaged container (`Build`). The `Test` struct contains methods for running various test suites against a built Flipt container, such as UI, unit, CLI, migration, load, and integration tests.

## References
- `internal` package: Provides functions for building the base container, UI container, and packaging the final Flipt container.
- `testing` package: Provides functions for running various test suites against a built Flipt container.

## Symbols

### `Flipt`
#### Description
The `Flipt` struct represents the Flipt application within the Dagger build context. It holds references to the source code directory, the base container, and the UI container.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
The `Flipt` struct doesn't have any complex internal logic. It mainly serves as a holder for Dagger resources related to the Flipt build process.

### `Flipt.Base`
#### Description
This function builds a Dagger container containing all the compiled assets of Flipt, ready for testing and distribution.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ctx | context.Context | The context for the function call. |
| source | *dagger.Directory | The Dagger directory representing the Flipt source code. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| *dagger.Container | A pointer to the Dagger container with the compiled Flipt assets. |
| error | error | An error object if something went wrong during the build process. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the default platform for the Dagger client.
2. Builds the UI container using the `internal.UI` function.
3. Builds the base container using the `internal.Base` function, providing the UI container's `dist` directory and the parsed platform.

### `Flipt.Build`
#### Description
This function builds a Dagger container containing the Flipt binaries packaged in a minimal Alpine Linux distribution.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ctx | context.Context | The context for the function call. |
| source | *dagger.Directory | The Dagger directory representing the Flipt source code. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| *dagger.Container | A pointer to the Dagger container with the packaged Flipt binaries. |
| error | error | An error object if something went wrong during the build process. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls the `Flipt.Base` function to build the base container.
2. Uses the `internal.Package` function to package the Flipt binaries from the base container into a new Alpine Linux container.

### `Test`
#### Description
The `Test` struct represents a Flipt testing context within Dagger. It holds references to the source code directory, the base container, the UI container, and the final Flipt container.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
The `Test` struct doesn't have any complex internal logic. It mainly serves as a holder for Dagger resources related to the Flipt testing process.

### `Flipt.Test`
#### Description
This function initializes a `Test` struct by building the Flipt container and returning it along with the source, base, and UI containers.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ctx | context.Context | The context for the function call. |
| source | *dagger.Directory | The Dagger directory representing the Flipt source code. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| *Test | A pointer to the initialized `Test` struct. |
| error | error | An error object if something went wrong during the build process. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls the `Flipt.Build` function to build the Flipt container.
2. Returns a new `Test` struct initialized with the source, base, UI, and Flipt containers.

### `Test.UI`, `Test.Unit`, `Test.CLI`, `Test.Migration`, `Test.Load`, `Test.Integration`
#### Description
These functions execute specific test suites against the built Flipt container.

#### Inputs
- `ctx`: The context for the function call.
- `cases` (Integration only): A space-separated string of test cases to run. Defaults to "*", which runs all cases.
- `exportLogs` (Integration only): A boolean flag indicating whether to export logs from the test run. Defaults to false.

#### Outputs
- `*dagger.File` (Unit only): A pointer to the Dagger file containing the unit test results.
- `error`: An error object if any of the test suites fail.

#### Internal Logic
These functions utilize the `testing` package to execute the corresponding test suites. They pass the necessary Dagger resources, such as containers and directories, to the testing functions.

## Dependencies
- `github.com/containerd/containerd/platforms`: Used for platform parsing and formatting.
- `go.flipt.io/build/internal`: Provides internal build functions.
- `go.flipt.io/build/testing`: Provides testing functions.

## Error Handling
The code uses the standard Go error handling mechanism. Most functions return an `error` object as the last return value, which will be non-nil if an error occurred during the function execution.
