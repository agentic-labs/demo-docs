## High-level description
This code implements a load testing tool for the Flipt feature flag system. It uses the Vegeta HTTP load testing library to send requests to a Flipt server and measure its performance under various conditions.

## Code Structure
The main function sets up three different types of load tests (flag, variant, and boolean) using Vegeta targeters. Each targeter generates HTTP requests to different Flipt API endpoints. The `attack` function executes these load tests and reports the results.

## Symbols

### `main`
#### Description
The main function of the load testing tool. It parses command-line flags, sets up the load test parameters, and executes the load tests for different Flipt API endpoints.

#### Internal Logic
1. Parse command-line flags for test configuration.
2. Define three Vegeta targeters for different Flipt API endpoints:
   - `flagTargeter`: Requests flag information
   - `variantTargeter`: Evaluates variant flags
   - `booleanTargeter`: Evaluates boolean flags
3. Call the `attack` function for each targeter to execute the load tests.

### `attack`
#### Description
Executes a Vegeta load test for a given targeter and reports the results.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| name | string | Name of the load test |
| t | vegeta.Targeter | Vegeta targeter function |

#### Internal Logic
1. Create a new Vegeta attacker.
2. Execute the attack for the specified duration and rate.
3. Collect metrics from the attack.
4. Print detailed results, including latency statistics, throughput, and error rates.

### `Evaluation`
#### Description
A struct representing the payload for flag evaluation requests.

#### Fields
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| EntityId | string | Unique identifier for the entity being evaluated |
| FlagKey | string | Key of the flag being evaluated |
| Context | map[string]string | Additional context for the evaluation |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| github.com/gofrs/uuid | Generating unique IDs for evaluation requests |
| github.com/tsenart/vegeta/lib | HTTP load testing library |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| duration | time.Duration | 60 seconds | Duration of the load test |
| rate | int | 100 | Number of requests per second |
| flipt-addr | string | "http://flipt:8080" | Address of the Flipt server |
| flipt-auth-token | string | "" | Authentication token for Flipt |
| flipt-cache-enabled | bool | false | Whether Flipt caching is enabled |

## Performance Considerations
The load test is designed to measure the performance of a Flipt server under different loads and configurations. It reports various metrics such as mean latency, percentiles, throughput, and error rates, which can be used to analyze the server's performance characteristics.
