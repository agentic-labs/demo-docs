## High-level description
The `Migration` function in `build/testing/migration.go` is designed to test the migration process of Flipt, a feature flag management system. It sets up a test environment, imports test data into the latest Flipt version, runs a migration with a new Flipt build, and then verifies that the new build continues to work as expected.

## Code Structure
The `Migration` function is the main symbol in this file. It uses the `dagger.Client` and two `dagger.Container` objects (`base` and `flipt`) to set up and run the migration test. The function interacts with GitHub API to get the latest Flipt release and uses various Docker containers to perform the migration and testing steps.

## Symbols

### `Migration`
#### Description
This function performs a migration test for Flipt. It sets up a test environment, imports test data, runs a migration, and verifies the new build's functionality.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ctx | context.Context | The context for the operation |
| client | *dagger.Client | Dagger client for container operations |
| base | *dagger.Container | Base container for testing |
| flipt | *dagger.Container | Container with the new Flipt build |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| error | error | Any error encountered during the migration process |

#### Internal Logic
1. Set up a cache volume for Flipt state.
2. Create a container with the latest Flipt version and import test data.
3. Fetch the latest Flipt release from GitHub.
4. Clone the last release and use its readonly test suite.
5. Import test data into the latest Flipt instance for two namespaces.
6. Run migration with the new Flipt build.
7. Verify that the new Flipt build works as expected by running tests.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| github.com/google/go-github/v53/github | Interacting with GitHub API |
| github.com/google/uuid | Generating unique identifiers |
| go.flipt.io/build/internal/dagger | Container and build operations |

## Error Handling
The function returns an error if any step in the migration process fails. It uses error wrapping to provide context for the errors.

Your response should not exceed 3000 words or 4000 tokens. Focus on providing clear, concise information that can be directly inferred from the code. Include optional sections only when they provide significant value for understanding the code.
