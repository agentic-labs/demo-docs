## High-level description
This code defines a function `CLI` that performs a series of tests on the Flipt CLI tool. It uses the Dagger framework to set up and execute various CLI commands in containerized environments, verifying the expected outputs and behaviors.

## Code Structure
The `CLI` function contains multiple test cases, each enclosed in a separate block. These test cases cover different aspects of the Flipt CLI, including help output, version information, configuration handling, import/export functionality, and bundle operations. The function uses helper functions like `assertExec`, `flipt`, and `sh` to execute commands and assert their outputs.

## Symbols

### CLI
#### Description
The main function that runs a series of tests on the Flipt CLI tool using containerized environments.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ctx | context.Context | The context for the operation |
| client | *dagger.Client | The Dagger client for container operations |
| source | *dagger.Directory | The source directory containing test files |
| container | *dagger.Container | The base container for running tests |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| error | error | Any error encountered during the tests |

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes various Flipt CLI commands in different scenarios
2. Verifies the output and behavior of each command
3. Tests include help output, version info, configuration handling, import/export, and bundle operations
4. Uses helper functions to assert expected outputs and behaviors

## Side Effects
- Creates and modifies files within the test containers
- Interacts with external services (e.g., MinIO for S3 testing)

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| context | For context management |
| fmt | For string formatting |
| strings | For string manipulation |
| time | For time-related operations |
| github.com/containerd/containerd/platforms | For platform-specific operations |
| go.flipt.io/build/internal/dagger | For container operations |

## Error Handling
The function returns an error if any of the test cases fail. Each test case uses `assertExec` to verify the expected output and behavior of CLI commands.

## Performance Considerations
The function includes a sleep operation (`time.Sleep(time.Second)`) to ensure timestamp changes between bundle builds. This may impact the overall execution time of the tests.

## TODOs
There is a TODO comment indicating that tests for Flipt cloud commands need to be added:
```go
{
    // TODO: add tests for flipt cloud commands
}
```

This code provides comprehensive testing for the Flipt CLI, covering various aspects of its functionality and ensuring proper behavior across different scenarios and configurations.
