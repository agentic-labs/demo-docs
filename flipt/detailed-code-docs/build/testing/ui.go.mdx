title: "ui.go"

## High-level description
This code defines functions for building and testing the UI component of the Flipt project using Dagger, a CI/CD engine. It sets up a testing environment, installs Playwright, runs UI tests, and exports test reports.

## Code Structure
The code contains two main functions: `UI` and `buildUI`. The `UI` function orchestrates the UI testing process, while `buildUI` prepares the testing environment by setting up the UI and Flipt containers.

## Symbols

### `UI`
#### Description
This function sets up and runs UI tests using Playwright in a Dagger container.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ctx | context.Context | The context for the operation |
| client | *dagger.Client | The Dagger client |
| ui | *dagger.Container | The UI container |
| flipt | *dagger.Container | The Flipt container |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| error | error | Any error encountered during the process |

#### Internal Logic
1. Builds the UI testing environment using `buildUI`.
2. Installs Playwright and its dependencies.
3. Runs Playwright tests.
4. Exports the test report to a local directory.

### `buildUI`
#### Description
This function prepares the UI testing environment by setting up the UI and Flipt containers.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ctx | context.Context | The context for the operation |
| ui | *dagger.Container | The UI container |
| flipt | *dagger.Container | The Flipt container |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| *dagger.Container | *dagger.Container | The prepared UI container |
| error | error | Any error encountered during the process |

#### Internal Logic
1. Synchronizes the Flipt and UI containers.
2. Sets up the Flipt container as a service with specific environment variables.
3. Adds the Flipt binary to the UI container.
4. Sets the `FLIPT_ADDRESS` environment variable in the UI container.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| context | For handling context in asynchronous operations |
| os | For accessing environment variables |
| time | For generating unique timestamps |
| go.flipt.io/build/internal/dagger | For interacting with the Dagger CI/CD engine |

## Error Handling
The code uses Go's standard error handling mechanism. Errors are returned from functions and checked immediately after function calls.

## Performance Considerations
The code uses Dagger's container synchronization (`Sync` method) to ensure that container operations are completed before proceeding, which may impact performance for large containers or slow networks.

## Side Effects
- Installs Playwright and its dependencies in the container.
- Runs UI tests using Playwright.
- Exports test reports to a local directory named "playwright-report".

This code is part of a larger CI/CD pipeline for the Flipt project, focusing on UI testing. It leverages Dagger for containerized operations, ensuring consistent test environments across different platforms.
