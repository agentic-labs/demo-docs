## Dependencies
This configuration file relies on the existence of two other YAML files:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| default.yaml | Likely contains default configuration settings for Flipt |
| production.yaml | Probably contains production-specific configuration settings for Flipt |

## Configuration
The configuration structure is as follows:
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| version | string | "1.0" | Specifies the version of the Flipt configuration format |
| include | list of strings | ["default.yaml", "production.yaml"] | Lists additional configuration files to be included |

This configuration file serves as a main entry point for Flipt's configuration, bringing together multiple configuration files to create a complete setup. It allows for separation of concerns by potentially keeping default settings and production-specific settings in separate files while providing a single point of reference for the overall configuration.
