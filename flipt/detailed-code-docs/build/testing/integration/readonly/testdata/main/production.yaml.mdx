title: "production.yaml"
---

## High-level description
This YAML file defines a feature flag configuration for a production environment. It includes multiple flags, each with various rules and segments, allowing for granular control over feature rollouts and A/B testing scenarios.

## Code Structure
The file is structured into three main sections: namespace, flags, and segments. The flags section contains multiple feature flags, each with its own set of rules and variants. The segments section defines user segments that can be targeted by the flags.

## Symbols

### `namespace`
#### Description
Defines the namespace for the feature flags configuration.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| key | string | Identifier for the namespace |
| name | string | Human-readable name for the namespace |

### `flags`
#### Description
An array of feature flag configurations.

### `Flag`
#### Description
Represents a single feature flag configuration.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| key | string | Unique identifier for the flag |
| name | string | Human-readable name for the flag |
| type | string | Type of the flag (e.g., VARIANT_FLAG_TYPE, BOOLEAN_FLAG_TYPE) |
| description | string | Description of the flag's purpose |
| enabled | boolean | Whether the flag is currently active |
| variants | array | List of possible variants for the flag (for VARIANT_FLAG_TYPE) |
| rules | array | List of rules defining how the flag should be applied |
| rollouts | array | List of rollout configurations (for BOOLEAN_FLAG_TYPE) |

### `segments`
#### Description
An array of user segment definitions.

### `Segment`
#### Description
Defines a user segment that can be targeted by feature flags.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| key | string | Unique identifier for the segment |
| name | string | Human-readable name for the segment |
| description | string | Description of the segment's purpose |
| constraints | array | List of constraints defining the segment |
| match_type | string | Type of matching to use for constraints (e.g., ALL_MATCH_TYPE) |

## Internal Logic
The file defines 50 feature flags (flag_001 to flag_050) and 50 segments (segment_001 to segment_050). Each flag has rules that target specific segments and define distribution percentages for different variants. There are also special flags for boolean types, disabled flags, and flags using entity IDs.

The segments are defined with constraints that determine which users belong to each segment, typically based on a property called "in_segment".

This configuration allows for complex feature rollout strategies, A/B testing, and user segmentation for a production environment.
