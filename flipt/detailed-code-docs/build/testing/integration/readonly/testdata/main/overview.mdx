## High-level description
This directory contains configuration files for a feature flag management system, likely Flipt. It includes a main configuration file (.flipt.yml) and two additional YAML files (default.yaml and production.yaml) that define feature flags, segments, and rules for different environments.

## What does it do?
This directory sets up a comprehensive feature flagging system that allows developers to control the rollout of features to different user segments. It enables:

1. Defining multiple feature flags with various types (variant and boolean).
2. Creating user segments based on specific criteria.
3. Setting up rules for flag distribution among different segments.
4. Configuring separate settings for default and production environments.

This system allows for gradual feature rollouts, A/B testing, and targeted feature releases based on user characteristics or behaviors.

## Key Files

1. `.flipt.yml`: This is the main configuration file for Flipt. It specifies the configuration version and includes two additional YAML files:
   - `default.yaml`
   - `production.yaml`

2. `default.yaml`: This file defines a set of feature flags and segments, likely for a testing or staging environment. It includes:
   - A namespace definition
   - 50 feature flags (flag_001 to flag_050) with similar structures
   - Additional flags for specific purposes (e.g., boolean flags)
   - 50 segments with different distribution rules

3. `production.yaml`: This file contains feature flag configurations specifically for the production environment. It includes:
   - A namespace definition
   - 50 feature flags (flag_001 to flag_050)
   - 50 segments (segment_001 to segment_050)
   - Special flags for boolean types, disabled flags, and flags using entity IDs

Both `default.yaml` and `production.yaml` follow a similar structure but may have different configurations tailored to their respective environments.

## Configuration

The configuration is spread across three YAML files:

1. `.flipt.yml`:
   ```yaml
   version: "1.0"
   include:
     - default.yaml
     - production.yaml
   ```

2. `default.yaml` and `production.yaml`:
   These files share a similar structure:

   ```yaml
   namespace:
     key: default
     name: Default
     description: Default namespace

   flags:
     - key: flag_001
       name: Flag 1
       type: VARIANT_FLAG_TYPE
       description: Description for Flag 1
       enabled: true
       variants:
         - key: on
           name: On
         - key: off
           name: Off
       rules:
         - segment:
             key: segment_001
           distributions:
             - variant:
                 key: on
               percentage: 50
             - variant:
                 key: off
               percentage: 50

   segments:
     - key: segment_001
       name: Segment 1
       description: Description for Segment 1
       constraints:
         - property: in_segment
           operator: eq
           value: "true"
       match_type: ALL_MATCH_TYPE
   ```

   The files define multiple flags and segments with various rules and constraints. The production file may have more specific or refined configurations compared to the default file.

Key configuration elements:
- Namespace: Defines the scope for flags and segments
- Flags: Define features that can be toggled on/off or have multiple variants
- Segments: Define user groups based on specific criteria
- Rules: Determine how flags are applied to different segments
- Constraints: Define the criteria for segment membership

This configuration allows for fine-grained control over feature releases, enabling gradual rollouts, A/B testing, and targeted feature availability based on user segments.

## Dependencies
The main dependency for this configuration is the Flipt feature flag management system. The configuration files are designed to work with Flipt's expected format and functionality.

By structuring the configuration in this way, the system provides flexibility for managing feature flags across different environments (default and production) while maintaining a centralized configuration approach through the main `.flipt.yml` file.
