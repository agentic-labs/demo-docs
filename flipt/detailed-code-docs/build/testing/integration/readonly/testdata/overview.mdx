## High-level description
This directory contains configuration files for a feature flag management system, likely Flipt. It includes two subdirectories, "alternate" and "main", each containing YAML files that define feature flags, segments, and rules for different environments, specifically default and production configurations.

## What does it do?
This directory sets up a comprehensive feature flagging system that allows developers to control the rollout of features to different user segments across multiple environments. It enables:

1. Defining multiple feature flags with various types (variant and boolean).
2. Creating user segments based on specific criteria.
3. Setting up rules for flag distribution among different segments.
4. Configuring separate settings for default and production environments.
5. Providing an alternate configuration setup with simpler flag definitions.

This system allows for gradual feature rollouts, A/B testing, and targeted feature releases based on user characteristics or behaviors. The configuration can be easily adjusted for different environments, enabling developers to test features in a default environment before deploying them to production.

## Key Files

1. `alternate/.flipt.yml`, `alternate/default.yaml`, `alternate/production.yaml`:
   These files in the "alternate" subdirectory provide a simpler configuration setup, focusing on basic feature flag definitions for default and production environments.

2. `main/.flipt.yml`, `main/default.yaml`, `main/production.yaml`:
   These files in the "main" subdirectory offer a more comprehensive configuration, including detailed feature flags, segments, and distribution rules for both default and production environments.

## Configuration
The configuration is spread across multiple YAML files in two subdirectories:

1. Alternate Configuration:
   - `.flipt.yml`: Includes `default.yaml` and `production.yaml`
   - `default.yaml` and `production.yaml`: Define simple feature flags
     ```yaml
     version: "1.2"
     flags:
       - key: flag_variant
         name: Alternate Flag Type Variant
         type: VARIANT_FLAG_TYPE
         description: Variant Flag Description
         enabled: false
       - key: flag_boolean
         name: Alternate Flag Type Boolean
         type: BOOLEAN_FLAG_TYPE
         description: Boolean Flag Description
         enabled: true
     ```

2. Main Configuration:
   - `.flipt.yml`: Includes `default.yaml` and `production.yaml`
   - `default.yaml` and `production.yaml`: Define comprehensive feature flags, segments, and rules
     ```yaml
     namespace:
       key: default
       name: Default
       description: Default namespace

     flags:
       - key: flag_001
         name: Flag 1
         type: VARIANT_FLAG_TYPE
         description: Description for Flag 1
         enabled: true
         variants:
           - key: on
             name: On
           - key: off
             name: Off
         rules:
           - segment:
               key: segment_001
             distributions:
               - variant:
                   key: on
                 percentage: 50
               - variant:
                   key: off
                 percentage: 50

     segments:
       - key: segment_001
         name: Segment 1
         description: Description for Segment 1
         constraints:
           - property: in_segment
             operator: eq
             value: "true"
         match_type: ALL_MATCH_TYPE
     ```

The main configuration provides more detailed control over feature flags, including:
- Namespace definitions
- Multiple feature flags (up to 50 in each environment)
- User segments with specific criteria
- Distribution rules for flags among segments

This setup allows for fine-grained management of feature releases, enabling developers to test features in a default environment before rolling them out to production, and to target specific user segments with different feature variants.

## Dependencies
The main dependency for this configuration is the Flipt feature flag management system. The configuration files are designed to work with Flipt's expected format and functionality.

By providing both a simplified "alternate" configuration and a more comprehensive "main" configuration, this setup offers flexibility for different use cases and complexity levels in feature flag management.
