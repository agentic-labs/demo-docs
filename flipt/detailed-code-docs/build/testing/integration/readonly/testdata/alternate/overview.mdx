## High-level description
This directory contains configuration files for a feature flag management system, likely Flipt. It includes three YAML files that define feature flags and their settings for different environments, specifically a default configuration and a production configuration.

## What does it do?
This directory sets up feature flags for an application. Feature flags are a software development technique that allows developers to enable or disable certain features of an application without deploying new code. The configuration in this directory defines two types of feature flags:

1. A variant flag: This type of flag can have multiple options or "variants". It's currently disabled.
2. A boolean flag: This is a simple on/off flag. It's currently enabled.

These flags are defined for both a default environment (possibly for testing or development) and a production environment. The configuration allows developers to easily manage which features are active in different environments, enabling them to test new features, perform A/B testing, or quickly disable problematic features without needing to change the application code.

## Key Files

1. `.flipt.yml`:
   This is the main configuration file for Flipt. It specifies the configuration version and includes two other YAML files: `default.yaml` and `production.yaml`. This structure allows for modular configuration management, separating settings for different environments.

2. `default.yaml`:
   This file defines the feature flags for a default environment, likely used for testing or development. It includes configurations for both a variant flag and a boolean flag.

3. `production.yaml`:
   Similar to `default.yaml`, this file defines feature flags for the production environment. It uses the same structure but may have different settings appropriate for a live, customer-facing environment.

## Configuration
The configuration is spread across three YAML files:

1. `.flipt.yml`:
   ```yaml
   version: "1.0"
   include:
     - default.yaml
     - production.yaml
   ```
   This file specifies the configuration version and includes the other two YAML files.

2. `default.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   version: "1.2"
   flags:
     - key: flag_variant
       name: Alternate Flag Type Variant
       type: VARIANT_FLAG_TYPE
       description: Variant Flag Description
       enabled: false
     - key: flag_boolean
       name: Alternate Flag Type Boolean
       type: BOOLEAN_FLAG_TYPE
       description: Boolean Flag Description
       enabled: true
   ```
   This file defines two feature flags for a default environment:
   - A variant flag named "Alternate Flag Type Variant" which is disabled
   - A boolean flag named "Alternate Flag Type Boolean" which is enabled

3. `production.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   version: "1.2"
   namespace: production
   flags:
     - key: flag_variant
       name: Alternate Flag Type Variant
       type: VARIANT_FLAG_TYPE
       description: Variant Flag Description
       enabled: false
     - key: flag_boolean
       name: Alternate Flag Type Boolean
       type: BOOLEAN_FLAG_TYPE
       description: Boolean Flag Description
       enabled: true
   ```
   This file defines the same two feature flags for the production environment, with the same settings as the default environment. The addition of the `namespace: production` line indicates that these settings are specifically for the production environment.

The configuration allows for easy management of feature flags across different environments. Developers can quickly enable or disable features, or change their behavior, by modifying these YAML files. This setup provides flexibility in feature deployment and testing, allowing for gradual rollouts, A/B testing, and quick feature toggles without needing to modify or redeploy the main application code.
