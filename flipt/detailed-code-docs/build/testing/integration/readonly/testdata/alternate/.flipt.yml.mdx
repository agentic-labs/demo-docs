## High-level description
This YAML file, named `.flipt.yml`, is a configuration file for Flipt, a feature flag management system. It specifies the configuration version and includes additional YAML files to be used in the Flipt setup.

## Symbols

### `version`
#### Description
Specifies the version of the Flipt configuration format being used.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| version | string | The version number of the Flipt configuration format |

### `include`
#### Description
Lists additional YAML files to be included in the Flipt configuration.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| include | list of strings | File names of additional YAML configurations to be included |

## Dependencies
This configuration file relies on the existence of two other YAML files:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| default.yaml | Likely contains default configuration settings for Flipt |
| production.yaml | Probably contains production-specific configuration settings for Flipt |

## Configuration
The configuration in this file is minimal and primarily serves to include other configuration files:
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| version | string | "1.0" | Specifies the version of the Flipt configuration format |
| include | list of strings | ["default.yaml", "production.yaml"] | Lists additional YAML files to be included in the configuration |

This configuration file acts as a main entry point for Flipt's setup, bringing together default and production-specific configurations. The use of separate files for different environments (default and production) suggests a modular approach to configuration management, allowing for easier maintenance and environment-specific settings.
