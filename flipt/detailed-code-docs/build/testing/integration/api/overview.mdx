## High-level description

This directory contains integration tests for the Flipt feature flag management system's API. It includes comprehensive test suites that cover various aspects of Flipt's functionality, including API operations, authentication, authorization, and different storage backends. The tests are designed to ensure the robustness and correctness of Flipt's core features across different configurations and scenarios.

## What does it do?

The integration tests in this directory perform the following tasks:

1. Set up test environments with different configurations, including various database backends (SQLite, LibSQL, PostgreSQL, MySQL, CockroachDB), caching options, and storage backends (local filesystem, Git, S3, OCI, Azure Blob Storage).

2. Test core API functionalities such as managing namespaces, flags, variants, segments, constraints, rules, and distributions.

3. Verify authentication and authorization mechanisms.

4. Test evaluation and batch evaluation of feature flags.

5. Check import and export functionality.

6. Validate webhook functionality, including template support.

7. Test snapshot and OFREP (Object File REPresentation) features.

8. Ensure proper error handling and expected behavior across different scenarios.

These tests simulate real-world usage of the Flipt system, ensuring that all components work together correctly and that the API behaves as expected under various conditions.

## Entry points

The main entry point for the integration tests is the `API` function in `api.go`. This function orchestrates the entire test suite, setting up the test environment and running various test suites. It takes a testing context, a context.Context, and test options as inputs.

The `API` function in `api_test.go` is another important entry point, specifically for API-related tests. It sets up a test harness and executes API-related tests within a specified namespace context.

The code flow typically follows this pattern:
1. Set up the test environment with specific configurations.
2. Create a client using the provided options.
3. Run a series of nested tests for different API functionalities.
4. Clean up the test environment after completion.

## Key Files

1. `api.go`: This file contains the main integration test suite for Flipt. It includes functions for setting up different database backends, caching configurations, and storage options. It also contains test functions for various Flipt features such as snapshots, import/export, authentication, and authorization.

2. `api_test.go`: This file focuses specifically on API-related tests. It contains nested tests for different API functionalities, including namespaces, flags and variants, segments and constraints, rules and distributions, and boolean rollouts.

## Dependencies

The integration tests rely on several external libraries and frameworks:

1. Go standard library packages: testing, context, crypto, encoding/json, fmt, os, path, runtime, strings, time
2. github.com/containerd/containerd/platforms: For platform-specific operations
3. github.com/go-jose/go-jose/v3: For JSON Object Signing and Encryption
4. github.com/google/go-cmp/cmp: For deep equality comparisons
5. github.com/google/uuid: For UUID generation
6. github.com/hashicorp/cap/jwt: For JWT handling
7. go.flipt.io/build/internal/dagger: Internal build tool
8. go.flipt.io/stew/config: For configuration management
9. golang.org/x/sync/errgroup: For error group synchronization
10. gopkg.in/yaml.v3: For YAML parsing

These dependencies are chosen to provide robust testing capabilities, handle various data formats, and interact with different storage and authentication systems.

## Configuration

The integration tests use various configuration options to set up different test scenarios. These configurations include:

1. Database backends: SQLite, LibSQL, PostgreSQL, MySQL, CockroachDB
2. Caching options: with and without TLS
3. Storage backends: local filesystem, Git, S3, OCI, Azure Blob Storage
4. Authentication and authorization settings
5. Webhook configurations, including template support

The `integration.TestOpts` struct is used to pass these configuration options to the test functions. This allows for flexible and comprehensive testing across different Flipt configurations.

Example code snippet for setting up a test with SQLite backend:

```go
withSQLite := func(t *testing.T, ctx context.Context, opts integration.TestOpts) {
    // SQLite setup logic
    // ...
    API(t, ctx, opts)
}
```

The integration tests are designed to be comprehensive and cover a wide range of scenarios, ensuring the reliability and correctness of the Flipt feature flag management system across various configurations and use cases.
