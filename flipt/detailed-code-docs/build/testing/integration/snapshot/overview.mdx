## High-level description
This code implements an integration test for the evaluation data snapshot API in the Flipt project. It tests the functionality of retrieving snapshots for different namespaces and verifies the behavior of the API when using ETags for caching.

## Code Structure
The test is structured as a single function `TestSnapshot` that uses the `integration.Harness` to set up the test environment. It contains nested test cases for different namespaces and API behaviors.

## Symbols

### TestSnapshot
#### Description
This function is the main test function that sets up the integration test harness and runs the snapshot API tests.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| t | *testing.T | The testing object provided by Go's testing framework |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up the integration test harness using `integration.Harness`.
2. Skips the test if the protocol is gRPC, as these tests are specific to REST.
3. Runs a subtest "Evaluation Data" that iterates through different namespaces.
4. For each namespace, it performs two API calls:
   - First call: Retrieves the snapshot and checks the response.
   - Second call: Uses the ETag from the first call to test caching behavior.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| github.com/stretchr/testify/assert | Provides assertion functions for testing |
| github.com/stretchr/testify/require | Provides requirement functions for testing |
| go.flipt.io/build/testing/integration | Custom integration testing package for Flipt |

## Error Handling
The test uses `require.NoError` to ensure that no errors occur during HTTP requests and response handling. If an error occurs, the test will fail immediately.

## API/Interface Reference
| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| /internal/v1/evaluation/snapshot/namespace/{namespace} | GET | - | Snapshot data | Retrieves the evaluation data snapshot for a given namespace |

The API supports ETag-based caching, which is tested in the second API call for each namespace.

___

This integration test focuses on verifying the behavior of the evaluation data snapshot API in the Flipt project. It ensures that the API correctly returns snapshot data for different namespaces and properly handles ETag-based caching. The test is designed to run only for REST protocol and skips execution for gRPC, demonstrating a clear separation of concerns in the testing strategy.
