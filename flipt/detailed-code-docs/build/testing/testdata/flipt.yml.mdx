## High-level description
This YAML file defines configuration for a feature flag system, likely for the Flipt platform. It specifies a single feature flag with its variants and rules, as well as a segment with constraints for targeting specific users or environments.

## Symbols

### flags
#### Description
Defines a list of feature flags in the system.

#### Internal Logic
The file contains one feature flag with the following structure:
- Key and name for identification
- Description
- Enabled status
- Variants (different versions or options for the flag)
- Rules for flag distribution

### segments
#### Description
Defines a list of segments used for targeting specific users or environments.

#### Internal Logic
The file contains one segment with the following structure:
- Key and name for identification
- Description
- Constraints for determining segment membership

## Configuration

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| flags | list | N/A | List of feature flags |
| segments | list | N/A | List of segments for targeting |

### Flag Configuration

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| key | string | N/A | Unique identifier for the flag |
| name | string | N/A | Human-readable name for the flag |
| description | string | N/A | Brief description of the flag's purpose |
| enabled | boolean | N/A | Whether the flag is currently active |
| variants | list | N/A | Different versions or options for the flag |
| rules | list | N/A | Rules for flag distribution |

### Segment Configuration

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| key | string | N/A | Unique identifier for the segment |
| name | string | N/A | Human-readable name for the segment |
| description | string | N/A | Brief description of the segment's purpose |
| constraints | list | N/A | Conditions for segment membership |

## Dependencies
This YAML file is likely used by the Flipt feature flag management system. The structure and naming conventions suggest it's a configuration file for Flipt.

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Flipt | Feature flag management platform that likely uses this configuration file |

## API/Interface Reference
While this is not an API definition, it represents a configuration that would be consumed by the Flipt system. The structure of this YAML file effectively defines an interface for how feature flags and segments are configured in the system.

| Section | Purpose | Description |
|:--------|:--------|:------------|
| flags | Feature Flag Definition | Defines feature flags with their properties, variants, and distribution rules |
| segments | Segment Definition | Defines segments with their properties and constraints for targeting |

This configuration file allows for fine-grained control over feature flag behavior and user targeting within the Flipt system.
