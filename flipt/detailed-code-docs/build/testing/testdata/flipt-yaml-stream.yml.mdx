## High-level description
This YAML file contains configuration data for feature flags and segments in two different namespaces: "foo" and "bar". It defines flags with variants and rules, as well as segments with constraints, which are commonly used in feature flag management systems like Flipt.

## Code Structure
The file is structured as a YAML stream with two documents, separated by `---`. Each document represents a different namespace but contains similar structures for flags and segments.

## Symbols

### Namespace: foo
#### Description
The first document in the YAML stream, defining flags and segments for the "foo" namespace.

#### Internal Logic
- Defines one flag with two variants and one rule
- Defines one segment with two constraints

### Namespace: bar
#### Description
The second document in the YAML stream, defining flags and segments for the "bar" namespace.

#### Internal Logic
- Defines one flag with two variants and one rule
- Defines one segment with two constraints

### Flag: zUFtS7D0UyMeueYu
#### Description
A feature flag definition that appears in both namespaces.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| key | string | Unique identifier for the flag |
| name | string | Display name for the flag |
| description | string | Brief description of the flag's purpose |
| enabled | boolean | Whether the flag is currently active |
| variants | array | List of possible variations for the flag |
| rules | array | List of rules determining flag behavior |

#### Internal Logic
- Defines two variants: NGxfcVffpMhBz9n8 and sDGD6NvfCRyaQUn3
- Specifies one rule linked to a segment with a 100% rollout for the NGxfcVffpMhBz9n8 variant

### Segment: 08UoVJ96LhZblPEx
#### Description
A segment definition that appears in both namespaces.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| key | string | Unique identifier for the segment |
| name | string | Display name for the segment |
| description | string | Brief description of the segment's purpose |
| constraints | array | List of conditions defining the segment |

#### Internal Logic
- Defines two constraints:
  1. String comparison: property "foo" must equal "baz"
  2. String comparison: property "fizz" must not equal "buzz"

## Configuration
The file defines the following configuration options:

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| namespace | string | N/A | The namespace for the flags and segments |
| flags | array | N/A | List of feature flags |
| segments | array | N/A | List of segments |

## API/Interface Reference
While this is not an API definition, the structure implies the following interfaces:

| Entity | Properties | Description |
|:-------|:-----------|:------------|
| Flag | key, name, description, enabled, variants, rules | Defines a feature flag |
| Variant | key, name | Defines a variation of a flag |
| Rule | segment, rank, distributions | Defines how a flag behaves for a segment |
| Segment | key, name, description, constraints | Defines a group of users or entities |
| Constraint | type, property, operator, value | Defines a condition for segment membership |

This YAML configuration can be used to set up feature flags and segments in a feature management system, allowing for controlled rollout of features to different user groups based on defined criteria.
