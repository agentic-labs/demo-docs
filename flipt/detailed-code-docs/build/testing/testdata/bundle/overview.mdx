## High-level description
This directory contains configuration files for a feature flag management system, likely Flipt. It includes a main configuration file (.flipt.yml) and two feature definition files (a.features.yml and b.features.json) that define feature flags for different namespaces.

## What does it do?
This directory sets up a feature flag system that allows developers to control the availability and behavior of different features in their application. Feature flags are used to enable or disable functionality, or to choose between different variants of a feature. 

The system is organized into namespaces, which are like categories or groups for related flags. In this case, there are two namespaces: "a" and "b". Each namespace has its own set of feature flags.

For example, in namespace "a", there are two flags:
1. "One" - a variant flag that might be used to choose between different versions of a feature.
2. "Two" - a boolean flag that can be used to simply turn a feature on or off.

Similarly, namespace "b" has two flags:
1. "Three" - another variant flag.
2. "Four" - another boolean flag.

Developers can use these flags in their code to control which features are active or which version of a feature to use. This allows for easier testing, gradual rollouts of new features, or quick disabling of problematic features without redeploying the entire application.

## Key Files
1. `.flipt.yml`: This is the main configuration file for the Flipt system. It specifies the configuration version and includes the other feature definition files.

2. `a.features.yml`: This YAML file defines feature flags for namespace "a". It includes two flags: "One" (a variant flag) and "Two" (a boolean flag).

3. `b.features.json`: This JSON file defines feature flags for namespace "b". It also includes two flags: "Three" (a variant flag) and "Four" (a boolean flag).

## Dependencies
The primary dependency implied by these configuration files is Flipt, a feature flag management system. The version of Flipt is not explicitly specified, but the configuration format version is set to "1.0" in the .flipt.yml file.

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Flipt | Feature flag management system |

## Configuration
The configuration is spread across three files:

1. `.flipt.yml`:
   ```yaml
   version: "1.0"
   include:
     - a.features.yml
     - b.features.json
   ```
   This file specifies the configuration version and includes the other feature definition files.

2. `a.features.yml`:
   ```yaml
   namespace: a
   flags:
     - key: one
       name: One
       type: VARIANT_FLAG_TYPE
     - key: two
       name: Two
       type: BOOLEAN_FLAG_TYPE
   ```
   This file defines two flags in namespace "a": a variant flag "One" and a boolean flag "Two".

3. `b.features.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "namespace": "b",
     "flags": [
       {
         "key": "three",
         "name": "Three",
         "type": "VARIANT_FLAG_TYPE"
       },
       {
         "key": "four",
         "name": "Four",
         "type": "BOOLEAN_FLAG_TYPE"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```
   This file defines two flags in namespace "b": a variant flag "Three" and a boolean flag "Four".

The configuration options across these files are:

| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| version | string | Specifies the version of the Flipt configuration format |
| include | array of strings | Lists additional feature definition files to be included |
| namespace | string | Defines the namespace for a set of flags |
| flags | array | List of flag definitions |
| flags[].key | string | Unique identifier for each flag |
| flags[].name | string | Human-readable name for each flag |
| flags[].type | string | Type of the flag (VARIANT_FLAG_TYPE or BOOLEAN_FLAG_TYPE) |

This configuration sets up a feature flag system with two namespaces, each containing two flags. The system supports both YAML and JSON formats for feature definitions, providing flexibility in how the flags are defined.
