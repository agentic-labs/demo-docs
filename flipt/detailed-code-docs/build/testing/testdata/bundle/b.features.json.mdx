## High-level description
This JSON file defines feature flags for a namespace "b". It contains configuration for two feature flags: "three" and "four", with different types and properties.

### JSON Structure
#### Description
The JSON structure defines a configuration for feature flags within a specific namespace. It contains an array of flag objects, each with properties defining the flag's key, name, and type.

#### Internal Logic
The JSON object has two main properties:
1. `namespace`: Specifies the namespace for the feature flags (in this case, "b").
2. `flags`: An array of flag objects, each containing:
   - `key`: A unique identifier for the flag
   - `name`: A human-readable name for the flag
   - `type`: The type of the flag, which determines its behavior

### Namespace
#### Description
The namespace is set to "b", indicating that these feature flags belong to a specific group or section of the application identified as "b".

### Flags
#### Description
The `flags` array contains two feature flag definitions:

1. Flag "three":
   - `key`: "three"
   - `name`: "Three"
   - `type`: "VARIANT_FLAG_TYPE"

2. Flag "four":
   - `key`: "four"
   - `name`: "Four"
   - `type`: "BOOLEAN_FLAG_TYPE"

#### Internal Logic
- The "three" flag is of type "VARIANT_FLAG_TYPE", which suggests it can have multiple variants or options.
- The "four" flag is of type "BOOLEAN_FLAG_TYPE", indicating it's a simple on/off toggle.

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| namespace | string | Identifies the group or section these flags belong to (value: "b") |
| flags | array | Contains the feature flag definitions |

For each flag in the `flags` array:
| Option | Type | Description |
| key | string | Unique identifier for the flag |
| name | string | Human-readable name for the flag |
| type | string | Determines the behavior of the flag (e.g., "VARIANT_FLAG_TYPE" or "BOOLEAN_FLAG_TYPE") |

This JSON configuration file is likely used by a feature flag system to determine which flags are available in the "b" namespace and how they should behave. The application code would reference these flags by their keys ("three" and "four") to enable or disable features or to choose between variants based on the flag type.
