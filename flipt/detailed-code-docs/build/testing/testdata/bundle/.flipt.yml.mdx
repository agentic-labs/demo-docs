2. Two additional files are included:
   - `a.features.yml`: Likely contains feature definitions in YAML format.
   - `b.features.json`: Likely contains feature definitions in JSON format.
3. The inclusion of both YAML and JSON files suggests that Flipt supports multiple formats for feature definitions.
4. This file serves as the main configuration file, acting as an entry point for the Flipt system in this specific context or project.
5. The actual feature definitions are not present in this file but are referenced through the `include` directive, promoting a modular and organized approach to feature management.
