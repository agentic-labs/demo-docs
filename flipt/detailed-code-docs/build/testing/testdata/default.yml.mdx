## High-level description
This YAML file defines logging configuration settings for a system or application. It specifies the log level for general logging and a separate log level for gRPC-related logging.

## Symbols

### `log`
#### Description
The `log` key represents the root configuration for logging settings.

#### Internal Logic
The `log` section contains two sub-keys: `level` and `grpc_level`, each specifying different logging levels for different components of the system.

___

### `level`
#### Description
Specifies the general logging level for the application.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| level | string | The log level set to "INFO" |

___

### `grpc_level`
#### Description
Specifies the logging level specifically for gRPC-related operations.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| grpc_level | string | The gRPC log level set to "ERROR" |

___

## Configuration
This YAML file defines configuration options for logging. Here's a table of the options:

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| log.level | string | INFO | Sets the general logging level for the application |
| log.grpc_level | string | ERROR | Sets the logging level specifically for gRPC-related operations |

## Dependencies
This configuration file implies the use of a logging system that supports different log levels, including a separate configuration for gRPC logging. While not explicitly stated, this suggests the following dependencies:

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Logging framework | To handle general application logging |
| gRPC | For gRPC-related operations, which have a separate log level |

Note: The specific logging framework and gRPC implementation are not mentioned in the file, but their use is implied by the configuration structure.
