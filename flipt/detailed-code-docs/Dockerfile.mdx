title: "Dockerfile"
---

## High-level description
This Dockerfile defines a multi-stage build process for the Flipt application. It creates a lightweight Alpine-based Docker image with the Flipt binary, necessary configurations, and runtime dependencies. The build process compiles the Go application and sets up the environment for running Flipt.

## Code Structure
The Dockerfile consists of two main stages: the build stage and the final stage. The build stage compiles the Flipt application, while the final stage creates the runtime environment.

## Symbols

### Build Stage
#### Description
This stage sets up the build environment, compiles the Flipt application, and prepares the binary for the final image.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses `golang:1.22-alpine3.19` as the base image
2. Sets the working directory to `/home/flipt`
3. Installs necessary build dependencies
4. Clones and builds the Mage build tool
5. Copies Go module files and specific directories
6. Downloads Go module dependencies
7. Copies the entire project to the container
8. Builds the Flipt application using Mage

### Final Stage
#### Description
This stage creates the final, lightweight runtime image for Flipt.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses `alpine:3.19` as the base image
2. Adds labels for maintainer information and image metadata
3. Installs runtime dependencies
4. Creates necessary directories for Flipt
5. Copies the Flipt binary from the build stage
6. Copies configuration files
7. Creates a non-root user and group for running Flipt
8. Sets appropriate permissions for Flipt directories
9. Exposes ports 8080 and 9000
10. Sets the user to `flipt`
11. Defines the command to run Flipt

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| golang:1.22-alpine3.19 | Base image for building the application |
| alpine:3.19 | Base image for the final runtime container |
| npm | Build dependency |
| git | Used to clone Mage repository |
| bash | Build dependency |
| gcc | Build dependency |
| build-base | Build dependency |
| binutils-gold | Build dependency |
| postgresql-client | Runtime dependency for database connectivity |
| openssl | Runtime dependency for SSL/TLS support |
| ca-certificates | Runtime dependency for SSL/TLS certificate validation |

## Configuration
The Dockerfile copies configuration files from `config/*.yml` to `/etc/flipt/config/` in the final image.

## Error Handling
No specific error handling mechanisms are implemented in the Dockerfile. The build process will fail if any step encounters an error.

## Logging
No specific logging configuration is present in the Dockerfile. Logging behavior would be determined by the Flipt application itself.

## API/Interface Reference
The Dockerfile exposes two ports:
| Port | Purpose |
|:-----|:--------|
| 8080 | Likely for the main application interface |
| 9000 | Possibly for metrics or administrative interface |

## Performance Considerations
1. Multi-stage build is used to minimize the final image size by excluding build dependencies.
2. Alpine-based images are used for both build and runtime stages, which are known for their small footprint.
3. The application is built with CGO enabled (`CGO_ENABLED=1`), which may impact performance and portability.

## Security Considerations
1. A non-root user `flipt` is created and used to run the application, following the principle of least privilege.
2. Permissions are set appropriately for Flipt directories.
3. The latest Alpine 3.19 is used, which should include recent security updates.
