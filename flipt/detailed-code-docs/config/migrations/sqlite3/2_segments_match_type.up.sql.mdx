title: "2_segments_match_type.up.sql"

## High-level description
This SQL migration file adds a new column called `match_type` to the `segments` table in a SQLite3 database. The new column is designed to store an integer value with a default of 0 and is set to be non-nullable.

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE segments ADD COLUMN match_type INTEGER DEFAULT 0 NOT NULL
#### Description
This SQL statement modifies the existing `segments` table by adding a new column named `match_type`.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `ALTER TABLE` command is used to modify the structure of the existing `segments` table.
2. `ADD COLUMN` specifies that a new column is being added to the table.
3. The new column is named `match_type`.
4. The data type of the column is set to `INTEGER`.
5. `DEFAULT 0` sets the default value for this column to 0, meaning if no value is specified when inserting a new row, it will automatically be set to 0.
6. `NOT NULL` constraint ensures that this column cannot contain null values.

## Side Effects
- This migration will modify the structure of the `segments` table in the database.
- All existing rows in the `segments` table will have the `match_type` column added with a value of 0.
- Future insertions into the `segments` table will require a value for `match_type` (or will use the default value of 0).

## Performance Considerations
- Depending on the size of the `segments` table, this operation might take some time to complete, as it needs to update all existing rows.
- If there are any indexes on the `segments` table, they may need to be rebuilt after this operation.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| SQLite3    | This migration is specifically for SQLite3 databases, as indicated by the file path. |

Note: The migration is designed for SQLite3, which handles ALTER TABLE operations differently from some other database systems. In SQLite3, this operation is generally quick as it doesn't physically reorganize the table data.
