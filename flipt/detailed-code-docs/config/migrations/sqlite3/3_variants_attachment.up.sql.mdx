## High-level description
This SQL migration file adds a new column named 'attachment' to the 'variants' table in a SQLite3 database. The new column is of type TEXT and is positioned after the 'description' column.

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE variants ADD COLUMN attachment TEXT AFTER description;
#### Description
This SQL statement modifies the structure of the 'variants' table by adding a new column called 'attachment'.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `ALTER TABLE` command is used to modify an existing table structure.
2. `variants` is the name of the table being altered.
3. `ADD COLUMN` specifies that a new column is being added to the table.
4. `attachment` is the name of the new column being added.
5. `TEXT` is the data type of the new column, which can store string data of variable length.
6. `AFTER description` specifies that the new 'attachment' column should be positioned immediately after the existing 'description' column in the table structure.

## Side Effects
- This migration will modify the structure of the 'variants' table in the database.
- Any existing rows in the 'variants' table will have a NULL value in the new 'attachment' column unless a default value is specified (which is not the case in this migration).
- Applications or queries that rely on the structure of the 'variants' table may need to be updated to account for the new column.

## Performance Considerations
- Adding a column to an existing table in SQLite is generally a fast operation, as it doesn't require rewriting the entire table.
- However, if the table contains a large number of rows, this operation might take longer to complete.
