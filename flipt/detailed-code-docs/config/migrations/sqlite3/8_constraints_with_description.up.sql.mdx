## High-level description
This SQL migration file adds a new column called 'description' to the 'constraints' table in a SQLite3 database. The purpose is to allow storing additional textual information about each constraint.

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE constraints ADD COLUMN description TEXT;
#### Description
This SQL statement modifies the existing 'constraints' table by adding a new column named 'description' of type TEXT.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `ALTER TABLE` command is used to modify the structure of an existing table.
2. `constraints` is the name of the table being altered.
3. `ADD COLUMN` specifies that a new column is being added to the table.
4. `description` is the name of the new column being added.
5. `TEXT` is the data type of the new column, allowing for storage of variable-length string data.

## Side Effects
- This migration will modify the structure of the 'constraints' table in the database.
- Existing rows in the 'constraints' table will have a NULL value in the new 'description' column unless a default value is specified (which is not the case in this migration).
- Any applications or queries that interact with the 'constraints' table will now have access to this additional 'description' column.
