title: "4_create_table_authentications.up.sql"
---

## High-level description
This SQL script creates a table named `authentications` in a SQLite3 database. The table is designed to store authentication-related information, including client tokens, authentication methods, and associated metadata. It also creates a unique index on the `hashed_client_token` column for efficient lookups.

## Code Structure
The script consists of two main SQL statements: one to create the `authentications` table and another to create a unique index on the `hashed_client_token` column.

## Symbols

### CREATE TABLE authentications
#### Description
This SQL statement creates the `authentications` table if it doesn't already exist. The table is designed to store various authentication-related data points.

#### Internal Logic
The table is created with the following columns:
1. `id`: A unique identifier for each authentication record.
2. `hashed_client_token`: A hashed version of the client token used for authentication.
3. `method`: An integer representing the authentication method used.
4. `metadata`: Additional information about the authentication in text format.
5. `expires_at`: A timestamp indicating when the authentication expires.
6. `created_at`: A timestamp of when the record was created.
7. `updated_at`: A timestamp of when the record was last updated.

The `id` and `hashed_client_token` columns are set as unique to ensure no duplicate entries. The `created_at` and `updated_at` columns are automatically set to the current timestamp when a record is inserted.

### CREATE UNIQUE INDEX hashed_client_token_authentications_index
#### Description
This SQL statement creates a unique index on the `hashed_client_token` column of the `authentications` table.

#### Internal Logic
The index is created to improve query performance when searching or filtering by `hashed_client_token`. The `UNIQUE` keyword ensures that no two rows can have the same `hashed_client_token` value, providing an additional layer of data integrity.

## Performance Considerations
1. The unique index on `hashed_client_token` will improve the performance of queries that search or filter by this column.
2. The `id` column is set as the primary key, which automatically creates an index on this column, optimizing queries that use the `id` for lookups.

## Dependencies
This script is designed for SQLite3 databases, as indicated by the filename. It uses SQLite3-specific syntax and features.

## Error Handling
The `IF NOT EXISTS` clause in the `CREATE TABLE` statement prevents errors if the table already exists. This allows the script to be run multiple times without causing conflicts.
