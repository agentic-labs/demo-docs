## High-level description
This SQL script performs a migration to modify the `variants` table in a SQLite database. It adds a unique constraint on the combination of `flag_key` and `key` columns while preserving the existing data. The script uses a workaround to overcome SQLite's limitation of not allowing direct alteration of unique constraints.

## Code Structure
The script follows a sequence of SQL commands to create a temporary table, copy data, drop the original table, and rename the temporary table. It also manages foreign key constraints during the process.

### SQL Commands

#### Description
The script consists of several SQL commands executed in sequence to achieve the desired table modification.

#### Internal Logic
1. Disable foreign key constraints temporarily.
2. Create a new temporary table `variants_temp` with the desired schema, including the new unique constraint.
3. Copy all data from the existing `variants` table to `variants_temp`.
4. Drop the original `variants` table.
5. Rename `variants_temp` to `variants`.
6. Re-enable foreign key constraints.

## Side Effects
- The script modifies the database schema by altering the `variants` table.
- Existing data in the `variants` table is preserved but moved to a new table structure.
- Foreign key constraints are temporarily disabled during the migration process.

## Performance Considerations
- This migration may take longer for large tables as it involves copying all data to a new table.
- Temporarily disabling foreign key constraints could impact data integrity if the migration fails midway.

## Error Handling
The script does not include explicit error handling. It relies on SQLite's default error handling mechanisms.

## TODOs
The script includes a comment explaining the reason for this approach:
```sql
/* SQLite doesn't allow you to drop unique constraints with ALTER TABLE
   so we have to create a new table with the schema we want and copy the data over.
   https://www.sqlite.org/lang_altertable.html
*/
```
This comment serves as documentation for why this specific migration approach is used.
