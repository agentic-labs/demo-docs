## High-level description
This SQL script creates a table named `operation_lock` in a SQLite3 database. The table is designed to manage and track locks for various operations, including information about when the lock was acquired and when it expires.

## Symbols

### `operation_lock` table
#### Description
The `operation_lock` table is created to store information about locks on different operations. It includes fields for the operation name, version, acquisition time, and expiration time.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| operation | VARCHAR(255) | The name or identifier of the operation being locked |
| version | INTEGER | A version number for the lock, defaulting to 0 |
| last_acquired_at | TIMESTAMP | The timestamp when the lock was last acquired |
| acquired_until | TIMESTAMP | The timestamp until which the lock is valid |

#### Internal Logic
The table is created with the following structure and constraints:
1. `operation` is the primary key and is set as UNIQUE and NOT NULL, ensuring each operation has a unique entry.
2. `version` is an integer field with a default value of 0 and is NOT NULL.
3. `last_acquired_at` and `acquired_until` are TIMESTAMP fields that default to the current timestamp (CURRENT_TIMESTAMP).
4. The `IF NOT EXISTS` clause ensures the table is only created if it doesn't already exist in the database.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| SQLite3 | The database system for which this migration script is written |

## Configuration
This SQL script doesn't include any configurable options. It's a straightforward table creation statement.

## Error Handling
The script uses the `IF NOT EXISTS` clause to prevent errors if the table already exists. This allows the migration to be run multiple times without causing conflicts.

## API/Interface Reference
While this is not an API, the table structure defines an interface for interacting with operation locks:

| Field | Type | Constraints | Description |
|:------|:-----|:------------|:------------|
| operation | VARCHAR(255) | PRIMARY KEY, UNIQUE, NOT NULL | Identifier for the operation |
| version | INTEGER | DEFAULT 0, NOT NULL | Version number of the lock |
| last_acquired_at | TIMESTAMP | DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP | When the lock was last acquired |
| acquired_until | TIMESTAMP | DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP | When the lock expires |

This table can be queried and updated to manage locks on various operations within the system.
