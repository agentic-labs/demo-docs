## High-level description
This SQL migration file adds a new column named `metadata` of type JSON to the `flags` table in a SQLite3 database. This change allows for storing additional, flexible metadata associated with each flag entry.

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE flags ADD COLUMN metadata JSON
#### Description
This SQL statement modifies the structure of the existing `flags` table by adding a new column called `metadata`.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `ALTER TABLE` command is used to modify the structure of an existing table.
2. `flags` is the name of the table being altered.
3. `ADD COLUMN` specifies that a new column is being added to the table.
4. `metadata` is the name of the new column being added.
5. `JSON` is the data type of the new column, which allows for storing JSON-formatted data.

## Side Effects
- This migration will modify the structure of the `flags` table in the database.
- Existing rows in the `flags` table will have a `NULL` value in the new `metadata` column unless a default value is specified (which is not the case in this migration).
- Applications or queries that interact with the `flags` table may need to be updated to handle the new `metadata` column.

## Performance Considerations
- Adding a new column to an existing table with a large number of rows might take some time to complete, depending on the size of the table and the database engine's implementation.
- The JSON data type in SQLite3 allows for efficient storage and querying of JSON data, but complex JSON operations might have performance implications compared to traditional column types.
