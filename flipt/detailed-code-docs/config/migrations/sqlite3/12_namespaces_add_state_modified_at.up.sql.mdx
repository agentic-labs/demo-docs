## High-level description
This SQL migration file adds a new column named `state_modified_at` of type `TIMESTAMP` to the `namespaces` table in a SQLite3 database. This column is likely intended to track when the state of a namespace was last modified.

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE namespaces ADD COLUMN state_modified_at TIMESTAMP;
#### Description
This SQL statement alters the existing `namespaces` table by adding a new column called `state_modified_at` with the data type `TIMESTAMP`.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `ALTER TABLE` command is used to modify the structure of an existing table.
2. `namespaces` is the name of the table being altered.
3. `ADD COLUMN` specifies that a new column is being added to the table.
4. `state_modified_at` is the name of the new column being added.
5. `TIMESTAMP` is the data type of the new column, which will store date and time information.

## Side Effects
- This migration will modify the structure of the `namespaces` table in the database.
- Existing rows in the `namespaces` table will have a `NULL` value for the new `state_modified_at` column unless a default value is specified (which is not the case in this migration).
- Any queries or application code that interacts with the `namespaces` table will need to be aware of this new column to avoid potential errors or to make use of the new data.

## Performance Considerations
- Adding a new column to an existing table with a large number of rows can be a potentially time-consuming operation, depending on the size of the table and the database engine's implementation.
- In SQLite3, adding a new column is generally a fast operation as it doesn't require rewriting the entire table.

## Dependencies
This migration assumes the existence of a SQLite3 database with a `namespaces` table.
