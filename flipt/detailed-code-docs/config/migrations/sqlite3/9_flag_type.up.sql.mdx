## High-level description
This SQL migration file adds a new column named `type` to the `flags` table in a SQLite3 database. The new column is designed to store integer values, with a default value of 0 and a NOT NULL constraint.

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE flags ADD COLUMN `type` INTEGER DEFAULT 0 NOT NULL;
#### Description
This SQL statement modifies the structure of the existing `flags` table by adding a new column called `type`.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `ALTER TABLE` command is used to modify the structure of the `flags` table.
2. `ADD COLUMN` specifies that a new column is being added to the table.
3. The new column is named `type`.
4. The data type of the column is set to `INTEGER`.
5. `DEFAULT 0` sets the default value for this column to 0, meaning if no value is specified when inserting a new row, it will automatically be set to 0.
6. `NOT NULL` constraint ensures that this column cannot contain NULL values.

## Side Effects
- This migration will modify the structure of the `flags` table in the database.
- Existing rows in the `flags` table will have the new `type` column added with the default value of 0.
- Future insertions into the `flags` table will require a value for the `type` column (or will use the default value of 0 if not specified).
