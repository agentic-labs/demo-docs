## High-level description
This SQL migration file adds a new column `default_variant_id` to the `flags` table in a SQLite3 database. The column is designed to reference the `id` column in the `variants` table, establishing a foreign key relationship.

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE `flags`
#### Description
This SQL command modifies the structure of the existing `flags` table by adding a new column.

#### Internal Logic
1. Targets the `flags` table for modification.
2. Adds a new column named `default_variant_id`.
3. Sets the data type of the new column to `VARCHAR(255)`.
4. Establishes a foreign key relationship with the `variants` table.
5. Implements an ON DELETE SET NULL constraint.

## Side Effects
- The `flags` table structure is permanently altered.
- A new foreign key relationship is established between the `flags` and `variants` tables.
- If a referenced variant is deleted, the `default_variant_id` in the `flags` table will be set to NULL.

## Performance Considerations
- Adding a new column to an existing table can be a potentially slow operation, especially if the table contains a large number of rows.
- The foreign key relationship may slightly impact the performance of insert and update operations on the `flags` table, as the database will need to check the `variants` table for referential integrity.

## Error Handling
This migration does not include explicit error handling. If the migration fails (e.g., if the `flags` table doesn't exist or if there's a naming conflict), the database system will roll back the changes and report an error.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in this migration file.
