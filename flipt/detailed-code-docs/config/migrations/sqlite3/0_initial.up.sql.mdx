## High-level description
This SQL script defines the initial database schema for a feature flag management system using SQLite3. It creates six tables: flags, segments, variants, constraints, rules, and distributions, which together form the structure for managing feature flags, user segments, and rule-based flag distribution.

## Code Structure
The script consists of six `CREATE TABLE` statements, each defining a table with its columns, data types, constraints, and relationships. The tables are interconnected through foreign key references, creating a relational structure for the feature flag system.

## Symbols

### CREATE TABLE flags
#### Description
Creates a table to store feature flags.

#### Internal Logic
- Defines a primary key `key` as a unique, non-null VARCHAR(255)
- Includes columns for name, description, enabled status, and timestamps
- Uses `TIMESTAMP` type with `DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` for `created_at` and `updated_at`

### CREATE TABLE segments
#### Description
Creates a table to store user segments.

#### Internal Logic
- Similar structure to the flags table, but without the `enabled` column
- Uses `key` as the primary key

### CREATE TABLE variants
#### Description
Creates a table to store variants of feature flags.

#### Internal Logic
- Defines `id` as the primary key
- Includes a foreign key `flag_key` referencing the flags table
- Has a unique `key` column separate from the `id`

### CREATE TABLE constraints
#### Description
Creates a table to store constraints for segments.

#### Internal Logic
- Defines `id` as the primary key
- Includes a foreign key `segment_key` referencing the segments table
- Uses an INTEGER `type` column with a default value of 0
- Stores constraint details in `property`, `operator`, and `value` columns

### CREATE TABLE rules
#### Description
Creates a table to store rules that link flags to segments.

#### Internal Logic
- Defines `id` as the primary key
- Includes foreign keys `flag_key` and `segment_key` referencing the flags and segments tables respectively
- Has a `rank` column to determine rule priority

### CREATE TABLE distributions
#### Description
Creates a table to store distribution rules for variants.

#### Internal Logic
- Defines `id` as the primary key
- Includes foreign keys `rule_id` and `variant_id` referencing the rules and variants tables respectively
- Uses a `float` type for the `rollout` column to store distribution percentages

## Dependencies
This script relies on SQLite3 as the database management system.

## Error Handling
The script uses `IF NOT EXISTS` clauses to prevent errors if the tables already exist. Foreign key constraints are used to maintain data integrity across tables.

## Performance Considerations
- The use of `VARCHAR(255)` for keys and names might impact performance for very large datasets. Consider adjusting these sizes based on expected data characteristics.
- Indexes are not explicitly defined, which might affect query performance on large tables. Consider adding indexes on frequently queried columns or foreign keys.
