## High-level description
This SQL script creates two new tables: `rule_segments` and `rollout_segment_references`. These tables establish relationships between rules and segments, and between rollout segments and segments, respectively. The script also populates these new tables with existing data from the `rules` and `rollout_segments` tables.

## Symbols

### Table: rule_segments
#### Description
This table establishes a many-to-many relationship between rules and segments. It allows multiple segments to be associated with a single rule and vice versa.

#### Columns
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| rule_id | VARCHAR(255) | The ID of the rule, references the `rules` table |
| namespace_key | VARCHAR(255) | The namespace key of the segment |
| segment_key | VARCHAR(255) | The key of the segment |

#### Constraints
- Primary Key: (rule_id, namespace_key, segment_key)
- Foreign Key: rule_id references rules(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
- Foreign Key: (namespace_key, segment_key) references segments(namespace_key, key) ON DELETE CASCADE

### Table: rollout_segment_references
#### Description
This table establishes a many-to-many relationship between rollout segments and segments. It allows multiple segments to be associated with a single rollout segment and vice versa.

#### Columns
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| rollout_segment_id | VARCHAR(255) | The ID of the rollout segment, references the `rollout_segments` table |
| namespace_key | VARCHAR(255) | The namespace key of the segment |
| segment_key | VARCHAR(255) | The key of the segment |

#### Constraints
- Primary Key: (rollout_segment_id, namespace_key, segment_key)
- Foreign Key: rollout_segment_id references rollout_segments(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
- Foreign Key: (namespace_key, segment_key) references segments(namespace_key, key) ON DELETE CASCADE

## Internal Logic

1. The script first creates the `rule_segments` table if it doesn't already exist.
2. It then inserts data into the `rule_segments` table by selecting from the `rules` table, mapping the `id` column to `rule_id`.
3. Next, it creates the `rollout_segment_references` table if it doesn't already exist.
4. Finally, it inserts data into the `rollout_segment_references` table by selecting from the `rollout_segments` table, mapping the `id` column to `rollout_segment_id`.

## Side Effects
- This script modifies the database schema by adding two new tables.
- It also populates these new tables with existing data, which may take some time depending on the amount of data in the `rules` and `rollout_segments` tables.

## Performance Considerations
- The insertion operations might be slow if there are a large number of records in the `rules` and `rollout_segments` tables.
- The `ON DELETE CASCADE` constraints ensure referential integrity but may impact performance when deleting records from the referenced tables.

## Dependencies
This script assumes the existence of the following tables:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rules | Referenced by rule_segments table |
| segments | Referenced by both new tables |
| rollout_segments | Referenced by rollout_segment_references table |
