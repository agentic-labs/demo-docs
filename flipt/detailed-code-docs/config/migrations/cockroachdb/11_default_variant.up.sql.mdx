## High-level description
This SQL migration file adds a new column `default_variant_id` to the `flags` table in a CockroachDB database. The column is designed to reference the `id` column in the `variants` table, establishing a foreign key relationship.

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE flags ADD COLUMN default_variant_id
#### Description
This SQL statement modifies the structure of the `flags` table by adding a new column named `default_variant_id`.

#### Internal Logic
1. The new column `default_variant_id` is created in the `flags` table.
2. The column is defined as `VARCHAR(255)`, allowing it to store string values up to 255 characters long.
3. A foreign key constraint is established, referencing the `id` column in the `variants` table.
4. The `ON DELETE SET NULL` clause specifies that if a referenced variant is deleted, the `default_variant_id` will be set to NULL rather than causing an error or cascading deletion.

## Side Effects
- This migration will modify the structure of the `flags` table, potentially affecting existing queries or applications that interact with this table.
- The new column will allow flags to have a default variant, which may change the behavior of flag-related operations in the application.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |

| CockroachDB | The database system for which this migration is designed |

## Error Handling
If the `variants` table or its `id` column does not exist, this migration will fail. Ensure that the `variants` table is properly set up before running this migration.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in this migration file. However, it's important to note that after applying this migration, existing rows in the `flags` table will have NULL values for the new `default_variant_id` column. Depending on the application's requirements, a follow-up migration or data update might be necessary to set appropriate default values for existing flags.
