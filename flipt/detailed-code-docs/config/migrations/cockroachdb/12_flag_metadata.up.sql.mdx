## High-level description
This SQL migration script adds a new column named `metadata` of type JSON to the `flags` table in a CockroachDB database. This change allows for storing additional, flexible metadata associated with each flag in the system.

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE flags ADD COLUMN metadata JSON;
#### Description
This SQL statement modifies the structure of the `flags` table by adding a new column called `metadata` with a JSON data type.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `ALTER TABLE` command is used to modify an existing table structure.
2. `flags` is the name of the table being altered.
3. `ADD COLUMN` specifies that a new column is being added to the table.
4. `metadata` is the name of the new column being added.
5. `JSON` is the data type of the new column, allowing for storage of structured JSON data.

## Side Effects
- This migration will modify the schema of the `flags` table, potentially affecting any existing queries or applications that interact with this table.
- Existing rows in the `flags` table will have a `NULL` value for the new `metadata` column unless a default value is specified (which is not the case in this migration).

## Performance Considerations
- Adding a new column to an existing table with a large number of rows might take some time to complete, depending on the size of the table and the database's current load.
- The JSON data type in CockroachDB allows for efficient storage and querying of JSON data, but large JSON objects may impact performance if not properly indexed or queried.

Note: This migration script is specifically for CockroachDB, as indicated by the file path. CockroachDB is compatible with PostgreSQL, which also supports the JSON data type.
