title: "2_create_table_operation_lock.up.sql"
---

## High-level description
This SQL script creates a table named `operation_lock` in a CockroachDB database. The table is designed to manage and track locks for various operations, including information about the operation, its version, and the time it was last acquired and until when it is acquired.

## Symbols

### `operation_lock` (Table)
#### Description
The `operation_lock` table is created to store information about locks on various operations. It is designed to prevent concurrent execution of the same operation and to track the state of these operations.

#### Columns
| Name | Type | Constraints | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|:------------|
| operation | VARCHAR(255) | PRIMARY KEY, UNIQUE, NOT NULL | The name or identifier of the operation being locked |
| version | INTEGER | DEFAULT 0, NOT NULL | A version number for the operation, starting at 0 |
| last_acquired_at | TIMESTAMP | DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP | The timestamp when the lock was last acquired |
| acquired_until | TIMESTAMP | DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP | The timestamp until which the lock is acquired |

#### Internal Logic
1. The table is created only if it doesn't already exist (`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`).
2. The `operation` column serves as both the primary key and a unique identifier for each lock.
3. The `version` column is initialized with 0 and can be used to track changes or iterations of the operation.
4. Both `last_acquired_at` and `acquired_until` columns are initialized with the current timestamp when a new record is inserted.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| CockroachDB | The database system for which this migration script is written |

## Configuration
This script is likely part of a database migration system, as indicated by its filename (`2_create_table_operation_lock.up.sql`). The number at the beginning of the filename (2) suggests that this is the second migration in a sequence.

## Performance Considerations
- The `operation` column is the primary key, which will automatically create an index for faster lookups.
- Using `VARCHAR(255)` for the `operation` column allows for flexible operation names while limiting their length to 255 characters.

Note: This SQL script is relatively simple and straightforward, focusing on creating a single table with basic constraints and default values. It doesn't include complex logic, error handling, or API definitions, which is typical for database migration scripts.
