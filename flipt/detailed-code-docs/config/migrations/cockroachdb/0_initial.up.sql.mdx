## High-level description
This SQL script defines the initial database schema for a feature flag management system using CockroachDB. It creates six tables: flags, segments, variants, constraints, rules, and distributions, which together form the structure for managing feature flags, user segments, and flag distribution rules.

## Code Structure
The script creates six interconnected tables, each with its own primary key and foreign key relationships. The tables are designed to work together to support a feature flag system with segmentation and distribution capabilities.

## Symbols

### Table: flags
#### Description
Stores information about feature flags.

#### Columns
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| key | VARCHAR(255) | Primary key, unique identifier for the flag |
| name | VARCHAR(255) | Name of the flag |
| description | TEXT | Detailed description of the flag |
| enabled | BOOLEAN | Flag to indicate if the feature is enabled (default: false) |
| created_at | TIMESTAMP | Timestamp of flag creation |
| updated_at | TIMESTAMP | Timestamp of last flag update |

### Table: segments
#### Description
Stores information about user segments for targeting feature flags.

#### Columns
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| key | VARCHAR(255) | Primary key, unique identifier for the segment |
| name | VARCHAR(255) | Name of the segment |
| description | TEXT | Detailed description of the segment |
| match_type | INTEGER | Type of matching for the segment (default: 0) |
| created_at | TIMESTAMP | Timestamp of segment creation |
| updated_at | TIMESTAMP | Timestamp of last segment update |

### Table: variants
#### Description
Stores different variants of a feature flag.

#### Columns
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | VARCHAR(255) | Primary key, unique identifier for the variant |
| flag_key | VARCHAR(255) | Foreign key referencing the flags table |
| key | VARCHAR(255) | Variant key |
| name | VARCHAR(255) | Name of the variant |
| description | TEXT | Detailed description of the variant |
| attachment | JSONB | JSON data associated with the variant |
| created_at | TIMESTAMP | Timestamp of variant creation |
| updated_at | TIMESTAMP | Timestamp of last variant update |

#### Constraints
- Foreign key relationship with the flags table (ON DELETE CASCADE)
- Unique constraint on (flag_key, key) pair

### Table: constraints
#### Description
Stores constraints for user segments.

#### Columns
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | VARCHAR(255) | Primary key, unique identifier for the constraint |
| segment_key | VARCHAR(255) | Foreign key referencing the segments table |
| type | INTEGER | Type of constraint (default: 0) |
| property | VARCHAR(255) | Property to be constrained |
| operator | VARCHAR(255) | Operator for the constraint |
| value | TEXT | Value for the constraint |
| created_at | TIMESTAMP | Timestamp of constraint creation |
| updated_at | TIMESTAMP | Timestamp of last constraint update |

#### Constraints
- Foreign key relationship with the segments table (ON DELETE CASCADE)

### Table: rules
#### Description
Stores rules for applying feature flags to segments.

#### Columns
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | VARCHAR(255) | Primary key, unique identifier for the rule |
| flag_key | VARCHAR(255) | Foreign key referencing the flags table |
| segment_key | VARCHAR(255) | Foreign key referencing the segments table |
| rank | INTEGER | Rank of the rule (default: 1) |
| created_at | TIMESTAMP | Timestamp of rule creation |
| updated_at | TIMESTAMP | Timestamp of last rule update |

#### Constraints
- Foreign key relationships with both flags and segments tables (ON DELETE CASCADE)

### Table: distributions
#### Description
Stores distribution information for flag variants within rules.

#### Columns
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | VARCHAR(255) | Primary key, unique identifier for the distribution |
| rule_id | VARCHAR(255) | Foreign key referencing the rules table |
| variant_id | VARCHAR(255) | Foreign key referencing the variants table |
| rollout | float | Rollout percentage for the variant (default: 0) |
| created_at | TIMESTAMP | Timestamp of distribution creation |
| updated_at | TIMESTAMP | Timestamp of last distribution update |

#### Constraints
- Foreign key relationships with both rules and variants tables (ON DELETE CASCADE)

## Dependencies
This SQL script is designed for CockroachDB, which is compatible with PostgreSQL. It uses CockroachDB-specific features such as:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| CockroachDB | Database system for storing and managing feature flag data |

## Performance Considerations
- The script uses primary keys and foreign keys to ensure data integrity and enable efficient querying.
- The use of VARCHAR(255) for key fields allows for flexible identifiers while maintaining good performance.
- JSONB type is used for the `attachment` field in the `variants` table, allowing for efficient storage and querying of JSON data.

This schema provides a solid foundation for a feature flag management system, allowing for complex flag configurations, user segmentation, and variant distribution rules.
