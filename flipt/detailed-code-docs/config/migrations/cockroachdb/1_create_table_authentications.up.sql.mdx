## High-level description
This SQL script creates a table named `authentications` in a CockroachDB database. The table is designed to store authentication-related information, including unique identifiers, hashed client tokens, authentication methods, metadata, and timestamps for expiration and record management.

## Symbols

### CREATE TABLE authentications
#### Description
This SQL statement creates the `authentications` table if it doesn't already exist. The table is designed to store various authentication-related data points.

#### Internal Logic
The table is created with the following columns:
1. `id`: A unique identifier for each authentication record.
2. `hashed_client_token`: A hashed version of the client token used for authentication.
3. `method`: An integer representing the authentication method used.
4. `metadata`: Additional information stored as text.
5. `expires_at`: A timestamp indicating when the authentication expires.
6. `created_at`: A timestamp for when the record was created.
7. `updated_at`: A timestamp for when the record was last updated.

Key features:
- `id` and `hashed_client_token` are set as UNIQUE to ensure no duplicates.
- `method` has a default value of 0.
- `created_at` and `updated_at` use the `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` as their default value.

### CREATE UNIQUE INDEX hashed_client_token_authentications_index
#### Description
This SQL statement creates a unique index on the `hashed_client_token` column of the `authentications` table.

#### Internal Logic
The index is created to improve query performance when searching or filtering by `hashed_client_token`. The UNIQUE constraint ensures that no two records can have the same `hashed_client_token` value, providing an additional layer of data integrity.

## Performance Considerations
1. The use of indexes on the `hashed_client_token` column will improve query performance for operations involving this field.
2. The UNIQUE constraints on `id` and `hashed_client_token` may slightly impact insert performance but ensure data integrity.

## Dependencies
This script is designed for CockroachDB, which is compatible with PostgreSQL. The syntax used is standard SQL and should work with most SQL databases, but it's optimized for CockroachDB.

## Error Handling
The `IF NOT EXISTS` clause in the CREATE TABLE statement prevents errors if the table already exists, allowing for idempotent execution of this migration script.
