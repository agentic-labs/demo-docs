title: "10_namespaces_add_state_modified_at.up.sql"
---

## High-level description
This SQL migration file adds a new column named `state_modified_at` of type `TIMESTAMP` to the `namespaces` table in a CockroachDB database. This column is likely intended to track when the state of a namespace was last modified.

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE namespaces ADD COLUMN state_modified_at TIMESTAMP;
#### Description
This SQL statement alters the structure of the `namespaces` table by adding a new column called `state_modified_at` with a data type of `TIMESTAMP`.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `ALTER TABLE` command is used to modify the structure of an existing table.
2. `namespaces` is the name of the table being altered.
3. `ADD COLUMN` specifies that a new column is being added to the table.
4. `state_modified_at` is the name of the new column being added.
5. `TIMESTAMP` is the data type of the new column, which can store both date and time information.

## Side Effects
- This migration will modify the schema of the `namespaces` table in the database.
- Existing rows in the `namespaces` table will have a `NULL` value for the new `state_modified_at` column unless a default value is specified (which is not the case in this migration).
- Any applications or queries that interact with the `namespaces` table will now have access to this new column.

## Performance Considerations
- Adding a column to an existing table in CockroachDB is generally a fast operation and does not require copying the entire table.
- However, if the table contains a large number of rows, this operation might take some time to complete.
- It's recommended to run this migration during a maintenance window or a period of low database activity to minimize potential impact on running applications.
