## High-level description
This SQL migration file adds a new column called 'description' to the 'constraints' table in a CockroachDB database. The purpose is to allow storing additional textual information about each constraint.

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE constraints ADD COLUMN description TEXT;
#### Description
This SQL statement modifies the structure of the 'constraints' table by adding a new column named 'description' of type TEXT.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `ALTER TABLE` command is used to modify an existing table.
2. `constraints` is the name of the table being altered.
3. `ADD COLUMN` specifies that a new column is being added to the table.
4. `description` is the name of the new column.
5. `TEXT` is the data type of the new column, allowing for storage of variable-length character strings.

## Configuration
This migration file is part of a series of migrations, as indicated by the filename prefix '5_'. It is an 'up' migration, meant to be applied to update the database schema.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in this migration file. However, it's worth noting that after applying this migration, existing rows in the 'constraints' table will have NULL values in the new 'description' column unless further data manipulation is performed.
