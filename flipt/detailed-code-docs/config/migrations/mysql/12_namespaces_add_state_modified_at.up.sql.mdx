## High-level description
This SQL migration script adds a new column named `state_modified_at` to the `namespaces` table in a MySQL database. The new column is of type TIMESTAMP and is set to use the current timestamp as its default value.

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE namespaces ADD COLUMN state_modified_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;

#### Description
This SQL statement alters the structure of the `namespaces` table by adding a new column called `state_modified_at`.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `ALTER TABLE` command is used to modify the structure of an existing table.
2. `namespaces` is the name of the table being altered.
3. `ADD COLUMN` specifies that a new column is being added to the table.
4. `state_modified_at` is the name of the new column being added.
5. `TIMESTAMP` is the data type of the new column, which can store both date and time information.
6. `DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` sets the default value of the column to the current timestamp when a new row is inserted without specifying a value for this column.

## Side Effects
- This migration will modify the structure of the `namespaces` table by adding a new column.
- Existing rows in the table will have the `state_modified_at` column populated with the current timestamp at the time of migration.
- Future inserts into the `namespaces` table will automatically set the `state_modified_at` column to the current timestamp if no value is explicitly provided.

## Performance Considerations
- Depending on the size of the `namespaces` table, this migration might take some time to complete, as it needs to add the new column to all existing rows.
- After the migration, there will be a slight increase in storage requirements for the `namespaces` table due to the additional column.
