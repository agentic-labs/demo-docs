## High-level description
This SQL migration file adds a new column `default_variant_id` to the `flags` table in a MySQL database. The column is designed to reference the `id` column in the `variants` table, establishing a relationship between flags and their default variants.

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE `flags`
#### Description
This SQL command modifies the structure of the existing `flags` table by adding a new column.

#### Internal Logic
1. Targets the `flags` table for modification.
2. Adds a new column named `default_variant_id`.
3. Sets the data type of the new column to VARCHAR(255).
4. Establishes a foreign key relationship with the `variants` table.
5. Implements an ON DELETE SET NULL behavior for the foreign key.

## Side Effects
- The `flags` table structure is permanently altered.
- Existing rows in the `flags` table will have NULL values in the new `default_variant_id` column unless explicitly populated.
- Future inserts or updates to the `flags` table can now include a `default_variant_id` value.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| MySQL      | This SQL script is specifically for MySQL databases |

## Performance Considerations
- Adding a new column to an existing table with a large number of rows may temporarily lock the table and could impact performance during the migration.
- The foreign key relationship may slightly impact the performance of INSERT and UPDATE operations on the `flags` table.

## Error Handling
If the `variants` table or its `id` column does not exist, this migration will fail. Ensure that the `variants` table is properly set up before running this migration.
