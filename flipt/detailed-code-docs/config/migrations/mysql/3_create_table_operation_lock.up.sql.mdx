## High-level description
This SQL script creates a table named `operation_lock` in a MySQL database. The table is designed to manage and track locks for various operations, including versioning and time-based information for each lock.

## Symbols

### `operation_lock` table
#### Description
The `operation_lock` table is created to store information about locks on different operations. It includes fields for the operation name, version, and timestamps for when the lock was last acquired and when it will expire.

#### Internal Logic
The table is created with the following columns:
1. `operation`: A unique identifier for each operation.
2. `version`: An integer to track the version of the lock, starting at 0.
3. `last_acquired_at`: A timestamp indicating when the lock was last acquired.
4. `acquired_until`: A timestamp indicating when the lock will expire.

The `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` statement ensures that the table is only created if it doesn't already exist in the database.

#### Performance Considerations
- The `operation` column is set as the primary key, which automatically creates an index on this column. This ensures fast lookups when querying by operation name.
- The `UNIQUE` constraint on the `operation` column prevents duplicate entries for the same operation.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| MySQL | This SQL script is specifically designed for MySQL databases, utilizing MySQL-specific syntax and data types. |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| operation | VARCHAR(255) | N/A | The name or identifier of the operation, limited to 255 characters. |
| version | INTEGER | 0 | The version number of the lock. |
| last_acquired_at | TIMESTAMP(6) | CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(6) | The timestamp when the lock was last acquired, with microsecond precision. |
| acquired_until | TIMESTAMP(6) | CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(6) | The timestamp until which the lock is acquired, with microsecond precision. |

## Error Handling
This SQL script does not include explicit error handling. However, the `IF NOT EXISTS` clause prevents errors that would occur if the table already exists when trying to create it.

## Notes
1. The use of `TIMESTAMP(6)` indicates that the timestamps are stored with microsecond precision.
2. The `DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(6)` for both `last_acquired_at` and `acquired_until` means these fields will be automatically set to the current time when a new record is inserted if no value is explicitly provided.
3. This table structure allows for implementing a distributed locking mechanism, where different processes or services can acquire locks on specific operations and release them after a certain time.
