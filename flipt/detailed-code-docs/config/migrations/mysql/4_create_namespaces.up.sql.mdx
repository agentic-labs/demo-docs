## High-level description
This SQL script creates a `namespaces` table in a MySQL database and inserts a default namespace. The table is designed to store information about different namespaces, including their key, name, description, protection status, and timestamps for creation and updates.

## Symbols

### CREATE TABLE namespaces
#### Description
This SQL statement creates the `namespaces` table if it doesn't already exist. The table is designed to store information about different namespaces within the system.

#### Internal Logic
The table is created with the following columns:
1. `key`: A unique identifier for each namespace, serving as the primary key.
2. `name`: The name of the namespace.
3. `description`: A text field for describing the namespace.
4. `protected`: A boolean flag to indicate if the namespace is protected.
5. `created_at`: A timestamp for when the namespace was created.
6. `updated_at`: A timestamp for when the namespace was last updated.

Both `created_at` and `updated_at` are automatically set to the current timestamp when a record is inserted or updated.

### INSERT INTO namespaces
#### Description
This SQL statement inserts a default namespace into the `namespaces` table.

#### Internal Logic
The statement inserts a single row with the following values:
1. `key`: 'default'
2. `name`: 'Default'
3. `description`: 'Default namespace'
4. `protected`: true

The `created_at` and `updated_at` fields are not explicitly specified, so they will be automatically set to the current timestamp by the table's default values.

## Side Effects
1. If the `namespaces` table doesn't exist, it will be created in the database.
2. A default namespace will be inserted into the `namespaces` table. If the table already contains a row with the key 'default', this insertion might fail due to the unique constraint on the `key` column.

## Performance Considerations
1. The `key` column is defined as the primary key and is also marked as unique, which will automatically create an index on this column. This ensures fast lookups when querying by the namespace key.
2. The `created_at` and `updated_at` columns use the `TIMESTAMP(6)` data type, which includes microsecond precision. This level of precision might have a small impact on storage and performance compared to using a less precise timestamp.

## Error Handling
The script uses `IF NOT EXISTS` when creating the table, which prevents errors if the table already exists. However, there's no explicit error handling for the insertion of the default namespace. If the default namespace already exists, the insertion might fail due to the unique constraint on the `key` column.
