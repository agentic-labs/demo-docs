## High-level description
This SQL migration file adds a new column called 'description' to the 'constraints' table in a MySQL database. The purpose is to allow storing additional textual information about each constraint.

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE constraints ADD COLUMN description TEXT;
#### Description
This SQL statement modifies the structure of the 'constraints' table by adding a new column named 'description'.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| constraints | Table | The existing table to be altered |

#### Outputs
The 'constraints' table is modified to include a new column.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `ALTER TABLE` command is used to modify the structure of the 'constraints' table.
2. `ADD COLUMN` specifies that a new column is being added to the table.
3. The new column is named 'description'.
4. The data type of the new column is set to `TEXT`, which allows for storing large strings of variable length.

## Side Effects
- The 'constraints' table structure is permanently modified.
- Existing rows in the table will have a NULL value for the new 'description' column unless a default value is specified (which is not the case in this migration).
- Any queries or applications that interact with the 'constraints' table may need to be updated to account for the new column.

## Performance Considerations
Adding a new column to an existing table can be a relatively quick operation in MySQL, especially if the table is not very large. However, for very large tables, this operation might take some time and could potentially lock the table during the process.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| MySQL | The database management system for which this migration is written |

## Error Handling
This migration does not include explicit error handling. If an error occurs during the execution of this statement (e.g., if the 'constraints' table doesn't exist or if a column named 'description' already exists), the database management system will raise an error and roll back the transaction.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in this migration file. However, after applying this migration, it may be necessary to:
1. Update any application code that interacts with the 'constraints' table to utilize the new 'description' column.
2. Consider adding indexes on the 'description' column if it will be frequently searched.
3. Update any data insertion or update processes to include values for the new 'description' column.
