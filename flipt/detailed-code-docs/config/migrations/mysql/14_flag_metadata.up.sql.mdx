## High-level description
This SQL migration script adds a new column named `metadata` of type JSON to the `flags` table in a MySQL database. The new column is positioned after the `enabled` column.

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE flags
#### Description
This SQL command modifies the structure of the existing `flags` table by adding a new column.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `ALTER TABLE` statement is used to modify the `flags` table.
2. The `ADD COLUMN` clause specifies that a new column is being added to the table.
3. The new column is named `metadata` and has a data type of `JSON`.
4. The `AFTER enabled` clause positions the new column immediately after the `enabled` column in the table structure.

## Side Effects
- This migration will modify the structure of the `flags` table in the database.
- Existing rows in the `flags` table will have a `NULL` value in the new `metadata` column unless a default value is specified (which is not the case in this migration).
- Applications or queries that rely on the structure of the `flags` table may need to be updated to accommodate the new column.

## Performance Considerations
- Adding a new column to an existing table with a large number of rows can be a potentially time-consuming operation, depending on the size of the table and the database engine's implementation.
- The JSON data type in MySQL allows for efficient storage and querying of JSON-formatted data, but it may have different performance characteristics compared to other data types for certain operations.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| MySQL      | This SQL script is specifically for MySQL databases, as indicated by the use of the JSON data type, which is a MySQL-specific feature. |

Note: This migration script is relatively simple and straightforward, focusing on a single structural change to the `flags` table. The addition of a JSON column suggests that the application associated with this database may be introducing more flexible or complex flag configurations that can be stored in a structured format.
