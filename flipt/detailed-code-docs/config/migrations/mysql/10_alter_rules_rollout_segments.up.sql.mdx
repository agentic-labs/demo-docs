## High-level description
This SQL migration script alters the structure of the `rules` and `rollout_segments` tables in a MySQL database. It removes foreign key constraints, drops certain columns, and adds a new column `segment_operator` to both tables.

## Symbols

### Altering `rules` table
#### Description
This section modifies the `rules` table by removing a foreign key constraint, dropping a column, and adding a new column.

#### Internal Logic
1. Drops the foreign key constraint `rules_ibfk_3`.
2. Removes the `segment_key` column.
3. Adds a new column `segment_operator` of type INTEGER, which is NOT NULL and has a default value of 0.

### Altering `rollout_segments` table
#### Description
This section modifies the `rollout_segments` table by removing two foreign key constraints, dropping two columns, and adding a new column.

#### Internal Logic
1. Drops two foreign key constraints: `rollout_segments_ibfk_1` and `rollout_segments_ibfk_3`.
2. Removes the `segment_key` and `namespace_key` columns.
3. Adds a new column `segment_operator` of type INTEGER, which is NOT NULL and has a default value of 0.

## Side Effects
- The `rules` table will no longer have a foreign key relationship associated with `segment_key`.
- The `rollout_segments` table will no longer have foreign key relationships associated with `segment_key` and `namespace_key`.
- Both tables will have a new column `segment_operator` that can be used to store integer values, likely representing some form of operator for segments.
- Any existing data in the dropped columns (`segment_key` in both tables, and `namespace_key` in `rollout_segments`) will be permanently lost.

## Dependencies
This migration script is dependent on the MySQL database system.

## Error Handling
This script does not include explicit error handling. If any of the operations fail, the database system will likely roll back the transaction, leaving the tables in their original state.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in this migration script.
