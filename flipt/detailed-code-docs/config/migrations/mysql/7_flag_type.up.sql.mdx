## High-level description
This SQL migration file adds a new column named `type` to the `flags` table in a MySQL database. The new column is designed to store an integer value, with a default of 0 and a NOT NULL constraint.

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE flags ADD COLUMN `type` INTEGER DEFAULT 0 NOT NULL;
#### Description
This SQL statement modifies the structure of the existing `flags` table by adding a new column called `type`.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `ALTER TABLE` command is used to modify the structure of the `flags` table.
2. `ADD COLUMN` specifies that a new column is being added to the table.
3. The new column is named `type`.
4. The data type of the column is set to `INTEGER`.
5. `DEFAULT 0` sets the default value of the column to 0, meaning if no value is specified when inserting a new row, it will automatically be set to 0.
6. `NOT NULL` constraint ensures that this column cannot contain NULL values.

## Side Effects
- This migration will modify the structure of the `flags` table in the database.
- Existing rows in the `flags` table will have the new `type` column added with the default value of 0.
- Any applications or queries that interact with the `flags` table may need to be updated to account for the new `type` column.

## Performance Considerations
- Depending on the size of the `flags` table, this operation may take some time to complete, as it needs to update all existing rows.
- If the `flags` table is large, this migration might temporarily lock the table, potentially affecting database performance during the migration process.
