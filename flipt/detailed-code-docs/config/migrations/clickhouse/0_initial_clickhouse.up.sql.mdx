## Symbols

### `flipt_counter_analytics` Table
#### Description
This table is designed to store analytics data for feature flag evaluations. It uses the MergeTree engine, which is optimized for insert and select queries, and includes a TTL (Time To Live) clause for data retention.

#### Columns
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `timestamp` | DateTime('UTC') | The time of the event in UTC |
| `analytic_name` | String | Name of the analytic event |
| `namespace_key` | String | Key of the namespace |
| `flag_key` | String | Key of the feature flag |
| `flag_type` | Enum | Type of the flag (Variant or Boolean) |
| `reason` | Enum | Reason for the evaluation result |
| `match` | Nullable(Bool) | Whether there was a match (can be null) |
| `evaluation_value` | Nullable(String) | The evaluated value (can be null) |
| `value` | UInt32 | A numeric value associated with the event |

#### Internal Logic
1. The table uses the MergeTree engine, which is efficient for both inserts and reads.
2. Data is ordered by the `timestamp` column, which can improve query performance for time-based queries.
3. A TTL clause is set to automatically delete data older than one week, helping to manage storage and maintain relevance of the analytics data.

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| Engine | MergeTree | N/A | The table engine used for efficient data storage and retrieval |
| ORDER BY | timestamp | N/A | Specifies the primary key for data ordering |
| TTL | timestamp + INTERVAL 1 WEEK | N/A | Sets the data retention period to one week |

## Performance Considerations
1. The MergeTree engine is optimized for insert and select queries, which is suitable for analytics data.
2. Ordering by `timestamp` allows for efficient time-based queries and data management.
3. The TTL clause automatically removes old data, preventing unbounded growth of the table and maintaining query performance over time.
