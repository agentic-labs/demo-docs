## High-level description
This SQL script creates a materialized view named `flipt_counter_aggregated_analytics_mv` in ClickHouse. The view aggregates data from the `flipt_counter_analytics` table, grouping and summing the `value` column based on several dimensions.

## Code Structure
The script consists of a single SQL statement that creates a materialized view. It defines the structure and logic for aggregating data from the source table into the target table.

## Symbols

### `flipt_counter_aggregated_analytics_mv`
#### Description
This is a materialized view that aggregates data from the `flipt_counter_analytics` table. It groups the data by timestamp, analytic name, namespace key, flag key, reason, and evaluation value, and sums the `value` column.

#### Inputs
The view takes its input from the `flipt_counter_analytics` table.

#### Outputs
The view populates the `flipt_counter_aggregated_analytics` table with aggregated data.

#### Internal Logic
1. Selects columns from the `flipt_counter_analytics` table.
2. Groups the data by `timestamp`, `analytic_name`, `namespace_key`, `flag_key`, `reason`, and `evaluation_value`.
3. Sums the `value` column for each group.

## Side Effects
- Creates a new materialized view in the ClickHouse database.
- Populates the `flipt_counter_aggregated_analytics` table with aggregated data from `flipt_counter_analytics`.

## Performance Considerations
Materialized views in ClickHouse are designed for efficient querying of aggregated data. This view will automatically update the `flipt_counter_aggregated_analytics` table when new data is inserted into `flipt_counter_analytics`, which can improve query performance for aggregated analytics at the cost of some additional storage and computation during data insertion.

## Dependencies
