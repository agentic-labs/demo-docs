## High-level description
This SQL script adds a new column named `state_modified_at` of type `TIMESTAMP` to the `namespaces` table in a PostgreSQL database. This migration is likely part of a database schema update to track when the state of a namespace was last modified.

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE namespaces ADD COLUMN state_modified_at TIMESTAMP;
#### Description
This SQL statement alters the structure of the `namespaces` table by adding a new column called `state_modified_at` with a data type of `TIMESTAMP`.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `ALTER TABLE` command is used to modify an existing table structure.
2. `namespaces` is the target table being altered.
3. `ADD COLUMN` specifies that a new column is being added to the table.
4. `state_modified_at` is the name of the new column being added.
5. `TIMESTAMP` is the data type of the new column, which can store both date and time information.

## Side Effects
- This migration will modify the structure of the `namespaces` table in the database.
- Any existing rows in the `namespaces` table will have a `NULL` value for the new `state_modified_at` column unless a default value is specified (which is not the case in this migration).
- Depending on the size of the `namespaces` table and the database system's implementation, this operation may lock the table briefly during the schema modification.

## Performance Considerations
- Adding a column to an existing table is generally a fast operation in PostgreSQL, especially when no default value is specified.
- However, if the `namespaces` table is very large, this operation might take some time to complete and could potentially impact database performance during execution.

## Dependencies
This SQL script is designed for PostgreSQL databases, as indicated by the file path containing "postgres".
