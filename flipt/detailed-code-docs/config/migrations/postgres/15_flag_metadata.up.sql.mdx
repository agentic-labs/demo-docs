## High-level description
This SQL migration script adds a new column named `metadata` of type JSON to the `flags` table in a PostgreSQL database. This change allows for storing additional, flexible data associated with each flag in a structured JSON format.

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE flags ADD COLUMN metadata JSON;
#### Description
This SQL statement modifies the structure of the `flags` table by adding a new column called `metadata` with the data type JSON.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `ALTER TABLE` command is used to modify an existing table structure.
2. `flags` is the name of the table being altered.
3. `ADD COLUMN` specifies that a new column is being added to the table.
4. `metadata` is the name of the new column being added.
5. `JSON` is the data type of the new column, which allows storing JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) data.

## Side Effects
- This migration will modify the schema of the `flags` table in the database.
- Existing rows in the `flags` table will have a `NULL` value in the new `metadata` column unless a default value is specified (which is not the case in this migration).
- Applications or queries that interact with the `flags` table may need to be updated to handle the new `metadata` column.

## Performance Considerations
- Adding a new column to an existing table with a large number of rows can be a potentially time-consuming operation, depending on the database size and configuration.
- The JSON data type in PostgreSQL provides efficient storage and retrieval for JSON data, but querying and indexing JSON fields may have different performance characteristics compared to traditional column types.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| PostgreSQL | This migration is specifically for PostgreSQL databases, as it uses the PostgreSQL-specific JSON data type. |

Note: The file name suggests this is migration number 15 in a series of PostgreSQL migrations, indicating that there may be dependencies on previous migrations.
