## High-level description
This SQL migration file adds a new column called 'description' to the 'constraints' table in a PostgreSQL database. The purpose is to allow storing textual descriptions for constraints, enhancing the metadata associated with each constraint.

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE constraints ADD COLUMN description TEXT;
#### Description
This SQL statement modifies the structure of the 'constraints' table by adding a new column named 'description' of type TEXT.

#### Inputs
This SQL statement doesn't take any direct inputs. It operates on the existing 'constraints' table in the database.

#### Outputs
The execution of this statement results in a modified 'constraints' table structure with a new 'description' column.

#### Internal Logic
1. The statement targets the 'constraints' table.
2. It adds a new column named 'description'.
3. The data type of the new column is set to TEXT, which allows for storing variable-length character strings.

## Side Effects
- This migration will modify the schema of the 'constraints' table.
- Any existing rows in the 'constraints' table will have a NULL value in the new 'description' column unless a default value is specified (which is not the case in this migration).
- This change may affect any applications or queries that rely on the structure of the 'constraints' table.

## Performance Considerations
- Adding a new column to an existing table is generally a fast operation in PostgreSQL, especially when no default value is specified.
- However, for very large tables, this operation might take some time and could potentially lock the table briefly.

## Dependencies
This SQL script is designed to be run on a PostgreSQL database system.

## Configuration
This migration is likely part of a series of database migrations, as indicated by the filename prefix '8_'. It's important to run this in the correct sequence with other migrations.

## Error Handling
The SQL statement doesn't include explicit error handling. If the 'constraints' table doesn't exist or if the 'description' column already exists, the database will raise an error.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in this migration file. However, after applying this migration, it might be necessary to update application code to utilize the new 'description' column.
