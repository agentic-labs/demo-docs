## High-level description
This SQL migration script adds a new column named 'type' to the 'flags' table in a PostgreSQL database. The new column is of integer type, has a default value of 0, and is set to not allow null values.

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE flags ADD COLUMN type INTEGER DEFAULT 0 NOT NULL
#### Description
This SQL statement modifies the structure of the 'flags' table by adding a new column called 'type'.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `ALTER TABLE` command is used to modify an existing table structure.
2. `flags` is the name of the table being altered.
3. `ADD COLUMN` specifies that a new column is being added to the table.
4. `type` is the name of the new column being added.
5. `INTEGER` defines the data type of the new column as an integer.
6. `DEFAULT 0` sets the default value of the column to 0, meaning if no value is specified when inserting a new row, it will automatically be set to 0.
7. `NOT NULL` constraint ensures that this column cannot contain null values.

## Side Effects
- This migration will modify the structure of the 'flags' table in the database.
- All existing rows in the 'flags' table will have the new 'type' column added with a value of 0.
- Future insertions into the 'flags' table will require a value for the 'type' column (or will use the default value of 0).

## Performance Considerations
- Depending on the size of the 'flags' table, this operation might take some time to complete, as it needs to update all existing rows.
- If there are any indexes on the 'flags' table, they may need to be rebuilt after this operation.
