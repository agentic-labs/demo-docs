title: "1_variants_unique_per_flag.up.sql"
---

## High-level description
This SQL script modifies the `variants` table in a PostgreSQL database. It removes an existing unique constraint on the `key` column and adds a new composite unique constraint on the `flag_key` and `key` columns together.

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE variants DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS variants_key_key;
#### Description
This SQL statement removes an existing unique constraint named `variants_key_key` from the `variants` table if it exists.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the statement won't throw an error if the constraint doesn't exist.
2. This operation allows duplicate values in the `key` column, which was previously enforced to be unique.

### ALTER TABLE variants ADD UNIQUE(flag_key, key);
#### Description
This SQL statement adds a new composite unique constraint to the `variants` table, ensuring that the combination of `flag_key` and `key` is unique.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a unique index on the `flag_key` and `key` columns together.
2. Enforces that no two rows in the `variants` table can have the same combination of `flag_key` and `key` values.

## Side Effects
- Removes the uniqueness requirement for the `key` column alone.
- Enforces uniqueness for the combination of `flag_key` and `key`.
- May cause an error if there are existing duplicate combinations of `flag_key` and `key` in the table.

## Performance Considerations
- Adding a new unique constraint will create an index, which may slightly impact insert and update performance but will improve query performance when searching by `flag_key` and `key` together.
- Removing the old constraint and adding a new one may take some time on large tables.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| PostgreSQL | This SQL script is specific to PostgreSQL database systems |

## Error Handling
The `IF EXISTS` clause in the first statement prevents errors if the constraint doesn't exist. However, the second statement may fail if there are existing duplicate combinations of `flag_key` and `key`.
