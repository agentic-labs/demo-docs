title: "4_create_table_authentications.up.sql"
---

## High-level description
This SQL script creates a table named `authentications` in a PostgreSQL database. The table is designed to store authentication-related information, including client tokens, authentication methods, and associated metadata. It also creates a unique index on the `hashed_client_token` column for efficient lookups.

## Code Structure
The script consists of two main SQL statements:
1. A `CREATE TABLE` statement to define the `authentications` table structure.
2. A `CREATE UNIQUE INDEX` statement to create an index on the `hashed_client_token` column.

## Symbols

### CREATE TABLE authentications
#### Description
This SQL statement creates the `authentications` table with various columns to store authentication-related data.

#### Internal Logic
The table is created with the following columns:
- `id`: A unique identifier for each authentication record.
- `hashed_client_token`: A hashed version of the client token used for authentication.
- `method`: An integer representing the authentication method used.
- `metadata`: Additional information about the authentication in text format.
- `expires_at`: A timestamp indicating when the authentication expires.
- `created_at`: A timestamp for when the record was created.
- `updated_at`: A timestamp for when the record was last updated.

The `IF NOT EXISTS` clause ensures that the table is only created if it doesn't already exist in the database.

### CREATE UNIQUE INDEX hashed_client_token_authentications_index
#### Description
This SQL statement creates a unique index on the `hashed_client_token` column of the `authentications` table.

#### Internal Logic
The index is created to improve query performance when searching for records based on the `hashed_client_token`. The `UNIQUE` constraint ensures that no duplicate `hashed_client_token` values can exist in the table.

## Performance Considerations
1. The `id` and `hashed_client_token` columns are defined as `UNIQUE`, which automatically creates indexes on these columns. This improves lookup performance for queries using these fields.
2. The additional unique index on `hashed_client_token` further optimizes queries that search by this column, which is likely a common operation in authentication systems.

## Dependencies
This script is designed for PostgreSQL databases, as indicated by the filename and the SQL syntax used.

## Configuration
The table structure defines some default values and constraints:
| Column | Type | Default | Constraint |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:-----------|
| id | VARCHAR(255) | N/A | PRIMARY KEY, UNIQUE, NOT NULL |
| hashed_client_token | VARCHAR(255) | N/A | UNIQUE, NOT NULL |
| method | INTEGER | 0 | NOT NULL |
| created_at | TIMESTAMP | CURRENT_TIMESTAMP | NOT NULL |
| updated_at | TIMESTAMP | CURRENT_TIMESTAMP | NOT NULL |

These configurations ensure data integrity and provide sensible defaults for certain fields.
