## High-level description
This directory contains PostgreSQL migration scripts for a feature flag management system. The scripts create and modify tables to support various features such as namespaces, rollouts, segments, variants, and authentication. These migrations evolve the database schema to accommodate new functionality and improve existing features.

## What does it do?
The migration scripts in this directory perform the following main tasks:

1. Create initial tables for flags, segments, variants, constraints, rules, and distributions.
2. Add support for namespaces, allowing for better organization of feature flags.
3. Implement rollout functionality with thresholds and segment-based rollouts.
4. Add support for authentication and operation locking.
5. Modify existing tables to support new features like default variants, flag metadata, and flag types.
6. Improve data integrity and relationships between tables.
7. Add columns for tracking state changes and descriptions.

These migrations collectively build and refine a database schema that supports a comprehensive feature flag management system with advanced capabilities like gradual rollouts, segmentation, and multi-tenancy through namespaces.

## Key Files
1. `0_initial.up.sql`: Creates the initial database schema with core tables.
2. `6_create_namespaces.up.sql`: Introduces the concept of namespaces.
3. `7_namespaces_relationships.up.sql`: Establishes relationships between namespaces and other tables.
4. `10_rollouts.up.sql`: Adds support for feature rollouts.
5. `11_segment_anding_tables.up.sql`: Implements many-to-many relationships for segments.
4. `4_create_table_authentications.up.sql`: Creates a table for storing authentication information.
5. `5_create_table_operation_lock.up.sql`: Implements an operation locking mechanism.

These files represent significant changes to the database schema and introduce key features of the system.

## Dependencies
The migration scripts are designed for PostgreSQL databases and utilize PostgreSQL-specific features such as:

- JSONB data type for storing JSON data
- Timestamp operations
- Cascading deletes for referential integrity

## Configuration
The migration scripts use the following configuration patterns:

1. Timestamps:
   - `created_at` and `updated_at` columns are commonly used with `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` as the default value.
2. Foreign key relationships:
   - Often use `ON DELETE CASCADE` for maintaining referential integrity.
3. Default values:
   - Integer columns often have a default value of 0.
   - Boolean columns typically default to FALSE.

These configurations ensure consistent behavior across tables and provide sensible defaults for new records.

In conclusion, this directory contains a comprehensive set of PostgreSQL migration scripts that build and evolve a database schema for a feature flag management system. The migrations support advanced features like namespaces, rollouts, and segmentation while maintaining data integrity and performance considerations.
