title: "migrations.go"

## High-level description
This code defines a package named `migrations` that embeds all files in the current directory into a file system variable named `FS`. This allows for easy access to migration files or other embedded resources within the application.

## Symbols

### FS
#### Description
`FS` is a variable of type `embed.FS` (embedded file system) that contains all files from the current directory. The `//go:embed *` directive instructs the Go compiler to include all files in the package's directory into the `FS` variable.

#### Inputs
This symbol doesn't have explicit inputs as it's a variable declaration.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| FS | embed.FS | An embedded file system containing all files from the current directory |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| embed | Provides the `embed.FS` type for embedding files into the Go binary |

## Notes
1. The `embed` package is part of Go's standard library since Go 1.16, allowing for easy file embedding at compile-time.
2. The `//go:embed *` directive is a special comment recognized by the Go compiler. It tells the compiler to include all files from the current directory into the `FS` variable.
3. This approach is useful for bundling migration files, templates, or other static resources directly into the compiled binary, making deployment and distribution easier.
4. The embedded files can be accessed at runtime using the methods provided by the `embed.FS` type, such as `Open()`, `ReadDir()`, or `ReadFile()`.

This code provides a convenient way to access migration files or other resources within the application without needing to manage separate file distributions or worry about file paths at runtime.
