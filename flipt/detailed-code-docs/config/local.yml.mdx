## Commented Sections
The configuration file includes several commented-out sections that provide additional configuration options:

1. `version`: Commented out, but would specify the configuration version.

2. `authentication`: A commented section that would configure authentication settings, including:
   - Whether authentication is required
   - Session settings (domain and secure flag)
   - Token-based authentication method with bootstrap and cleanup options

3. `server`: A commented section that would configure server settings, including:
   - Protocol (http)
   - Host (0.0.0.0)
   - HTTPS port (443)
   - HTTP port (8080)
   - gRPC port (9000)

These commented sections provide examples of additional configuration options that could be uncommented and adjusted as needed for different environments or requirements.

## Dependencies
