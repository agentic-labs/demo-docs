## High-level description
This directory contains configuration files and database migration scripts for Flipt, an open-source feature flag and experimentation platform. It includes default and environment-specific configurations, JSON schema definitions, and database migration scripts for various database systems.

## What does it do?
The configuration files in this directory define the behavior and settings of the Flipt application for different environments (default, local, and production). They control aspects such as logging, server settings, database connections, authentication, caching, and more. 

The database migration scripts set up and evolve the database schema for Flipt across different database platforms (ClickHouse, CockroachDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite3). These migrations create and modify tables to support core functionality like flags, segments, variants, constraints, rules, distributions, and authentication.

Additionally, there's a test file that validates the configuration schema using both CUE and JSON Schema, ensuring that the default configuration adheres to the defined schemas.

## Key Files
1. `default.yml`: Contains the default configuration for Flipt, with all settings commented out as a template.
2. `local.yml`: Defines settings for a local development environment, including debug logging and CORS configuration.
3. `production.yml`: Specifies production-ready settings, including HTTPS setup and PostgreSQL database connection.
4. `flipt.schema.json`: JSON schema defining the structure and validation rules for Flipt's configuration.
5. `migrations/`: Directory containing database migration scripts for various database systems.
6. `schema_test.go`: Unit tests for validating the configuration schema using CUE and JSON Schema.

## Dependencies
The configuration and migration scripts rely on several key dependencies:

1. Flipt: The main application that uses these configurations and database schemas.
2. Database systems: PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite3, CockroachDB, and ClickHouse.
3. YAML and JSON parsers: For reading and validating configuration files.
4. CUE and JSON Schema: For schema validation in the test file.
5. SSL/TLS: For secure HTTPS communication in production.
6. gRPC: For efficient RPC communication.

## Configuration
The configuration files (`default.yml`, `local.yml`, and `production.yml`) provide a wide range of configurable options, including:

1. Logging settings (level, file, encoding)
2. UI settings (enabled, default theme)
3. CORS configuration
4. Caching settings (backend, TTL)
5. Server configuration (protocol, ports, SSL certificates)
6. Database connection settings
7. Authentication and authorization settings
8. Tracing and diagnostics options

The `flipt.schema.json` file defines the structure and validation rules for these configuration options, ensuring consistency and correctness across different environments.

In summary, this directory provides a comprehensive set of configuration options and database migration scripts that allow Flipt to be customized and deployed across various environments and database systems, while maintaining consistency and adhering to defined schemas.
