## High-level description
This YAML file, named `.flipt.yml`, is a configuration file for Flipt, a feature flag management system. It defines the version of the configuration and specifies patterns for including and excluding feature flag definition files within a project.

## Symbols

### `version`

## Internal Logic
The configuration file uses glob patterns to define which files should be included or excluded when Flipt searches for feature flag definitions:

1. It includes all files ending with `features.yml` or `features.yaml` in any directory.
2. It also includes files with `.features.yml` or `.features.yaml` extensions.
3. It explicitly excludes any files or directories within the `internal/` directory.

This configuration allows for flexible organization of feature flag definitions across the project while avoiding specific internal directories.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Flipt | Feature flag management system that uses this configuration file |

Note: While not explicitly mentioned in the file, Flipt is the system that would interpret and use this configuration.
