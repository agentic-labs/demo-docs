title: "release-clients.yml"
---

## High-level description
This GitHub Actions workflow `release-clients.yml` is designed to trigger updates to various Flipt GRPC client libraries (Go, Ruby, and .NET) based on either a successful completion of the `Release` workflow or a manual dispatch event. It uses a GitHub App token for authentication and triggers the `proto-upgrade.yml` workflow in the respective client repositories.

## Code Structure
The workflow consists of a single job `release_client` that runs on Ubuntu. It first generates a GitHub App token. Then, depending on the trigger event (`workflow_dispatch` or successful `workflow_run`), it extracts the release tag and triggers the `proto-upgrade.yml` workflow in the Go, Ruby, and .NET client repositories.

## References
- `proto-upgrade.yml`: This workflow is triggered in the client repositories to perform the actual updates.

## Symbols
### `release-clients.yml`
#### Description
This workflow defines the steps to trigger updates to GRPC clients when a new release is created or manually dispatched.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| tag | string | (Optional, for `workflow_dispatch`) The Flipt release version tag to use for the update. |

#### Internal Logic
1. **Generate Token:**
   - Uses the `tibdex/github-app-token@v2` action to generate a GitHub App token for authentication.
   - Requires the following secrets:
     - `FLIPT_RELEASE_BOT_APP_ID`
     - `FLIPT_RELEASE_BOT_APP_PEM`
     - `FLIPT_RELEASE_BOT_INSTALLATION_ID`

2. **Trigger Workflow (Dispatch):**
   - This step runs only if the workflow was triggered manually using `workflow_dispatch`.
   - Extracts the `tag` input provided during dispatch.
   - Uses the generated GitHub App token to trigger the `proto-upgrade.yml` workflow in the Go, Ruby, and .NET client repositories, passing the `tag` as an input.

3. **Trigger Workflow (Release):**
   - This step runs only if the workflow was triggered by the successful completion of the `Release` workflow.
   - Extracts the release tag from the `GITHUB_REF_NAME` environment variable.
   - Uses the generated GitHub App token to trigger the `proto-upgrade.yml` workflow in the Go, Ruby, and .NET client repositories, passing the extracted tag as an input.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| tibdex/github-app-token@v2 | GitHub Action to generate a GitHub App token for authentication. |

## Side Effects
- Triggers the `proto-upgrade.yml` workflow in the `flipt-io/flipt-grpc-go`, `flipt-io/flipt-grpc-ruby`, and `flipt-io/flipt-grpc-dotnet` repositories.

## Error Handling
This workflow does not implement specific error handling. Any failures in the steps will result in the workflow failing.
