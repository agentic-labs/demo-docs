## High-level description
This code defines a GitHub Actions workflow named "Benchmarks" that automatically runs Go benchmarks for the project when code is pushed to the `main` branch, a pull request is created, or the workflow is manually dispatched. The benchmarks are executed against a SQLite database and measure code performance.

## Code Structure
The code defines a single job named `benchmark` which runs on the latest Ubuntu environment. The job consists of three steps: checking out the code, setting up the Go environment, and running the benchmarks.

## Symbols
### `name: Benchmarks`
#### Description
Defines the name of the workflow as "Benchmarks". This name will be displayed in the GitHub Actions interface.

### `on:`
#### Description
Specifies the events that trigger the workflow.

#### Internal Logic
* `push`: Triggers the workflow on push events to the specified branches.
    * `branches`: Specifies the branches that trigger the workflow on push events. In this case, it's only the `main` branch.
* `pull_request`: Triggers the workflow on pull request events.
* `workflow_dispatch`: Allows manually triggering the workflow from the GitHub Actions interface.

### `env:`
#### Description
Defines environment variables available to all jobs in the workflow.

#### Internal Logic
* `GO_VERSION: "1.21"`: Sets the Go version to 1.21 for the workflow.

### `jobs:`
#### Description
Defines a collection of jobs that run in parallel.

### `benchmark:`
#### Description
Defines a job named "benchmark" that runs the Go benchmarks.

#### Internal Logic
* `name: Benchmark SQLite`: Sets the name of the job to "Benchmark SQLite".
* `runs-on: ubuntu-latest`: Specifies that the job runs on the latest Ubuntu virtual environment.
* `steps:`: Defines a sequence of steps that are executed in order.
    * `uses: actions/checkout@v4`: Checks out the repository's code.
    * `uses: actions/setup-go@v5`: Sets up the Go environment.
        * `with:`: Provides input parameters to the action.
            * `go-version: ${{ env.GO_VERSION }}`: Uses the Go version specified in the `GO_VERSION` environment variable.
            * `check-latest: true`: Checks if the specified Go version is the latest available.
            * `cache: true`: Enables caching of Go dependencies to speed up subsequent runs.
    * `name: Run Benchmarks`: Defines a step named "Run Benchmarks".
        * `run: go test -run XXX -bench . -benchtime 5s -benchmem -short ./...`: Executes the Go benchmarks.
            * `go test`: Runs the Go testing tool.
            * `-run XXX`: Skips tests that match the regular expression "XXX". This is likely a placeholder and should be replaced with a valid regular expression if needed.
            * `-bench .`: Runs all benchmarks.
            * `-benchtime 5s`: Runs each benchmark for 5 seconds.
            * `-benchmem`: Prints memory allocation statistics for each benchmark.
            * `-short`: Reduces the time for long-running tests.
            * `./...`: Specifies the packages to test. In this case, it includes all packages under the current directory and its subdirectories.
