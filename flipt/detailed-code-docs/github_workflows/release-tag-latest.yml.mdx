title: "release-tag-latest.yml"
---

## High-level description
This GitHub Actions workflow defines a process to tag the latest release of the Flipt application on Docker Hub and GitHub Container Registry. It pulls a specific release version of the Flipt Docker image from different repositories, retags it as "latest", and pushes it back to the respective repositories.

## References
- This workflow references the `mage release:latest` command, which is defined in the `build/magefile.go` file. This command likely handles the logic for determining the latest release version.

### `Tag Latest Release`
#### Description
This workflow is triggered manually and takes a Flipt release version as input. It then pulls the corresponding Docker images from various repositories, retags them as "latest", and pushes them back to their respective repositories.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| tag | string | The Flipt release version to tag as "latest". |

#### Internal Logic
1. **Checkout Code:** Checks out the repository code.
2. **Setup Go:** Sets up the Go environment with the specified version.
3. **Cache Dependencies:** Caches Go tools and dependencies to speed up subsequent runs.
4. **Install Skopeo:** Installs the Skopeo tool, used for copying and tagging Docker images.
5. **Login to Docker Hub and GHCR:** Logs in to Docker Hub and GitHub Container Registry using stored credentials.
6. **Install Mage:** Installs the Mage build tool.
7. **Tag and Push Latest:** 
    - Retrieves the latest release version using the `mage release:latest` command.
    - If the input tag matches the latest release version:
        - Pulls the Docker images for the specified tag from `flipt/flipt`, `markphelps/flipt`, and `ghcr.io/flipt-io/flipt`.
        - Uses Skopeo to copy each image and retag it as "latest".
        - Pushes the retagged "latest" images back to their respective repositories.

## Error Handling
This workflow does not implement specific error handling beyond the default behavior of the used actions. Any errors during the execution of a step will cause the workflow to fail.
