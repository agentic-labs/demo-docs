title: "test.yml"
---

## High-level description
This code defines a GitHub Actions workflow named "Unit Tests" that runs various unit tests for the project. It includes tests for Go code, UI components, and database migrations. The workflow is triggered on push events to the main branch, pull requests, or manually via workflow dispatch.

## Code Structure
The code defines a single workflow with multiple jobs. Each job represents a different test suite (Go, UI, Migration). The jobs run concurrently and use various actions for setup, testing, and reporting.

## References
This workflow references the following secrets:
- `DAGGER_CLOUD_TOKEN`: Used for authenticating with Dagger CI.
- `CODECOV_TOKEN`: Used for uploading code coverage reports to Codecov.

## Symbols
### `name`
#### Description
Specifies the name of the workflow, displayed in the GitHub Actions UI.

#### Inputs
N/A

#### Outputs
N/A

#### Internal Logic
N/A

### `on`
#### Description
Defines the events that trigger the workflow.

#### Inputs
N/A

#### Outputs
N/A

#### Internal Logic
- `push`: Triggers the workflow on push events to branches matching the specified pattern (`main`).
- `pull_request`: Triggers the workflow on pull requests.
- `workflow_dispatch`: Allows manually triggering the workflow.

### `env`
#### Description
Defines environment variables available to all jobs in the workflow.

#### Inputs
N/A

#### Outputs
N/A

#### Internal Logic
- `GO_VERSION`: Specifies the Go version to use (1.22).
- `DAGGER_VERSION`: Specifies the Dagger CLI version to use (0.12.3).

### `concurrency`
#### Description
Configures concurrent workflow run behavior.

#### Inputs
N/A

#### Outputs
N/A

#### Internal Logic
- `group`: Groups concurrent runs by workflow and branch/tag, canceling older runs if a newer one starts.
- `cancel-in-progress`: Cancels any in-progress runs in the same group when a new run starts.

### `jobs`
#### Description
Defines the individual jobs that run within the workflow.

#### Inputs
N/A

#### Outputs
N/A

#### Internal Logic
- Each job has a unique name and runs on a specific runner environment (e.g., `ubuntu-latest`).
- Jobs use various actions to perform tasks like checking out code, setting up dependencies, running tests, and uploading artifacts.

### `test`
#### Description
This job runs the Go unit tests using Dagger.

#### Inputs
N/A

#### Outputs
N/A

#### Internal Logic
- Checks out the code.
- Frees up disk space.
- Runs unit tests using Dagger with specified arguments and cloud token.
- Uploads code coverage results to Codecov.

### `test-darwin`
#### Description
This job runs the Go unit tests on macOS, specifically targeting SQLite.

#### Inputs
N/A

#### Outputs
N/A

#### Internal Logic
- Checks out the code.
- Sets up the Go environment.
- Runs Go tests with specific flags for SQLite and test execution.

### `ui`
#### Description
This job runs the UI component tests using npm.

#### Inputs
N/A

#### Outputs
N/A

#### Internal Logic
- Checks out the code.
- Sets up the Node.js environment.
- Installs dependencies using npm.
- Runs UI tests using npm.

### `migration`
#### Description
This job runs database migration tests using Dagger.

#### Inputs
N/A

#### Outputs
N/A

#### Internal Logic
- Checks out the code.
- Frees up disk space.
- Runs migration tests using Dagger with specified arguments and cloud token.

## Dependencies
- `actions/checkout`: Used to check out the repository's code.
- `jlumbroso/free-disk-space`: Used to free up disk space on the runner.
- `dagger/dagger-for-github`: Used to run tests using Dagger CI.
- `codecov/codecov-action`: Used to upload code coverage reports to Codecov.
- `actions/setup-go`: Used to set up the Go environment.
- `actions/setup-node`: Used to set up the Node.js environment.

## Configuration
This workflow uses secrets for authentication and configuration:
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| `DAGGER_CLOUD_TOKEN` | `secret` | N/A | Token for authenticating with Dagger CI. |
| `CODECOV_TOKEN` | `secret` | N/A | Token for uploading code coverage reports to Codecov. |

## Error Handling
The workflow relies on the error handling mechanisms of the individual actions used. For example, the `codecov/codecov-action` has a `fail_ci_if_error` flag that controls whether to fail the workflow if an error occurs during coverage upload.

## Logging
Logging is handled by the individual actions used in the workflow. Each action typically outputs logs to the GitHub Actions console.
