title: "post-release.yml"
---

## High-level description
This GitHub Actions workflow automates post-release tasks for the Flipt project. It triggers upon successful completion of the "Release" workflow or when manually dispatched. Its primary function is to initiate two downstream workflows: "deploy.yml" for `flipt-io/try.flipt.io` and "update.yml" for `flipt-io/helm-charts`.

## Code Structure
The workflow defines a single job "post_release" which runs on the latest Ubuntu environment. It checks for a successful "Release" workflow run or a manual trigger. Upon either condition, it generates a GitHub App token and uses it to trigger the "deploy.yml" and "update.yml" workflows in the specified repositories.

## Symbols
### `on`
#### Description
This section defines the events that trigger the workflow.

#### Internal Logic
- **`workflow_run`**: Triggers when a workflow run completes.
    - **`workflows`**: Specifies the target workflow, in this case, "Release".
    - **`types`**: Specifies the target workflow run status, in this case, "completed".
- **`workflow_dispatch`**: Allows manual triggering of the workflow.

### `name`
#### Description
Specifies the workflow's name as it appears in the GitHub Actions interface.

### `jobs`
#### Description
This section defines the jobs that run within the workflow.

### `post_release`
#### Description
This is the primary job of the workflow, responsible for triggering post-release tasks.

#### Internal Logic
- **`runs-on`**: Specifies the runner environment, in this case, the latest Ubuntu version.
- **`if`**: Conditionally runs the job based on the success of the "Release" workflow or manual triggering.
- **`steps`**: Defines a sequence of actions performed by the job.
    - **`generate_token`**: Generates a GitHub App token using the provided credentials.
    - **`Trigger Post Release Workflows`**: Uses the generated token to trigger the "deploy.yml" and "update.yml" workflows in their respective repositories.

### `steps`
#### Description
This section defines a sequence of actions performed by the job.

### `generate_token`
#### Description
This step generates a GitHub App token for authentication.

#### Internal Logic
- Uses the `tibdex/github-app-token@v2` action to generate a token.
- Requires the following secrets:
    - `FLIPT_RELEASE_BOT_APP_ID`: GitHub App ID.
    - `FLIPT_RELEASE_BOT_APP_PEM`: GitHub App private key.
    - `FLIPT_RELEASE_BOT_INSTALLATION_ID`: GitHub App installation ID.

### `Trigger Post Release Workflows`
#### Description
This step triggers the downstream workflows.

#### Internal Logic
- Uses the `gh` CLI tool to trigger workflows.
- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Uses the token generated in the previous step.
- Triggers the following workflows:
    - `deploy.yml` in the `flipt-io/try.flipt.io` repository.
    - `update.yml` in the `flipt-io/helm-charts` repository.
