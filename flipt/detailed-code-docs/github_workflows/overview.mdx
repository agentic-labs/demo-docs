## High-level description
This directory contains GitHub Actions workflows that automate various processes for the Flipt project, including testing, building, releasing, and maintaining the codebase. These workflows cover a wide range of tasks such as running unit tests, linting code, building and releasing binaries, updating client libraries, and managing protocol buffer definitions.

## What does it do?
The workflows in this directory automate several key processes:

1. Testing: Run unit tests for Go code, UI components, and database migrations.
2. Linting: Check code quality and style for Go, Markdown, and UI code.
3. Building: Compile the application for different platforms (Linux and macOS).
4. Releasing: Create and publish releases, including Docker images and binaries.
5. Client Library Updates: Trigger updates to GRPC client libraries when new releases are made.
6. Protocol Buffer Management: Lint, check for breaking changes, and push updates to protocol buffer definitions.
7. Continuous Integration: Run integration tests and benchmarks.
8. Development Environment: Build and push development container images.
9. Documentation: Automate the creation of documentation issues for new features or changes.

These workflows ensure code quality, maintain consistency across the project, and streamline the development and release processes.

## Entry points
The main entry points for these workflows are:

1. `test.yml`: Runs unit tests for Go code, UI components, and database migrations.
2. `lint.yml`: Performs linting checks on Go, Markdown, and UI code.
3. `release.yml`: Handles the release process, including building binaries and publishing Docker images.
4. `integration-test.yml`: Runs integration tests for CLI, core components, and UI.
5. `proto.yml`: Manages protocol buffer definitions, including linting and breaking change detection.

These workflows are typically triggered by events such as pushes to the main branch, pull requests, or manual dispatch. Some workflows, like `release.yml`, are triggered by specific events like pushing a new tag.

## Key Files
1. `benchmark.yml`: Runs performance benchmarks for the project.
2. `devcontainer.yml`: Builds and pushes development container images.
3. `label.yml`: Automates the creation of documentation issues based on PR labels.
4. `nightly.yml`: Handles nightly builds and security scans.
5. `post-release.yml`: Triggers downstream workflows after a successful release.
6. `release-clients.yml`: Updates GRPC client libraries after a new release.
7. `release-tag-latest.yml`: Tags the latest release on Docker registries.
8. `snapshot.yml`: Creates snapshot builds for testing purposes.

## Dependencies
The workflows in this directory rely on several external actions and tools:

1. GitHub Actions: Various official actions like `actions/checkout`, `actions/setup-go`, and `actions/cache`.
2. Docker: Actions for Docker operations, including `docker/setup-qemu-action` and `docker/setup-buildx-action`.
3. GoReleaser: Used for building and releasing Go applications.
4. Dagger: A portable devkit for CI/CD pipelines.
5. Buf: Tools for working with Protocol Buffers.
6. Node.js: Used for UI-related tasks.
7. Mage: A build tool for Go projects.
8. Codecov: For uploading and tracking code coverage.
9. StackHawk: For security scanning.

## Configuration
Many of the workflows use environment variables and secrets for configuration:

1. `GO_VERSION`: Specifies the Go version to use (typically set to 1.22).
2. `DAGGER_VERSION`: Specifies the Dagger CLI version.
3. `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Used for GitHub API authentication.
4. `DOCKER_USERNAME` and `DOCKER_TOKEN`: For Docker Hub authentication.
5. `GORELEASER_KEY`: For signing releases with GoReleaser Pro.
6. `ANALYTICS_WRITE_KEY` and `ANALYTICS_WRITE_ENDPOINT`: For sending analytics data.
7. `QUILL_SIGN_P12` and `QUILL_SIGN_PASSWORD`: For signing macOS binaries.
8. `FLIPT_RELEASE_BOT_APP_ID`, `FLIPT_RELEASE_BOT_APP_PEM`, and `FLIPT_RELEASE_BOT_INSTALLATION_ID`: For GitHub App authentication.
9. `SLACK_WEBHOOK` and `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_ID`/`DISCORD_WEBHOOK_TOKEN`: For sending notifications.

These configurations allow the workflows to interact with various services and perform authenticated operations throughout the CI/CD process.
