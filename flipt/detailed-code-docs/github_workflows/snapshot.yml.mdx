title: "snapshot.yml"
---

## High-level description
This GitHub Actions workflow builds and releases snapshot builds of the Flipt application. It builds binaries for Linux and macOS, packages them using GoReleaser, and publishes them as artifacts.

## Code Structure
The workflow consists of two main jobs: `snapshot-build` and `snapshot-release`. The `snapshot-build` job builds the Flipt binaries for different operating systems and uploads them as artifacts. The `snapshot-release` job downloads the artifacts, uses GoReleaser to create a snapshot release, and uploads the release artifacts.

## References
This workflow references the following secrets:
- `FLIPT_FORMBRICKS_ENVIRONMENT_ID`
- `GORELEASER_KEY`
- `GITHUB_TOKEN`
- `ANALYTICS_WRITE_KEY`
- `ANALYTICS_WRITE_ENDPOINT`
- `QUILL_SIGN_P12`
- `QUILL_SIGN_PASSWORD`

## Symbols
### `name: Release (Snapshot)`
#### Description
This line defines the name of the workflow as "Release (Snapshot)".

### `on: workflow_dispatch:`
#### Description
This section specifies that the workflow can be triggered manually using the "workflow_dispatch" event.

### `env: GO_VERSION: "1.22"`
#### Description
This section defines an environment variable `GO_VERSION` and sets it to "1.22", which specifies the Go version to be used in the workflow.

### `jobs:`
#### Description
This section defines the jobs that will be executed in the workflow.

### `snapshot-build:`
#### Description
This job builds the Flipt binaries for different operating systems.
#### Internal Logic
- It checks out the repository.
- Sets up Go using the specified version.
- Sets up Node.js.
- Installs GCC for arm64 on Linux.
- Installs Quill on macOS.
- Installs Mage.
- Runs `mage prep` to prepare the build.
- Uses GoReleaser to build snapshot binaries for Linux and macOS.
- Uploads the built binaries as artifacts.

### `snapshot-release:`
#### Description
This job creates a snapshot release using GoReleaser.
#### Internal Logic
- It checks out the repository.
- Sets up Go.
- Sets up QEMU for cross-platform emulation.
- Sets up Buildx for building multi-platform Docker images.
- Downloads the snapshot artifacts built in the previous job.
- Installs Syft for generating SBOMs.
- Uses GoReleaser to create a snapshot release.
- Uploads the release artifacts.

## Dependencies
This workflow uses the following external actions:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| actions/checkout@v4 | Checks out the repository. |
| actions/setup-go@v5 | Sets up the Go environment. |
| actions/cache@v4 | Caches dependencies to speed up builds. |
| actions/setup-node@v4 | Sets up the Node.js environment. |
| magefile/mage-action@v3 | Installs and runs Mage. |
| goreleaser/goreleaser-action@v6 | Runs GoReleaser to build and release the application. |
| actions/upload-artifact@v4 | Uploads artifacts. |
| actions/download-artifact@v4 | Downloads artifacts. |
| docker/setup-qemu-action@v3 | Sets up QEMU for cross-platform emulation. |
| docker/setup-buildx-action@v3 | Sets up Buildx for building multi-platform Docker images. |

## Configuration
This workflow uses secrets for sensitive information like API keys and passwords. These secrets are defined in the GitHub repository settings.

## Error Handling
This workflow uses the `fail-fast: false` strategy for the `snapshot-build` job, which means that if one build fails, the others will continue to run. This allows for identifying issues on specific platforms without interrupting the entire workflow.

## Logging
This workflow uses the default logging mechanisms provided by GitHub Actions. Each step in the workflow logs its output, which can be viewed in the GitHub Actions workflow run logs.
