title: "label.yml"

## High-level description
This GitHub Actions workflow automates the creation of documentation issues in a separate "docs" repository when a pull request in the main repository is labeled with "needs docs". This ensures that new features or changes are properly documented.

## Code Structure
The workflow is triggered when a pull request is labeled. It then checks if the label is "needs docs". If it is, the workflow generates a GitHub App token, checks for existing documentation issues with the same title as the pull request, and if none exist, creates a new issue in the "docs" repository with a link to the pull request.

## References
This workflow references the following:
- `secrets.FLIPT_RELEASE_BOT_APP_ID`: GitHub App ID used for authentication.
- `secrets.FLIPT_RELEASE_BOT_APP_PEM`: Private key for the GitHub App.
- `secrets.FLIPT_RELEASE_BOT_INSTALLATION_ID`: Installation ID of the GitHub App.

## Symbols
### `label.yml`
#### Description
This YAML file defines a GitHub Actions workflow named "Label PRs" that automates documentation issue creation.

#### Inputs
This workflow is triggered by the `pull_request` event, specifically when a pull request is `labeled`. It only runs on the `main` branch.

#### Outputs
This workflow doesn't have any direct outputs. However, it creates a new issue in the "docs" repository as a side effect.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Check Label:** The workflow first checks if the applied label is "needs docs".
2. **Generate Token:** If the label matches, it uses the `tibdex/github-app-token@v2` action to generate a GitHub App token for authentication.
3. **Check Existing Issues:** It then uses the `gh` CLI tool to search for existing issues in the "docs" repository with a title matching "Document: [Pull Request Title]".
4. **Create Issue:** If no matching issue is found, it creates a new issue in the "docs" repository. The issue title includes the pull request title, and the body contains a link to the pull request.

## Side Effects
- Creates a new issue in the "docs" repository when a pull request in the main repository is labeled with "needs docs" and no corresponding issue exists.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `actions/checkout@v4` | Checks out the repository's code. |
| `tibdex/github-app-token@v2` | Generates a GitHub App token for authentication. |
| `jq` | Command-line JSON processor used for parsing JSON data. |
| `gh` | GitHub CLI tool for interacting with GitHub from the command line. |

## Error Handling
This workflow doesn't implement specific error handling. If any of the steps fail, the workflow run will fail.

## Logging
This workflow uses the default GitHub Actions logging mechanism. Each step's output is logged and visible in the workflow run details.
