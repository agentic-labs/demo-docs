title: "lint.yml"
---

## High-level description
This code defines a GitHub Actions workflow named "Lint" that performs various linting tasks on the codebase, including Go code linting, Markdown linting, UI linting, and ensuring `go mod tidy` is run. It is triggered on push events to the 'main' branch, on pull requests, or manually via workflow dispatch.

## Code Structure
The code defines a single workflow "Lint" with four jobs: "go-lint", "markdown-lint", "ui-lint", and "go-mod-tidy". Each job runs on the latest Ubuntu environment and performs linting using specific tools and configurations.

## Symbols
### `name: Lint`
#### Description
Defines the name of the workflow as "Lint".

### `on:`
#### Description
Specifies the events that trigger the workflow.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `push` | event | Triggers the workflow on push events to branches matching the specified pattern. |
| `branches` | string array | Specifies the branches for which the workflow will be triggered on push events. In this case, it's only the 'main' branch. |
| `pull_request` | event | Triggers the workflow on pull request events. |
| `workflow_dispatch` | event | Allows triggering the workflow manually via the GitHub Actions interface. |

### `env:`
#### Description
Defines environment variables available to all jobs in the workflow.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `GO_VERSION` | string | Specifies the Go version to be used in the workflow. |

### `jobs:`
#### Description
Contains a collection of jobs that run in parallel by default.

####  Internal Logic
Each job under `jobs` represents a separate linting task:

- **`go-lint`**: Lints Go code using `golangci-lint`.
- **`markdown-lint`**: Lints Markdown files using `markdownlint-cli2`.
- **`ui-lint`**: Lints UI code (presumably JavaScript) using `npm run lint`.
- **`go-mod-tidy`**: Ensures the Go module dependency file is tidy.

Each job defines its own set of steps for checking out the code, setting up the environment, and running the linting tools. 

### `steps:`
#### Description
A sequence of tasks that are executed in order as part of a job.

#### Internal Logic
Each step under `steps` represents an individual action within a job. Common actions include:

- **`uses: actions/checkout@v4`**: Checks out the repository's code.
- **`uses: actions/setup-go@v5`**: Sets up the Go environment.
- **`uses: golangci/golangci-lint-action@v6.1.0`**: Runs `golangci-lint` for Go code linting.
- **`uses: DavidAnson/markdownlint-cli2-action@v16`**: Runs `markdownlint-cli2` for Markdown linting.
- **`uses: actions/setup-node@v4`**: Sets up the Node.js environment.
- `run: npm ci && npm run lint`: Installs dependencies and runs linting for the UI code.
- `run: go mod tidy`: Runs `go mod tidy` to clean up the Go module dependencies.
- `run: git diff-index --quiet HEAD -- || (echo "Please run 'go mod tidy' and commit changes." && exit 1)`: Checks if the `go mod tidy` command introduced any changes and fails the job if it did.
