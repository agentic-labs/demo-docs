## High-level description
This YAML file defines a pre-commit hook for validating Flipt feature flag configurations. It specifies how the `flipt validate` command should be executed as part of a pre-commit process, targeting specific YAML files that contain feature flag definitions.

### Pre-commit hook configuration
#### Description
This YAML configuration defines a single pre-commit hook named "flipt-validate" that runs the `flipt validate` command on specific YAML files to validate Flipt feature flag configurations.

#### Internal Logic
The hook is configured with the following properties:
- `id`: Unique identifier for the hook
- `name`: Human-readable name of the hook
- `description`: Brief explanation of the hook's purpose
- `entry`: The command to be executed
- `language`: The programming language of the hook
- `types`: File types the hook should run on
- `pass_filenames`: Whether to pass filenames to the hook
- `files`: A regular expression pattern to match specific files

The `files` pattern is defined using a regular expression that matches the following file patterns:
1. `features.yaml`
2. `features.yml`
3. Any file ending with `.features.yaml`
4. Any file ending with `.features.yml`

This ensures that the hook only runs on files that are likely to contain Flipt feature flag configurations.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| flipt | The `flipt validate` command is used to validate feature flag configurations |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| id | string | flipt-validate | Unique identifier for the pre-commit hook |
| name | string | flipt validate | Human-readable name of the hook |
| description | string | Validate feature flag configuration for Flipt. | Brief explanation of the hook's purpose |
| entry | string | flipt validate | The command to be executed by the hook |
| language | string | golang | The programming language of the hook |
| types | list | [yaml] | File types the hook should run on |
| pass_filenames | boolean | false | Whether to pass filenames to the hook |
| files | string | (regex pattern) | Regular expression to match specific files |

This pre-commit hook configuration ensures that Flipt feature flag configurations are validated before commits are made, helping to maintain the integrity of feature flag definitions in the project.
