## High-level description
The code defines a Go struct `Analytics` that serves as a client SDK for accessing analytics functionality provided by a remote service. It specifically implements the `GetFlagEvaluationsCount` method for retrieving aggregated flag evaluation counts.

## Code Structure
The `Analytics` struct holds a reference to a gRPC client (`transport`) for communicating with the remote analytics service and an authentication provider for handling authentication. The `GetFlagEvaluationsCount` method utilizes these components to make authenticated requests to the service.

## References
- `analytics.AnalyticsServiceClient`: This symbol, likely an interface from the `go.flipt.io/flipt/rpc/flipt/analytics` package, defines the gRPC client methods for interacting with the analytics service.
- `ClientAuthenticationProvider`: This symbol, likely an interface, is responsible for providing authentication credentials for the gRPC client.

## Symbols

### `Analytics`
#### Description
A struct representing the analytics SDK client. It provides methods for interacting with the analytics service.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a struct definition, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a struct definition, not a function.

### `GetFlagEvaluationsCount`
#### Description
This method retrieves aggregated flag evaluation counts from the analytics service. It uses the provided `GetFlagEvaluationsCountRequest` to specify the query parameters.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ctx | context.Context | The context for the request. |
| v | *analytics.GetFlagEvaluationsCountRequest | The request object containing query parameters for flag evaluation counts. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| *analytics.GetFlagEvaluationsCountResponse |  | The response object containing the aggregated flag evaluation counts. |
| error | error | An error object if the request fails. |

#### Internal Logic
1.  Authenticates the request context using the `authenticationProvider`.
2.  Calls the `GetFlagEvaluationsCount` method of the underlying gRPC client (`transport`) with the authenticated context and the provided request object.
3.  Returns the response from the gRPC client or an error if any step fails.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| context | Provides a mechanism for carrying request-scoped values and cancellation signals. |
| go.flipt.io/flipt/rpc/flipt/analytics |  Provides the gRPC client and message definitions for interacting with the analytics service. |
