## High-level description
The code in `grpc.sdk.gen.go` defines a gRPC transport for the Flipt SDK. It provides a `Transport` struct that implements the `_go.Transport` interface and exposes various client methods for interacting with different Flipt services, such as authentication, evaluation, and metadata.

## Code Structure
The `Transport` struct holds a `grpc.ClientConnInterface` for communication with the gRPC server. It provides methods like `AuthClient()`, `EvaluationClient()`, `FliptClient()`, and `MetaClient()` that return specific client instances for interacting with corresponding Flipt services. The `authClient` struct further exposes methods for accessing different authentication services.

## Symbols

### `Transport`
#### Description
The `Transport` struct implements the `_go.Transport` interface and provides methods for accessing different Flipt service clients.

#### Inputs
- `cc`: `grpc.ClientConnInterface` - A gRPC client connection interface for communication with the server.

#### Outputs
- `Transport`: A `Transport` instance initialized with the provided gRPC client connection.

#### Internal Logic
The `Transport` struct simply stores the provided `grpc.ClientConnInterface` and uses it to create and return specific client instances for different Flipt services.

### `authClient`
#### Description
The `authClient` struct provides methods for accessing different authentication service clients.

#### Inputs
- `cc`: `grpc.ClientConnInterface` - A gRPC client connection interface for communication with the server.

#### Outputs
- `authClient`: An `authClient` instance initialized with the provided gRPC client connection.

#### Internal Logic
The `authClient` struct uses the provided `grpc.ClientConnInterface` to create and return specific client instances for different authentication services, such as `PublicAuthenticationServiceClient`, `AuthenticationServiceClient`, and others.

### `NewTransport`
#### Description
The `NewTransport` function creates a new `Transport` instance with the provided gRPC client connection.

#### Inputs
- `cc`: `grpc.ClientConnInterface` - A gRPC client connection interface for communication with the server.

#### Outputs
- `Transport`: A `Transport` instance initialized with the provided gRPC client connection.

#### Internal Logic
The function simply creates a new `Transport` struct and initializes it with the provided `grpc.ClientConnInterface`.
