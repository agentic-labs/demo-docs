## High-level description
The code defines an example function demonstrating how to create a new `Transport` instance for the Flipt SDK using a gRPC client connection. This transport is then used to initialize the Flipt SDK and make a call to retrieve metadata information.

## References
- `sdk.New`: This function is assumed to be part of the Flipt SDK and is used to initialize a new SDK instance.
- `NewTransport`: This function is defined in the same package and is responsible for creating a new `Transport` instance.

## Symbols
### `ExampleNewTransport`
#### Description
This example function showcases how to create a new gRPC transport for the Flipt SDK and use it to make a simple API call.

#### Inputs
This function takes no inputs.

#### Outputs
This function has no explicit outputs, but it demonstrates the usage of the `NewTransport` function and the Flipt SDK.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Create a gRPC client connection:** A new gRPC client connection is created using `grpc.NewClient` by connecting to "localhost:9000".
2. **Create a new `Transport` instance:** The `NewTransport` function is called with the gRPC client connection to create a new `Transport` instance.
3. **Initialize the Flipt SDK:** The `sdk.New` function is called with the created `Transport` instance to initialize a new Flipt SDK instance.
4. **Make an API call:** The `Meta().GetInfo` method is called on the SDK instance to retrieve metadata information. This demonstrates a simple API call using the created transport.
