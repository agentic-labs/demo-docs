## High-level description
This directory contains the gRPC transport implementation for the Flipt SDK in Go. It provides the necessary components to establish a gRPC connection with a Flipt server and interact with various Flipt services, such as authentication, evaluation, and metadata retrieval.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory enables developers to create a gRPC-based transport for the Flipt SDK. This transport allows applications to communicate with a Flipt server using gRPC, a high-performance, open-source universal RPC framework. The implementation provides methods to access different Flipt services, including authentication, evaluation, and metadata services. 

Here's a simplified explanation of the workflow:

1. A developer creates a gRPC client connection to a Flipt server.
2. They use this connection to create a new Transport instance.
3. The Transport instance is then used to initialize the Flipt SDK.
4. With the initialized SDK, the application can make calls to various Flipt services, such as retrieving metadata or performing feature flag evaluations.

This approach allows for efficient, type-safe, and protocol-buffer-based communication between the client application and the Flipt server.

## Key Files

### grpc.sdk.gen.go
This file contains the core implementation of the gRPC transport for the Flipt SDK. It defines the following key components:

1. `Transport` struct: Implements the `_go.Transport` interface and provides methods for accessing different Flipt service clients.

   ```go
   type Transport struct {
       cc grpc.ClientConnInterface
   }
   ```

2. `authClient` struct: Provides methods for accessing different authentication service clients.

   ```go
   type authClient struct {
       cc grpc.ClientConnInterface
   }
   ```

3. `NewTransport` function: Creates a new `Transport` instance with the provided gRPC client connection.

   ```go
   func NewTransport(cc grpc.ClientConnInterface) *Transport {
       return &Transport{cc: cc}
   }
   ```

The `Transport` struct exposes methods like `AuthClient()`, `EvaluationClient()`, `FliptClient()`, and `MetaClient()` that return specific client instances for interacting with corresponding Flipt services.

### example_test.go
This file contains an example demonstrating how to use the gRPC transport with the Flipt SDK. It showcases the following steps:

1. Creating a gRPC client connection
2. Initializing a new Transport instance
3. Creating a Flipt SDK instance with the transport
4. Making a simple API call to retrieve metadata

Here's a snippet from the example:

```go
func ExampleNewTransport() {
    conn, _ := grpc.NewClient("localhost:9000")
    defer conn.Close()

    transport := NewTransport(conn)
    client := sdk.New(transport)

    info, _ := client.Meta().GetInfo(context.Background())
    fmt.Println(info)
}
```

## Dependencies
The gRPC transport implementation relies on the following key dependencies:

1. `go.flipt.io/flipt/rpc/flipt`: This package contains the gRPC service definitions for Flipt, including protobuf-generated code for various Flipt services.

2. `go.flipt.io/flipt/sdk/go`: The core Flipt SDK for Go, which defines the interfaces and types that the gRPC transport implements.

3. `google.golang.org/grpc` (version not specified): The official gRPC library for Go, used for creating and managing gRPC connections and clients.

These dependencies were chosen to ensure compatibility with the Flipt ecosystem and to leverage the performance and type safety benefits of gRPC.

## Configuration
The gRPC transport itself doesn't require specific configuration files or environment variables. However, when using the transport, developers need to provide a properly configured gRPC client connection. This connection can be customized with various options, such as:

- Server address
- Authentication credentials
- Connection timeouts
- TLS/SSL settings

These configurations are typically set when creating the gRPC client connection, which is then passed to the `NewTransport` function.

In conclusion, this directory provides a crucial component for integrating Flipt into Go applications using gRPC. It offers a clean and efficient way to communicate with Flipt servers, leveraging the power and performance of gRPC while maintaining a simple and intuitive API for developers.
