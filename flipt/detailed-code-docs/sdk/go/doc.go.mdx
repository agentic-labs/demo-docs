## High-level description
The `sdk` package is the official Go SDK for interacting with Flipt, a feature flagging and A/B testing platform. It provides a unified API for communicating with a Flipt instance using either HTTP or gRPC protocols. The SDK allows developers to manage Flipt resources, evaluate feature flags, and authenticate their applications.

## Code Structure
The `sdk` package revolves around the `SDK` struct, which is created using the `New` function. The `New` function takes a `Transport` implementation as an argument, which can be either `grpc.NewTransport` or `http.NewTransport`, depending on the desired protocol. The `SDK` struct then provides access to various services like `Flipt`, `Auth`, `Meta`, and `Evaluation`, each handling different aspects of the Flipt API.

## References
- `go.flipt.io/flipt/sdk/go/grpc.NewTransport` - Provides the gRPC transport implementation.
- `go.flipt.io/flipt/sdk/go/http.NewTransport` - Provides the HTTP transport implementation.
- `ClientAuthenticationProvider` - Interface for authentication providers used to authenticate SDK requests.

## Symbols

### `package sdk`
#### Description
This package provides the Go SDK for interacting with Flipt. It offers a unified API for managing Flipt resources, evaluating feature flags, and authenticating applications using either HTTP or gRPC.

#### Internal Logic
The package utilizes a `Transport` interface to abstract the underlying communication protocol (HTTP or gRPC). It provides different authentication providers like `StaticTokenAuthenticationProvider`, `JWTAuthenticationProvider`, and `KubernetesAuthenticationProvider` to secure the communication with the Flipt server. The SDK exposes services like `Flipt`, `Auth`, `Meta`, and `Evaluation` to interact with different parts of the Flipt API.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `go.flipt.io/flipt/rpc/flipt` | Provides the gRPC definitions for the Flipt API. |
| `go.flipt.io/flipt/sdk/go/grpc` | Offers the gRPC transport implementation for the SDK. |
| `go.flipt.io/flipt/sdk/go/http` | Offers the HTTP transport implementation for the SDK. |
| `google.golang.org/grpc` | The gRPC framework for Go. |
| `net/http` | The Go standard library package for HTTP. |

## Error Handling
The SDK propagates errors returned by the underlying transport layer (HTTP or gRPC). It also returns errors if authentication fails or if there are issues with the provided input.
