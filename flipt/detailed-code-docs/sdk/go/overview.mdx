## High-level description
The `sdk/go` directory contains the Go SDK for Flipt, a feature flagging and A/B testing platform. This SDK provides a unified API for communicating with a Flipt instance using either HTTP or gRPC protocols. It allows developers to manage Flipt resources, evaluate feature flags, and authenticate their applications.

## What does it do?
The Flipt Go SDK enables developers to:
1. Connect to a Flipt server using either HTTP or gRPC.
2. Perform feature flag evaluations (boolean and variant).
3. Manage Flipt resources such as flags, segments, and rules.
4. Handle authentication and authorization.
5. Retrieve metadata and configuration information from the Flipt server.

The SDK abstracts the underlying communication protocol, providing a consistent interface regardless of whether HTTP or gRPC is used.

## Entry points
The main entry point for developers using this SDK is the `New` function in `sdk.gen.go`. This function creates a new SDK instance:

```go
func New(t Transport, opts ...Option) SDK
```

Developers typically use this function to create an SDK instance, which they can then use to access various Flipt services:

```go
client := sdk.New(transport)
// Use client to access services
info, err := client.Meta().GetInfo(context.Background())
```

## Key Files
1. `sdk.gen.go`: Defines the core SDK structure and interfaces.
2. `flipt.sdk.gen.go`: Implements the main Flipt service client.
3. `evaluation.sdk.gen.go`: Implements the evaluation service client.
4. `auth.sdk.gen.go`: Implements authentication-related clients.
5. `meta.sdk.gen.go`: Implements the metadata service client.
6. `analytics.sdk.gen.go`: Implements the analytics service client.
7. `grpc/grpc.sdk.gen.go`: Implements the gRPC transport.
8. `http/http.sdk.gen.go`: Implements the HTTP transport.

## Dependencies
The SDK relies on several key dependencies:

1. `go.flipt.io/flipt/rpc/flipt`: Contains the gRPC service definitions for Flipt.
2. `google.golang.org/grpc`: The official gRPC library for Go.
3. `google.golang.org/protobuf`: Protocol Buffers library for Go.
4. Standard Go libraries: `context`, `net/http`, etc.

## Configuration
The SDK can be configured using options passed to the `New` function. Key configuration points include:

1. Transport selection (HTTP or gRPC).
2. Authentication provider setup.
3. Custom HTTP client configuration (for HTTP transport).

Example configuration:

```go
token := sdk.StaticTokenAuthenticationProvider("your-token")
client := sdk.New(transport, sdk.WithAuthenticationProvider(token))
```

The SDK also supports different authentication methods, including static tokens, JWT, and Kubernetes service account tokens.

In conclusion, the Flipt Go SDK provides a comprehensive and flexible way for Go applications to interact with a Flipt server, supporting various transport protocols and authentication methods while maintaining a consistent and easy-to-use API.
