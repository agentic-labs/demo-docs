## High-level description
This directory contains the HTTP client implementation for the Flipt SDK in Go. It provides a set of client structs and methods that allow interaction with various Flipt services over HTTP, translating gRPC-style calls into RESTful HTTP requests.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory enables developers to interact with a Flipt server using HTTP requests instead of gRPC. It covers several key areas of Flipt functionality:

1. Analytics: Querying flag evaluation counts.
2. Authentication: Managing authentication methods, tokens, and providers (OIDC, Kubernetes, GitHub).
3. Evaluation: Performing boolean, variant, and batch evaluations of feature flags.
4. Core Flipt functionality: Interacting with various Flipt resources and operations.
5. Metadata: Retrieving server configuration and runtime information.

Each of these areas is implemented as a separate client struct with methods corresponding to the gRPC service methods defined in the Flipt API. The clients handle the conversion of gRPC-style method calls into HTTP requests, including request construction, parameter encoding, and response parsing.

## Entry points
The main entry point for developers using this SDK is the `Transport` struct defined in `http.sdk.gen.go`. This struct provides methods to create client instances for each service area:

- `AnalyticsClient()`: Returns an `AnalyticsServiceClient` for querying analytics data.
- `AuthClient()`: Returns an `authClient` for authentication-related operations.
- `EvaluationClient()`: Returns an `EvaluationServiceClient` for feature flag evaluations.
- `FliptClient()`: Returns a `FliptClient` for core Flipt operations.
- `MetaClient()`: Returns a `MetadataServiceClient` for retrieving server metadata.

Developers would typically create a `Transport` instance and then use these methods to obtain the specific clients they need for their application.

## Key Files
1. `analytics.sdk.gen.go`: Implements the analytics service client.
2. `auth.sdk.gen.go`: Implements various authentication-related clients.
3. `evaluation.sdk.gen.go`: Implements the evaluation service client.
4. `flipt.sdk.gen.go`: Implements the core Flipt service client.
5. `http.sdk.gen.go`: Defines the `Transport` struct and common HTTP utilities.
6. `meta.sdk.gen.go`: Implements the metadata service client.

Each of these files contains one or more client structs that implement the corresponding gRPC service interfaces using HTTP requests.

## Dependencies
The code relies on several key dependencies:

1. Standard Go libraries: `net/http`, `net/url`, `context`, `io`, `bytes`, `fmt`, `strconv`
2. Flipt-specific packages: `go.flipt.io/flipt/rpc/flipt/*` (various service-specific packages)
3. gRPC-related packages: `google.golang.org/grpc`, `google.golang.org/genproto/googleapis/rpc/status`
4. Protobuf-related packages: `google.golang.org/protobuf/encoding/protojson`, `google.golang.org/protobuf/types/known/emptypb`

These dependencies are used for HTTP communication, request/response handling, error management, and working with protocol buffer messages.

## Configuration
The main configuration point is the `NewTransport` function in `http.sdk.gen.go`. It allows setting the Flipt server address and provides options for customizing the HTTP client. The `WithHTTPClient` option allows passing a custom `http.Client` for fine-grained control over HTTP behavior.

Additionally, the code supports setting authorization headers for requests. This is handled automatically by the `roundTripFunc` defined in `http.sdk.gen.go`, which extracts authorization information from the request context.

In summary, this directory provides a comprehensive HTTP-based client implementation for the Flipt SDK in Go, allowing developers to interact with all aspects of a Flipt server using familiar HTTP requests while maintaining an interface similar to the gRPC-based API.
