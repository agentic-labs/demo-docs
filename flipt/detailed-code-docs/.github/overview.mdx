## High-level description
The `.github` directory contains configuration files and workflows for GitHub-specific features and automation tools used in the Flipt project. This includes issue templates, Dependabot configuration, Kodiak bot settings, and various GitHub Actions workflows that automate testing, building, releasing, and maintaining the codebase.

## What does it do?
This directory serves several key purposes:

1. Issue Management: It provides templates for bug reports and feature requests, ensuring that users submit well-structured and informative issues.

2. Dependency Management: The Dependabot configuration automates dependency updates for various package ecosystems used in the project.

3. Pull Request Automation: The Kodiak bot configuration streamlines the process of approving, updating, and merging pull requests.

4. Continuous Integration and Deployment: A comprehensive set of GitHub Actions workflows automate various aspects of the development lifecycle, including:
   - Running tests and linting checks
   - Building and releasing the application
   - Updating client libraries
   - Managing protocol buffer definitions
   - Performing security scans and benchmarks
   - Automating documentation tasks

These automations help maintain code quality, ensure consistent processes, and streamline development and release workflows for the Flipt project.

## Key Files

1. `.kodiak.toml`: Configures the Kodiak bot for automated pull request management, including automatic approvals for Dependabot PRs and setting the merge method to "squash".

2. `dependabot.yml`: Defines rules for Dependabot to automatically update dependencies across various package ecosystems used in the project, including Go modules, npm, GitHub Actions, and Docker.

3. `ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`: Contains templates for bug reports and feature requests, along with a configuration file for custom contact links.

4. `workflows/`: A directory containing numerous GitHub Actions workflows that automate various aspects of the development process, including:
   - `test.yml`: Runs unit tests for Go code, UI components, and database migrations.
   - `lint.yml`: Performs linting checks on Go, Markdown, and UI code.
   - `release.yml`: Handles the release process, including building binaries and publishing Docker images.
   - `integration-test.yml`: Runs integration tests for CLI, core components, and UI.
   - `proto.yml`: Manages protocol buffer definitions, including linting and breaking change detection.
   - Several other workflows for benchmarking, security scanning, and maintaining client libraries.

## Dependencies
The workflows in this directory rely on several external tools and services:

1. GitHub Actions: Various official actions for common tasks like checking out code and setting up environments.
2. Docker: For containerization and image management.
3. GoReleaser: Used for building and releasing Go applications.
4. Dagger: A portable devkit for CI/CD pipelines.
5. Buf: Tools for working with Protocol Buffers.
6. Node.js: Used for UI-related tasks.
7. Mage: A build tool for Go projects.
8. Codecov: For tracking code coverage.
9. StackHawk: For security scanning.

## Configuration
The workflows use various environment variables and secrets for configuration, including:

- Go version and Dagger version specifications
- Authentication tokens for GitHub, Docker Hub, and other services
- Signing keys for releases and macOS binaries
- Webhook URLs for notifications to Slack and Discord

These configurations allow the workflows to interact with various services and perform authenticated operations throughout the CI/CD process, ensuring smooth automation of the development lifecycle for the Flipt project.
