## High-level description
This directory contains issue templates for the Flipt project on GitHub. It includes templates for bug reports and feature requests, as well as a configuration file for custom contact links. These templates are designed to standardize and streamline the process of submitting issues and feature requests, ensuring that users provide comprehensive and structured information.

## What does it do?
The templates in this directory guide users through the process of submitting bug reports and feature requests for the Flipt project. They prompt users to provide specific details about their issues or ideas, helping the development team to understand and address them more effectively. 

For bug reports, users are asked to describe the bug, provide steps to reproduce it, and include relevant system information. For feature requests, users are prompted to describe the problem they're trying to solve and their ideal solution. Both templates encourage users to search for existing issues before submitting new ones, reducing duplicate reports.

Additionally, the configuration file sets up a custom contact link that directs users to the Flipt Discord community, providing an alternative channel for support and discussion.

## Key Files

1. **bug_report.yml**
   This file defines the template for bug reports. It includes fields for:
   - Bug description
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Expected behavior
   - Actual behavior
   - System information (OS, Flipt version, etc.)
   - Additional context

   The template uses a combination of text areas, checkboxes, and markdown sections to guide users through providing comprehensive bug reports.

2. **feature_request.yml**
   This file outlines the template for feature requests. It prompts users to provide:
   - A description of the problem they're trying to solve
   - Their ideal solution
   - Additional context or examples
   
   Like the bug report template, it uses various input types to structure the information.

3. **config.yml**
   This configuration file sets up a custom contact link in the issue sidebar, directing users to the Flipt Discord community. It enhances the issue submission process by providing an additional support channel.

## Configuration
The `config.yml` file configures a custom contact link with the following structure:

```yaml
contact_links:
  - name: Flipt Discord Community
    url: https://discord.gg/kRhEqgKBbK
    about: Join our Discord community for support and discussions.
```

This configuration adds a link to the Flipt Discord community in the issue sidebar, providing users with an alternative channel for support and discussions.

Both the bug report and feature request templates use YAML syntax to define their structure. They include configurations such as:

- `name`: The name of the template as it appears in the issue creation dropdown
- `description`: A brief description of the template's purpose
- `title`: A default title prefix for issues created using the template
- `labels`: Default labels automatically applied to issues
- `body`: The main content of the template, defining various input fields

For example, in the feature request template:

```yaml
name: Feature request
description: Suggest an idea for this project
title: "[Feature]: "
labels: ["enhancement"]
body:
  - type: textarea
    id: problem
    attributes:
      label: Problem
      description: Please describe the problem you are trying to solve.
    validations:
      required: true
  # ... more fields ...
```

These configurations ensure that issues are consistently formatted and labeled, making it easier for the development team to triage and address them.
