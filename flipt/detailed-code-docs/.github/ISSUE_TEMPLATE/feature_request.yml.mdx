## High-level description
This file defines a template for feature request issues in a GitHub repository. It provides a structured form for users to submit feature requests, ensuring they include essential information like problem description, desired solution, and additional context. 

## Symbols
### `feature_request.yml`
#### Description
This YAML file defines the structure and content of a feature request issue template for a GitHub repository. It guides users in providing comprehensive information when requesting new features.

#### Inputs
This file does not take any direct inputs. It serves as a template that is rendered by GitHub when a user creates a new issue using the "Feature request" template.

#### Outputs
When a user creates a new issue using this template, it generates a pre-populated issue form with the following sections:

| Section | Description |
|:-----|:------------|
| **Problem** | A required text area for the user to describe the problem they are trying to solve. |
| **Ideal Solution** | A required text area for the user to describe their desired solution to the problem. |
| **Search** | A required checkbox confirming the user has searched for similar issues before submitting. |
| **Additional Context** | An optional text area for providing additional context, including examples, OS, configuration details, database information, screenshots, and exported data. |
| **Attach an Export** | Instructions on how to export data using a command (`flipt export &gt; export.yml`) and attach the exported YAML file to the issue. |

#### Internal Logic
The template uses YAML syntax to define the issue form's structure. It includes:

- **`name`**: Specifies the template name displayed in the issue creation dropdown.
- **`description`**: Provides a brief description of the template's purpose.
- **`labels`**: Automatically applies the "enhancement" label to new feature request issues.
- **`body`**: Defines the content and structure of the issue form using a combination of markdown and input fields.
