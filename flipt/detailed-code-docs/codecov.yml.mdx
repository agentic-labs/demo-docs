## High-level description
This `codecov.yml` file is a configuration file for Codecov, a tool used for code coverage reporting. It specifies directories and files that should be ignored during code coverage analysis, helping to focus the coverage reports on the most relevant parts of the codebase.

## Symbols

### `ignore`
#### Description
The `ignore` key is used to specify a list of directories and file patterns that should be excluded from code coverage analysis.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| - | list of strings | Each string represents a directory path or file pattern to be ignored |

#### Internal Logic
The `ignore` list contains the following entries:
1. `"_tools"`: Ignores the `_tools` directory
2. `"build"`: Ignores the `build` directory
3. `"examples"`: Ignores the `examples` directory
4. `"hack"`: Ignores the `hack` directory
5. `"internal/cmd/protoc-*"`: Ignores any directories or files matching this pattern within the `internal/cmd` directory
6. `"rpc"`: Ignores the `rpc` directory
7. `"ui"`: Ignores the `ui` directory
8. `"**/mock_*.go"`: Ignores any Go files starting with `mock_` in any directory

These ignore patterns help exclude non-essential code, build artifacts, examples, and mock files from the coverage analysis, allowing the team to focus on the core codebase's coverage metrics.

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| ignore | list of strings | N/A | Specifies directories and file patterns to be ignored during code coverage analysis |

Note: This configuration file only contains the `ignore` option. Other Codecov configuration options are not present in this file.
