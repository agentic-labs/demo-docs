title: ".gitpod.yml"
---

## High-level description
This `.gitpod.yml` file configures the Gitpod environment for the project. It specifies the Docker image to use and defines tasks to be executed when the Gitpod workspace is initialized and started.

## Symbols

### image
#### Description
Specifies the Docker image to be used for the Gitpod workspace.

#### Internal Logic
The image is defined using a Dockerfile located at `.devcontainer/Dockerfile` in the project repository.

### tasks
#### Description
Defines a list of tasks to be executed in the Gitpod workspace.

#### Internal Logic
Two tasks are defined:
1. `init`: Runs the command `mage bootstrap` to initialize the workspace.
2. `command`: Displays the contents of the `.devcontainer/welcome-message.txt` file.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Mage | Used in the `init` task to run the `bootstrap` command |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| image.file | string | .devcontainer/Dockerfile | Specifies the location of the Dockerfile used to build the workspace image |

## Notes
1. The use of a custom Dockerfile suggests that the project requires a specific environment setup.
2. The `mage bootstrap` command in the `init` task likely sets up the project dependencies and initial configuration.
3. The welcome message displayed using the `cat` command provides initial information or instructions to users when they start the Gitpod workspace.

This configuration ensures that developers have a consistent and pre-configured environment when working on the project through Gitpod.
