title: ".eslintrc.js"

## High-level description
This code defines the ESLint configuration for the `container` package. It extends a custom ESLint configuration called "custom/react-internal".

## References
- `"custom/react-internal"`: This likely refers to a shared ESLint configuration preset, possibly located in a different package or a central location in the codebase.

## Symbols
### `module.exports`
#### Description
This statement exports an object that defines the ESLint configuration for the current package.

#### Internal Logic
The exported object has a single property:
- `extends`: This property specifies that the current configuration should extend the `"custom/react-internal"` configuration. This means that the rules and settings defined in `"custom/react-internal"` will be inherited by the current configuration.

## Dependencies
- **ESLint**: This code assumes the presence of ESLint, a popular JavaScript linting utility.
- **"custom/react-internal"**: This refers to a custom ESLint configuration that is not defined in this file. It is likely a shared configuration preset used across multiple packages or the entire codebase.
