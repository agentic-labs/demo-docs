## High-level description
The `packages/container` directory contains the source code, configuration, and documentation for the `@react-email/container` package. This package provides a Container component, which is a fundamental layout element for creating HTML emails using React. The Container component centers email content and ensures compatibility across various email clients.

## What does it do?
The Container component acts as a wrapper for email content, providing a consistent and responsive layout structure. It creates a centered table that occupies the full available width, applying default styles to ensure proper scaling on different screen sizes. This is crucial for maintaining consistency across various email clients, which often have different rendering capabilities compared to web browsers.

The package allows developers to easily incorporate this container into their React-based email templates, providing a solid foundation for building well-structured and responsive HTML emails.

## Entry points
The main entry point for developers using this package is the `index.ts` file in the `src` directory. This file exports the Container component, making it available for use in other parts of an email template application.

The core implementation of the Container component is found in `src/container.tsx`. This file defines the component's structure, props, and default styling.

## Key Files
1. `src/container.tsx`: This file contains the main implementation of the Container component. It uses `React.forwardRef` to allow access to the underlying HTML table element and applies specific attributes and styles for email compatibility.

2. `src/container.spec.tsx`: This file contains unit tests for the Container component, ensuring it renders correctly and produces the expected HTML output.

3. `package.json`: This file defines the package metadata, dependencies, and build scripts. It specifies the package version, entry points for different module systems, and peer dependencies.

4. `readme.md`: This file provides documentation for the package, including installation instructions and a basic usage example.

5. `CHANGELOG.md`: This file tracks the version history and changes made to the package over time.

## Dependencies
The package has the following key dependencies:

- `react`: The core React library, used as a peer dependency.
- `@react-email/render`: Used in the test suite for rendering React components to static HTML.

Development dependencies include:
- `typescript`: For TypeScript support and compilation.
- `eslint-config-custom`: For maintaining consistent code style.
- `tsconfig`: Shared TypeScript configuration.

## Configuration
The package uses several configuration files:

1. `tsconfig.json`: Configures the TypeScript compiler for this package. It extends a base configuration (`tsconfig/react-library.json`) and specifies include/exclude paths.

2. `.eslintrc.js`: Defines ESLint configuration for the package, extending a custom React-internal configuration.

3. `package.json`: Contains various configuration settings, including:
   - `"sideEffects": false`: Declares that the package has no side effects, allowing for better tree-shaking.
   - `"publishConfig": { "access": "public" }`: Configures the package for public publishing on npm.
   - `"engines": { "node": "&gt;=16.0.0" }`: Specifies the supported Node.js version.
