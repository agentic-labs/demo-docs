## High-level description
The `packages/container/src` directory houses the `Container` React component, a fundamental building block for creating HTML emails. This component provides a centered table structure with responsive styling, ensuring compatibility across various email clients. It serves as the base layout element for emails, wrapping the email content to provide consistent styling and structure.

## What does it do?
The `Container` component acts as a foundation for building HTML emails. Imagine you're constructing a house - the container is like the frame that provides structure and support. It ensures that the content inside, like text and images, is displayed correctly and consistently across different email platforms.

This component generates an HTML table that is centered on the page and occupies the full available width. It also applies default styles to ensure the email scales properly on different screen sizes. This is crucial because email clients often render HTML differently than web browsers.

## Entry points
The main entry point for developers is `index.ts`, which re-exports the `Container` component from `container.tsx`. The `container.spec.tsx` file contains unit tests for the component.

- `index.ts`: This file acts as the public interface for the `Container` component, making it easily accessible for other parts of the application.
- `container.tsx`: This file defines the actual `Container` component, handling its rendering logic and applying default styles.
- `container.spec.tsx`: This file contains unit tests to ensure the `Container` component functions correctly and renders the expected HTML output.

Data flows from `container.tsx` to `index.ts`, making the component available for use. The tests in `container.spec.tsx` import and utilize the component from `index.ts`.

## Key Files
### `container.tsx`
This file defines the `Container` component, a functional React component that utilizes `React.forwardRef` to access the underlying HTML `table` element. It accepts `children`, `style`, and additional props, which are spread onto the `table` element. The component renders a centered table with specific attributes for email compatibility, including `align="center"`, `width="100%"`, and `role="presentation"`. It also applies inline styles for responsiveness and any styles passed via the `style` prop.

## Dependencies
- `react`: This dependency provides the core React API for creating components and managing their lifecycle.
- `@react-email/render` (used in tests): This library is used within the unit tests to render React components into static HTML strings suitable for email clients.
