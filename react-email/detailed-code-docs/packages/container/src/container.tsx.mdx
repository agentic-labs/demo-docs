## High-level description
The `Container` component renders a centered table element that acts as a container for email content. It sets default styles for a responsive email layout, ensuring compatibility across different email clients.

## Code Structure
The `Container` component is a functional component that uses `React.forwardRef` to obtain a reference to the underlying HTML `table` element. It accepts `children`, `style`, and other props, which are spread onto the `table` element.

### `Container`
#### Description
This component renders a centered table element that serves as a container for email content. It applies default styles to ensure responsive layout and compatibility across email clients.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| children | React.ReactNode | The content to be rendered within the container. |
| style | React.CSSProperties | Inline styles to be applied to the container. |
| ...props | ContainerProps | Additional props to be spread onto the `table` element. |

#### Outputs
React.ReactElement - A rendered `table` element representing the email container.

#### Internal Logic
1. The component uses `React.forwardRef` to obtain a reference to the underlying `table` element.
2. It renders a `table` element with the following attributes:
    - `align="center"`: Centers the table horizontally.
    - `width="100%"`: Makes the table take up the full width of its parent container.
    - `border={0}`: Removes the default table border.
    - `cellPadding="0"`: Removes default cell padding.
    - `cellSpacing="0"`: Removes default cell spacing.
    - `ref={ref}`: Assigns the provided ref to the `table` element.
    - `role="presentation"`: Indicates that the table is used for presentational purposes.
    - `style`: Applies inline styles, including a `maxWidth` of `37.5em` for responsiveness, and any styles passed via the `style` prop.
3. Inside the table, it renders a `tbody` element.
4. Within the `tbody`, it renders a `tr` (table row) element with `width="100%"`.
5. Inside the `tr`, it renders a `td` (table cell) element containing the `children` prop.

#### Performance Considerations
This component is relatively simple and shouldn't pose any significant performance concerns.
