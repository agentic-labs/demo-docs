title: "tsconfig.json"
---

## High-level description
This file is a TypeScript configuration file (`tsconfig.json`) for the `container` package. It defines the TypeScript compiler options and file inclusion/exclusion rules for this specific package.

## Symbols
### `tsconfig.json`
#### Description
This file configures the TypeScript compiler for the `container` package. It extends a base configuration file (`tsconfig/react-library.json`) and customizes the include and exclude paths.

#### Inputs
This file does not take any inputs. It is read by the TypeScript compiler.

#### Outputs
This file does not produce any direct outputs. It influences the behavior of the TypeScript compiler.

#### Internal Logic
* **`extends`**: Specifies the base configuration file to inherit settings from. This allows for consistent configuration across multiple packages.
* **`include`**: An array of glob patterns specifying the files to include in the compilation process. In this case, it includes all files in the current directory.
* **`exclude`**: An array of glob patterns specifying the files and directories to exclude from the compilation process. This typically includes build artifacts, distribution folders, and external dependencies.

## Dependencies
This configuration file implicitly depends on the TypeScript compiler and the base configuration file it extends (`tsconfig/react-library.json`).
