## Symbols

### `test("quick safe render to string", () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
This is the main test case for the `quickSafeRenderToString` function. It creates a complex JSX structure with various elements and components, then renders it to a string and compares the result with a snapshot.

#### Internal Logic
1. Defines a custom `Component` that renders a div with a name prop.
2. Creates an `otherJsx` element with complex Tailwind classes.
3. Constructs a main `jsx` element that includes:
   - A div with Tailwind classes and inline styles
   - The custom `Component`
   - The `otherJsx` element (nested and as a sibling)
4. Calls `quickSafeRenderToString` with the `jsx` element.
5. Compares the result with a snapshot using Jest's `toMatchSnapshot()`.

### `Component`
#### Description
A simple functional React component that renders a div with a name prop.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| props | { name: string } | An object containing the name to be displayed |

#### Outputs
Returns a JSX element: a div with the provided name.

### `stylesFromAVariable`
#### Description
An object containing CSS properties to be used as inline styles.

## Dependencies
The test relies on Jest for running the test and snapshot comparison.

## Notes
- The test demonstrates the ability of `quickSafeRenderToString` to handle:
  1. Custom React components
  2. Nested JSX structures
  3. Tailwind CSS classes
  4. Inline styles
  5. Fragment elements (`&lt;&gt;...&lt;/&gt;`)
- The use of `toMatchSnapshot()` suggests that the exact output is not being checked in the test file itself, but rather compared to a previously saved snapshot.
