## High-level description
This code is a unit test for the `separateMediaQueriesFromCSS` function. It verifies that the function correctly separates CSS content into two parts: CSS without media queries and an array of media queries.

## References
The test file references the `separateMediaQueriesFromCSS` function from the "./separate-media-queries-from-css" module.

## Symbols

### `test("separateMediaQueriesFromCSS()")`
#### Description
This is a Jest test case that checks the functionality of the `separateMediaQueriesFromCSS` function.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Arrange**: The test sets up a sample CSS string containing both regular CSS and media queries.
2. **Act**: It calls the `separateMediaQueriesFromCSS` function with the sample CSS and destructures the result into `cssWithoutMediaQueries` and `mediaQueries`.
3. **Assert**: The test uses Jest's `expect` function to verify:
   - The `cssWithoutMediaQueries` contains only the non-media query CSS.
   - The `mediaQueries` array contains the expected media query strings.

#### Performance Considerations
The test uses a relatively small CSS string, so performance is not a significant concern here. However, for larger CSS files, the performance of the `separateMediaQueriesFromCSS` function could be more critical.

## Notes
1. The test case uses template literals for multiline strings, which improves readability.
2. The CSS classes in the test case use Tailwind CSS-like naming conventions (e.g., `text-blue-700`, `sm:text-blue-400`).
3. The test checks for exact string matches, including whitespace and newlines, which might make the test brittle if the formatting of the output changes.
4. The test case covers both standard media queries and a negated media query (`not all and (min-width: 640px)`), demonstrating the function's ability to handle different types of media queries.

This test provides good coverage for the basic functionality of the `separateMediaQueriesFromCSS` function, ensuring it correctly separates media queries from regular CSS and maintains the structure of both parts.
