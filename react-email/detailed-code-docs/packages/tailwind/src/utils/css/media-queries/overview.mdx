## High-level description
This directory provides functionality for separating media queries from CSS strings. It contains a utility function `separateMediaQueriesFromCSS` and its corresponding unit test.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory is responsible for extracting media queries from a CSS string. Imagine you have a stylesheet with rules for different screen sizes, marked by `@media` queries. This function takes that stylesheet, identifies all the media queries, and separates them from the rest of the CSS. The result is two parts: the CSS without any media queries and a list of all the extracted media queries.

## Key Files
* **separate-media-queries-from-css.ts:** This file contains the main logic for separating media queries from CSS strings. It defines the `separateMediaQueriesFromCSS` function, which takes a CSS string as input and returns a tuple containing the CSS without media queries and an array of extracted media queries.
* **separate-media-queries-from-css.spec.ts:** This file contains unit tests for the `separateMediaQueriesFromCSS` function. It ensures that the function correctly extracts media queries from various CSS input strings and returns the expected output.
