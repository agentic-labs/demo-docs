## Symbols

### `separateMediaQueriesFromCSS`
#### Description
This function takes a CSS string as input, extracts all media queries from it, and returns an array containing the CSS without media queries and an array of the extracted media queries.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| css | string | The input CSS string containing both regular CSS rules and media queries |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| [cssWithoutMediaQueries, mediaQueries] | [string, string[]] | A tuple containing the CSS string without media queries and an array of extracted media queries |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initialize `cssWithoutMediaQueries` with the input CSS string.
2. Initialize an empty array `mediaQueries` to store extracted media queries.
3. Use a regular expression to match all media queries in the input CSS.
4. For each matched media query:
   - Remove the media query from `cssWithoutMediaQueries`.
   - Add the media query to the `mediaQueries` array.
5. Return the tuple `[cssWithoutMediaQueries, mediaQueries]`.

## Dependencies
The function does not rely on any external libraries or modules.

## Performance Considerations
The function uses a regular expression with the global flag to match all occurrences of media queries in the input CSS. For very large CSS strings, this approach might have performance implications. However, for typical use cases, the performance should be acceptable.

## References
This function is used in the `useTailwindStyles` hook from the `packages/tailwind/src/hooks/use-tailwind-styles.tsx` file. It is part of a larger system for processing Tailwind CSS styles in a React environment.

## Testing
The function is tested in the `packages/tailwind/src/utils/css/media-queries/separate-media-queries-from-css.spec.ts` file. The test case verifies that the function correctly separates media queries from regular CSS rules and returns the expected output.
