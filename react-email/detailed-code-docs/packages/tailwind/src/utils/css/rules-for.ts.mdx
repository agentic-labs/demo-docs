## High-level description
This code defines a utility function `rulesFor` that parses CSS rules from a given string of CSS content. It extracts individual CSS rules, breaking them down into their selector and content components, and yields them as structured objects.

## Symbols

### `Rule` (interface)
#### Description
Defines the structure for a CSS rule object, containing the full rule value, selector, and content.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| value | string | The full CSS rule as a string |
| selector | string | The CSS selector for the rule |
| content | string | The CSS properties and values for the rule |

### `rulesFor` (generator function)
#### Description
A generator function that parses CSS rules from a given string and yields `Rule` objects for each parsed rule.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| cssWithRules | string | A string containing CSS rules to be parsed |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Rule | Generator&lt;Rule&gt; | Yields `Rule` objects for each parsed CSS rule |

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses a regular expression to match CSS rules in the input string.
2. The regular expression `/\s*\.([\S]+)\s*{([^}]*)}/gm` matches:
   - `\s*`: Any leading whitespace
   - `\.`: A literal dot (for class selectors)
   - `([\S]+)`: The selector (captured group)
   - `\s*`: Any whitespace between selector and opening brace
   - `{`: Opening brace
   - `([^}]*)`: The rule content (captured group)
   - `}`: Closing brace
   - `gm` flags: Global and multiline matching
3. Iterates over all matches using `matchAll`.
4. For each match, yields a `Rule` object with the extracted components.

## References
This utility is used in the `useTailwindStyles` hook (from the related code snippet) to parse CSS rules generated for Tailwind classes.

## Performance Considerations
The use of a generator function allows for efficient memory usage when processing large CSS strings, as it yields results one at a time instead of creating a large array in memory.

## Dependencies
This code relies on ECMAScript 6+ features, including generator functions and the `matchAll` method for string objects.
