## High-level description
This directory contains utility functions for manipulating and processing CSS in the context of a Tailwind CSS implementation. It provides functionality for separating media queries, minifying CSS, and parsing CSS rules.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory performs several key operations on CSS:

1. Separates media queries from CSS strings: This allows for isolating responsive styles from base styles, which can be useful for processing or applying styles differently based on screen sizes.

2. Minifies CSS: It removes unnecessary whitespace, comments, and formatting from CSS strings to reduce file size and improve load times.

3. Parses CSS rules: It extracts individual CSS rules from a larger CSS string, breaking them down into their selector and content components. This is useful for analyzing or manipulating specific styles within a larger stylesheet.

These utilities work together to provide a comprehensive set of tools for handling CSS in a Tailwind-based project, enabling efficient processing and manipulation of styles.

## Key Files

1. **separate-media-queries-from-css.ts**
   - Contains the `separateMediaQueriesFromCSS` function
   - Extracts media queries from a CSS string
   - Returns a tuple with CSS without media queries and an array of extracted media queries

2. **minify-css.ts**
   - Defines the `minifyCss` function
   - Reduces CSS size by removing unnecessary characters and whitespace
   - Uses regular expressions for various transformations

3. **rules-for.ts**
   - Implements the `rulesFor` generator function
   - Parses CSS rules from a given string
   - Yields `Rule` objects containing the full rule, selector, and content

Each of these files plays a crucial role in processing and manipulating CSS within the Tailwind implementation:

- The media query separation allows for more flexible handling of responsive styles.
- CSS minification optimizes the final output for better performance.
- The rule parsing functionality enables granular analysis and manipulation of individual CSS rules.

## Dependencies
The code in this directory primarily relies on native JavaScript/TypeScript features and does not introduce any external dependencies. It makes use of:

- ECMAScript 6+ features, including generator functions
- Regular expressions for pattern matching and string manipulation

## Configuration
This directory does not contain any specific configuration files or environment variables. The utilities are designed to be flexible and can be used with different CSS inputs without additional configuration.

Here's an example of how these utilities might be used together in a workflow:

```typescript
import { separateMediaQueriesFromCSS } from './separate-media-queries-from-css';
import { minifyCss } from './minify-css';
import { rulesFor } from './rules-for';

// Example usage
const originalCSS = `
  .example { color: red; }
  @media (min-width: 768px) {
    .example { color: blue; }
  }
`;

// Separate media queries
const [baseCSS, mediaQueries] = separateMediaQueriesFromCSS(originalCSS);

// Minify the base CSS
const minifiedBaseCSS = minifyCss(baseCSS);

// Parse rules from the minified CSS
for (const rule of rulesFor(minifiedBaseCSS)) {
  console.log(`Selector: ${rule.selector}, Content: ${rule.content}`);
}

// Process media queries separately
const minifiedMediaQueries = mediaQueries.map(minifyCss);
```

This example demonstrates how the utilities can be combined to process CSS by separating media queries, minifying the resulting CSS, and then parsing individual rules for further processing or analysis. This modular approach allows for flexible CSS handling in various scenarios within a Tailwind-based project.
