## High-level description
The `minifyCss` function is a utility that takes a CSS string as input and returns a minified version of it. It removes unnecessary whitespace, comments, and formatting to reduce the size of the CSS code while preserving its functionality.

## Symbols

### `minifyCss`
#### Description
This function takes a CSS string and applies a series of regular expression replacements to minimize its size by removing unnecessary characters and whitespace.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| css  | string | The input CSS string to be minified |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| (return value) | string | The minified CSS string |

#### Internal Logic
The function applies the following transformations to the input CSS string:
1. Removes all comments (/* ... */)
2. Removes extra spaces after semicolons and colons
3. Removes spaces before and after brackets and parentheses
4. Removes spaces and semicolons before closing curly braces

Each transformation is applied using a regular expression replacement.

## Dependencies
This function does not rely on any external libraries or modules.

## Performance Considerations
The `minifyCss` function uses multiple regular expression replacements, which can be computationally expensive for very large CSS strings. For most use cases, the performance impact should be negligible, but it's worth noting for scenarios involving extremely large CSS files.

## Usage in Related Code
The `minifyCss` function is used in two places in the related code snippets:

1. In the `Tailwind` component (`packages/tailwind/src/tailwind.tsx`):
   It's used to minify the CSS for non-inline styles before inserting them into a `&lt;style&gt;` tag in the `&lt;head&gt;` of the document.

2. In the test file (`packages/tailwind/src/utils/tailwindcss/get-css-for-markup.spec.tsx`):
   It's used to minify the CSS generated by `getCssForMarkup` before comparing it to an expected snapshot in the test.

These usages demonstrate that the `minifyCss` function plays a crucial role in optimizing the CSS output of the Tailwind component and in verifying the correctness of CSS generation in tests.
