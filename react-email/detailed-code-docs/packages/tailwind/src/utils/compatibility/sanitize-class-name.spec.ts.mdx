### `test`
#### Description
This is a Jest test function that checks the behavior of the `sanitizeClassName` function.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| description | string | A string describing the test case |
| testFunction | function | The function containing the test logic |

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls the `sanitizeClassName` function with a complex CSS class name containing special characters.
2. Uses Jest's `expect` function to assert that the output matches the expected sanitized class name.

### `sanitizeClassName`
#### Description
This function is imported from the "./sanitize-class-name" module and is the subject of the test. It sanitizes CSS class names by replacing special characters with safe alternatives.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Jest | Testing framework used for writing and running the unit test |

## Error Handling
This test file does not implement any specific error handling. It relies on Jest's built-in assertion mechanism to report test failures.

## Additional Notes
1. The test case uses a complex CSS class name that includes various special characters and CSS functions, demonstrating the function's ability to handle intricate cases.
2. The expected output shows that:
   - Square brackets `[]` are removed
   - Parentheses `()` are removed
   - The plus sign `+` is replaced with "plus"
   - Percentage signs `%` are replaced with "pc"
   - Forward slashes `/` are replaced with underscores `_`
3. This test ensures that the `sanitizeClassName` function correctly handles a variety of special characters and produces a sanitized class name that is safe for use in email clients or other environments where special characters might cause issues.
