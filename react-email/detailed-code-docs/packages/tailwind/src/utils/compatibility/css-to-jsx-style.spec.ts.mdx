## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for the `cssToJsxStyle` and `getCssDeclarations` functions, which are responsible for converting CSS rules to JSX-compatible style objects. The tests cover various scenarios, including simple and complex CSS rules, browser prefixes, custom properties, and edge cases.

## References
The tests reference the `cssToJsxStyle` and `getCssDeclarations` functions from the "./css-to-jsx-style" module.

## Symbols

### `test("transforms a rule")`
#### Description
This test checks if a simple CSS rule is correctly transformed into a JSX style object.

#### Internal Logic
- Calls `cssToJsxStyle` with a simple CSS rule
- Expects the result to be an object with the correct property and value

### `test("getCssDeclarations()")`
#### Description
This test verifies the `getCssDeclarations` function's ability to parse a complex CSS string into an array of property-value pairs.

#### Internal Logic
- Defines a multi-line CSS string with various properties
- Calls `getCssDeclarations` with the CSS string
- Expects the result to be an array of objects, each containing a `property` and `value`

### `test("transforms multiple rules")`
#### Description
This test ensures that multiple CSS rules are correctly transformed into a JSX style object.

#### Internal Logic
- Calls `cssToJsxStyle` with multiple CSS rules
- Expects the result to be an object with multiple properties, including camelCased property names

### `test("transforms no rules")`
#### Description
This test checks the behavior of `cssToJsxStyle` when given empty or invalid input.

#### Internal Logic
- Calls `cssToJsxStyle` with empty strings and invalid CSS
- Expects the result to be an empty object in all cases

### `test("transforms rules with browser prefixes")`
#### Description
This test verifies that browser-prefixed CSS properties are correctly transformed.

#### Internal Logic
- Calls `cssToJsxStyle` with prefixed CSS properties
- Expects the result to have correctly transformed property names (e.g., `WebkitTransform`, `msTransform`)

### `test("transforms float rule property to cssFloat")`
#### Description
This test checks if the `float` CSS property is correctly transformed to `cssFloat`.

#### Internal Logic
- Calls `cssToJsxStyle` with a `float` property
- Expects the result to use `cssFloat` instead of `float`

### Additional tests
There are several other tests that check various aspects of the `cssToJsxStyle` function, including:
- Handling of URLs and data URLs in CSS values
- Proper handling of quoted semicolons and colons in CSS values
- Case-insensitive property name handling
- Transformation of custom CSS properties (variables)
- Ignoring empty rules
- Handling of excessive or no whitespace in CSS input

Each of these tests follows a similar pattern:
1. Call `cssToJsxStyle` with a specific CSS input
2. Assert that the output matches the expected JSX style object

## Dependencies
The code uses Jest for testing, as evidenced by the use of `test` and `expect` functions.

## Error Handling
The tests implicitly check error handling by testing various edge cases and invalid inputs. The `cssToJsxStyle` function is expected to handle these cases gracefully, typically by ignoring invalid rules or returning empty objects.
