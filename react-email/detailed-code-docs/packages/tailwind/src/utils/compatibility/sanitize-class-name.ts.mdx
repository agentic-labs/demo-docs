## High-level description
The `sanitizeClassName` function is a utility designed to replace special characters in CSS class names to ensure compatibility with email clients. It takes a string representing a class name and returns a sanitized version of that class name, replacing problematic characters with safe alternatives.

## Symbols

### `sanitizeClassName`
#### Description
This function sanitizes CSS class names by replacing special characters that might cause issues in email clients with safe alternatives. It uses a series of `replaceAll` methods for specific characters and a regular expression to handle any remaining non-alphanumeric characters.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| className | string | The original CSS class name to be sanitized |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| sanitizedClassName | string | The sanitized version of the input class name |

#### Internal Logic
1. Replace "+" with "plus"
2. Remove "[" and "]"
3. Replace "%" with "pc"
4. Remove "(" and ")"
5. Replace "!" with "imprtnt"
6. Replace "&gt;" with "gt"
7. Replace "&lt;" with "lt"
8. Replace "=" with "eq"
9. Replace any remaining non-alphanumeric characters (except "-" and "_") with "_"

## References
The `sanitizeClassName` function is used in the `Tailwind` component (from `packages/tailwind/src/tailwind.tsx`) to sanitize class names that cannot be inlined. This ensures that Tailwind classes with special characters are properly handled when used in email templates.

## Dependencies
This code does not rely on any external libraries or modules.

## Error Handling
The function does not implement any specific error handling. It assumes that the input is a valid string and processes it accordingly.

## Performance Considerations
The function uses multiple `replaceAll` calls and a regular expression replacement, which may impact performance for very large strings or when called frequently. However, for typical class name lengths, the performance impact should be negligible.

## Tests
A test file (`sanitize-class-name.spec.ts`) is provided to verify the functionality of the `sanitizeClassName` function. The test case checks if the function correctly sanitizes a complex class name containing various special characters:

```typescript
test("sanitizeClassName", () =&gt; {
  expect(sanitizeClassName("min-height-[calc(25px+100%-20%*2/4)]")).toBe(
    "min-height-calc25pxplus100pc-20pc_2_4",
  );
});
```

This test ensures that the function correctly handles brackets, percentage signs, plus signs, and other special characters in a Tailwind-style class name.
