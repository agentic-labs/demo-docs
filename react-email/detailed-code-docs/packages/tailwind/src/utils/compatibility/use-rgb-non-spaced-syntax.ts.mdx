## High-level description
This code defines a utility function `useRgbNonSpacedSyntax` that modifies CSS strings to use non-spaced syntax for RGB color values. This is done to ensure compatibility with email clients that don't support spaced syntax in RGB color definitions.

## Symbols

### `useRgbNonSpacedSyntax`
#### Description
This function takes a CSS string as input and replaces all instances of RGB color definitions using spaced syntax with non-spaced syntax. It handles both RGB and RGBA color definitions.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| css  | string | The input CSS string containing RGB color definitions |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| (return value) | string | The modified CSS string with non-spaced RGB syntax |

#### Internal Logic
1. The function uses a regular expression to match RGB and RGBA color definitions in the input CSS string.
2. It then replaces each matched color definition with a non-spaced version:
   - For RGB, it changes `rgb(R G B)` to `rgb(R,G,B)`.
   - For RGBA, it changes `rgb(R G B / A)` to `rgb(R,G,B,A)`.
3. The alpha value is only included if it's not "1" or undefined.

## Dependencies
This utility function doesn't have any external dependencies. It uses JavaScript's built-in `String.prototype.replaceAll()` method and regular expressions.

## References
The code mentions that it's inspired by the `tw-to-css` library, specifically referencing the file `https://github.com/vinicoder/tw-to-css/blob/main/src/util/format-css.ts`.

## Usage
Based on the related code snippet provided, this utility is used in the `useTailwindStyles` hook (from `packages/tailwind/src/hooks/use-tailwind-styles.tsx`). The hook applies this function to the CSS generated from Tailwind classes to ensure compatibility with email clients.

```typescript
const css = useRgbNonSpacedSyntax(getCssForMarkup(markup, config));
```

This usage suggests that the utility is part of a larger system for processing Tailwind CSS for email compatibility.

## Performance Considerations
The function uses a regular expression with the global flag, which means it will process the entire input string. For very large CSS strings, this could potentially be a performance bottleneck. However, for typical use cases, the performance impact should be negligible.
