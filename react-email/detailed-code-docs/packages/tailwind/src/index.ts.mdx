## High-level description
This file serves as the main entry point for the Tailwind package. It exports all the symbols from the "tailwind" module, making them available for use in other parts of the application or by external consumers of this package.

## Symbols

### `export * from "./tailwind"`
#### Description
This is a re-export statement that exports all named exports from the "./tailwind" module. It allows users of this package to import symbols directly from the package root instead of having to specify the exact file path.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
All named exports from the "./tailwind" module

## References
The code references the "./tailwind" module, which likely contains the main implementation of the Tailwind functionality for this package.

Based on the related code snippet provided, the "./tailwind" module exports the following:

1. `TailwindConfig` type
2. `TailwindProps` interface
3. `Tailwind` React component

These exports are now available to be imported directly from the package root.

## Dependencies
The main dependency for this file is the "./tailwind" module, which contains the actual implementation of the Tailwind functionality.

## Notes
1. This pattern of re-exporting all symbols from a main implementation file is common in JavaScript/TypeScript projects. It allows for a cleaner package structure and easier imports for consumers of the package.
2. The actual functionality of the Tailwind component and related types is implemented in the "./tailwind" module, which is not directly visible in this file.
3. Users of this package can now import the `Tailwind` component and related types directly from the package root, like this:
   ```typescript
   import { Tailwind, TailwindConfig, TailwindProps } from '@package-name/tailwind';
   ```
   Instead of having to specify the exact file path:
   ```typescript
   import { Tailwind, TailwindConfig, TailwindProps } from '@package-name/tailwind/tailwind';
   ```

This file structure provides a clean and organized way to expose the package's functionality while keeping the implementation details encapsulated in separate files.
