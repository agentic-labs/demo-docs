## High-level description
The `packages/tailwind/src/hooks` directory contains custom React hooks that facilitate the integration of Tailwind CSS into React components, particularly for email-specific use cases. These hooks handle the processing of Tailwind classes, conversion to inline styles, and management of media queries, ensuring compatibility with various email clients.

## What does it do?
This directory provides the logic for applying Tailwind CSS styles to React components in an email-friendly manner. It takes React components with Tailwind classes and converts them into components with inline styles, which is necessary for consistent rendering in different email clients. The hooks also handle media queries, separating them from inline styles and ensuring they are applied correctly.

## Entry points
The main entry point for developers is `use-tailwind-styles.tsx`, which exposes the `useTailwindStyles` hook. This hook is the core logic for processing Tailwind classes and generating the necessary style information.

Data flow:
1. The `useTailwindStyles` hook receives a React node and a Tailwind configuration object as input.
2. It processes the React node and extracts Tailwind classes.
3. The hook then generates CSS based on the extracted classes and the provided Tailwind configuration.
4. The generated CSS is further processed to separate inline styles from media queries.
5. Finally, the hook returns an object containing inline styles, sanitized media queries, and a list of non-inlinable classes.

## Key Files

### use-tailwind-styles.tsx
This file contains the `useTailwindStyles` hook, which is the core logic for processing Tailwind classes and generating style information. It takes a React node and a Tailwind configuration object as input and returns an object containing inline styles, sanitized media queries, and non-inlinable classes.

### use-style-inlining.ts
This file defines the `useStyleInlining` hook, which converts a map of class names to their corresponding styles into a function. This function can then be used to convert a string of class names into an object with inline styles and any remaining classes that couldn't be converted.

### use-tailwind-styles.spec.tsx
This file contains the test suite for the `useTailwindStyles` hook. It verifies that the hook correctly processes Tailwind classes, including media queries and nested elements, and returns the expected output format.

## Dependencies
