## High-level description
The `useTailwindStyles` hook is a crucial part of a Tailwind CSS implementation for React components. It processes React nodes and Tailwind configurations to generate the necessary styles, handling both inline styles and media queries. This hook is designed to work with email-specific React components, ensuring compatibility with various email clients.

## Code Structure
The `useTailwindStyles` hook is the main export of this file. It utilizes several utility functions imported from other modules to process CSS, handle media queries, and ensure compatibility with email clients. The hook returns an object containing style information that can be used to apply Tailwind styles to React components.

## Symbols

### `useTailwindStyles`
#### Description
This hook processes a React node and Tailwind configuration to generate the necessary styles for applying Tailwind classes to components.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| node | React.ReactNode | The React node to process |
| config | TailwindConfig | The Tailwind configuration object |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| stylePerClassMap | Record&lt;string, React.CSSProperties&gt; | A map of Tailwind classes to their corresponding CSS properties |
| sanitizedMediaQueries | string[] | An array of sanitized media query CSS strings |
| nonInlinableClasses | string[] | An array of class names that cannot be inlined |

#### Internal Logic
1. Renders the input node to a string using `quickSafeRenderToString`.
2. Generates CSS for the markup using `getCssForMarkup` and processes it with `useRgbNonSpacedSyntax`.
3. Separates media queries from the CSS using `separateMediaQueriesFromCSS`.
4. Processes non-media query CSS rules, converting them to a map of class names to CSS properties.
5. Processes media queries, sanitizing them and collecting non-inlinable classes.
6. Returns the processed style information.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| React | For React types and functionality |
| TailwindConfig | Type definition for Tailwind configuration |
| Various utility functions | For CSS processing, compatibility, and sanitization |

## Error Handling
This hook does not implement specific error handling. Errors from utility functions are not caught or handled explicitly.

## Performance Considerations
The hook processes CSS and generates style maps, which could be computationally expensive for large components or complex Tailwind configurations. Consider memoizing the result if the input node and config are stable.

## API/Interface Reference
This hook is intended to be used within a larger Tailwind implementation for React components, likely in conjunction with a `Tailwind` component that applies the generated styles to its children.
