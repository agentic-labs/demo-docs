## High-level description
This code defines a custom React hook called `useStyleInlining` that converts Tailwind CSS classes into inline React styles. It takes a map of class names to their corresponding styles and returns a function that can be used to convert a string of class names into an object with inline styles and any remaining classes that couldn't be converted.

## Symbols

### `useStyleInlining`
#### Description
This function is a custom React hook that creates and returns a style inlining function. The returned function converts a string of class names into inline styles based on a provided map of class names to styles.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| stylePerClass | Record&lt;string, React.CSSProperties&gt; | A map of class names to their corresponding React CSS properties |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| inlineFunction | (className: string) =&gt; { styles: React.CSSProperties; residualClassName: string } | A function that converts class names to inline styles |

#### Internal Logic
1. The hook returns a function that takes a `className` string as input.
2. This function splits the input `className` into individual classes.
3. It then iterates through each class:
   - If the class exists in the `stylePerClass` map, its styles are merged into the `styles` object.
   - If the class doesn't exist in the map, it's added to the `residualClasses` array.
4. Finally, it returns an object containing:
   - `styles`: The merged inline styles
   - `residualClassName`: A string of classes that couldn't be converted to inline styles

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| React | The hook is designed to work with React components and uses React types |

## Performance Considerations
This hook can potentially improve performance by converting Tailwind classes to inline styles, which can be more efficient for rendering in some cases. However, the performance impact would depend on the number of classes being processed and how frequently the returned function is called.

## Usage Context
Based on the related code snippets, this hook is used in the `Tailwind` component (from `packages/tailwind/src/tailwind.tsx`) to process and inline Tailwind classes. It's part of a larger system for handling Tailwind CSS in a React environment, possibly for email templates or similar use cases where inline styles are preferred.
