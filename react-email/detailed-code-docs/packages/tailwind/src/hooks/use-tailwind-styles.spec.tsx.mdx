## High-level description
This code defines a test suite for the `useTailwindStyles` hook. It verifies that the hook correctly processes Tailwind CSS classes, including media queries and nested elements, and returns the expected output format.

## Symbols

### `describe("useTailwindStyles()", () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
This is the main test suite for the `useTailwindStyles` hook. It contains two test cases that check different aspects of the hook's functionality.

### `test("with basic media queries and nested elements", () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
This test case verifies the behavior of `useTailwindStyles` when processing a simple React component with basic Tailwind classes, including a media query and nested elements.

#### Internal Logic
1. Arrange: Creates a React element with Tailwind classes.
2. Act: Calls `useTailwindStyles` with the created element and an empty config object.
3. Assert: Checks if the returned object matches the expected output, including:
   - Correct inline styles for non-media query classes
   - Properly formatted media query string
   - List of non-inlinable classes (those used in media queries)

### `test("with more media queries", () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
This test case checks the behavior of `useTailwindStyles` when processing a React component with multiple media query classes for different breakpoints.

#### Internal Logic
1. Arrange: Creates a React element with multiple breakpoint-specific background color classes.
2. Act: Calls `useTailwindStyles` with the created element and an empty config object.
3. Assert: Verifies that the returned object contains:
   - Correct inline style for the base (non-media query) class
   - Properly formatted media query strings for each breakpoint
   - List of all non-inlinable classes (those used in media queries)

| React | Used to create test components |
| Jest | Testing framework (implied by the use of `describe`, `test`, and `expect`) |

## Notes
1. The tests use an empty object (`{}`) as the second argument to `useTailwindStyles`, which represents the Tailwind configuration. In a real-world scenario, this would typically contain actual configuration options.
2. The tests focus on verifying the structure and content of the object returned by `useTailwindStyles`, ensuring that it correctly separates inline styles, media queries, and non-inlinable classes.
3. The expected RGB color values in the tests suggest that the hook is resolving Tailwind color classes to their corresponding RGB values.
4. The tests cover both simple and more complex scenarios, including nested elements and multiple breakpoints, providing good coverage of the hook's functionality.
