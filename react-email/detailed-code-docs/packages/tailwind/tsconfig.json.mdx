## High-level description
This file is a TypeScript configuration file (tsconfig.json) for a Tailwind-related package. It defines the TypeScript compiler options and specifies which files should be included or excluded from the compilation process.

## Symbols

### tsconfig.json
#### Description
This JSON configuration file sets up the TypeScript compiler options for the Tailwind package. It extends a base configuration for React libraries and adds some specific settings.

#### Internal Logic
1. The configuration uses a JSON schema for validation.
2. It extends a base configuration for React libraries.
3. It includes all files in the current directory and its subdirectories.
4. It excludes specific directories from compilation.
5. It sets compiler options for strict type checking and prevents emitting files.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| tsconfig/react-library.json | Base configuration for React libraries |

### Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| $schema | string | "https://json.schemastore.org/tsconfig" | Specifies the JSON schema for tsconfig.json validation |
| extends | string | "tsconfig/react-library.json" | Extends the base configuration for React libraries |
| include | array | ["."] | Includes all files in the current directory and subdirectories |
| exclude | array | ["dist", "build", "node_modules"] | Excludes specified directories from compilation |
| compilerOptions.strict | boolean | true | Enables strict type checking |
| compilerOptions.noEmit | boolean | true | Prevents the compiler from generating output files |

This configuration ensures that the TypeScript compiler applies strict type checking to the Tailwind package while extending a base configuration for React libraries. It includes all relevant files in the current directory and its subdirectories, excluding common output and dependency directories. The `noEmit` option is set to true, which means the compiler will only perform type checking without generating output files.
