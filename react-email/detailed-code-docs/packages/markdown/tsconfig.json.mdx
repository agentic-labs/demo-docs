title: "tsconfig.json"

## High-level description

This file is a TypeScript configuration file (`tsconfig.json`) for the markdown package. It extends a base configuration for React libraries and specifies which files to include and exclude from the TypeScript compilation process.

## Symbols

### tsconfig.json
#### Description
This JSON configuration file defines the TypeScript compiler options for the markdown package. It uses a base configuration and customizes the include and exclude paths.

#### Internal Logic
1. Extends a base configuration for React libraries.
2. Includes all files in the current directory and its subdirectories.
3. Excludes specific directories from compilation.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| tsconfig/react-library.json | Base TypeScript configuration for React libraries |

### Configuration

| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| extends | string | Specifies the base configuration file to extend |
| include | array | Defines patterns for files to include in compilation |
| exclude | array | Defines patterns for files to exclude from compilation |

## Details

1. `"extends": "tsconfig/react-library.json"`:
   - This line indicates that the current configuration extends a base configuration file named `react-library.json` located in the `tsconfig` directory.
   - The base configuration likely contains common settings for React library projects.

2. `"include": ["."]`:
   - This setting tells the TypeScript compiler to include all files in the current directory and its subdirectories.
   - The `.` represents the current directory.

3. `"exclude": ["dist", "build", "node_modules"]`:
   - This array specifies directories to exclude from the TypeScript compilation process.
   - `"dist"`: Typically contains compiled output files.
   - `"build"`: May contain build artifacts or temporary build files.
   - `"node_modules"`: Contains third-party dependencies, which should not be compiled with the project source code.

This configuration ensures that the TypeScript compiler processes all relevant source files while ignoring generated files and external dependencies. It provides a clean separation between source code and build outputs, which is essential for maintaining a well-organized project structure.
