## High-level description
This file serves as the main entry point for the markdown package. It exports all the symbols from the "markdown" module, making them available for use by other parts of the application or external consumers.

## Symbols

### `export * from "./markdown"`

#### Description
This statement performs a re-export of all named exports from the "./markdown" module. It allows consumers of this package to import symbols directly from the package root, rather than having to specify the exact file path.

## References
The code in this file references the "./markdown" module, which likely contains the main implementation of the markdown-related functionality.

## Dependencies
This file indirectly depends on the contents of the "./markdown" module. Based on the related code snippet provided, we can infer that the following symbols are likely being exported:

1. `MarkdownProps` (type)
2. `Markdown` (React component)

These symbols are defined in the related "markdown.tsx" file.

## Code Structure
This file acts as a simple re-export mechanism, centralizing the package's exports in a single location. This pattern is commonly used in JavaScript/TypeScript packages to provide a clean and consistent import experience for consumers.

By using this structure, the package maintainers have the flexibility to reorganize the internal file structure without affecting the public API, as long as they update this main entry point file accordingly.
