## High-level description
This code defines an ESLint configuration for a React-based internal package named "markdown". It extends a custom ESLint configuration specifically designed for internal React libraries.

## Code Structure
The code exports a single configuration object that extends the "custom/react-internal" ESLint configuration.

## Symbols

### module.exports
#### Description
This is the main export of the ESLint configuration file. It defines the ESLint rules and settings for the "markdown" package.

#### Inputs
N/A

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| extends | Array | An array containing the base configuration to extend |

#### Internal Logic
The configuration extends a single base configuration: "custom/react-internal". This base configuration is likely defined in a separate file and contains a set of ESLint rules tailored for internal React libraries.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| custom/react-internal | Provides the base ESLint configuration for internal React libraries |

## References
The "custom/react-internal" configuration is referenced in this file. Based on the related code snippet provided, this configuration is likely defined in the file `packages/eslint-config-custom/react-internal.js`.

## Additional Context
The related code snippet (`packages/eslint-config-custom/react-internal.js`) provides insight into the base configuration that this file extends:

1. It extends multiple configurations from the Vercel Engineering Style Guide, including browser, TypeScript, and React-specific rules.
2. It sets up parser options for TypeScript projects.
3. It configures the environment for Node.js.
4. It sets up import resolution for TypeScript projects.
5. It defines several custom rule overrides, such as disabling explicit function return types and modifying React function component definitions.

By extending this base configuration, the "markdown" package inherits all these rules and settings, ensuring consistency with other internal React libraries in the project.
