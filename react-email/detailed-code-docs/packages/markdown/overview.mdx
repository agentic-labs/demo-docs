## High-level description
The `packages/markdown` directory contains a React component for rendering Markdown content in email templates. It leverages the `md-to-react-email` library to convert Markdown syntax into JSX, ensuring compatibility with email clients and browsers. The package is designed to be used within the React Email ecosystem.

## What does it do?
This package provides a `&lt;Markdown&gt;` component that takes raw Markdown text as input and transforms it into structured HTML suitable for display in emails and web browsers. It handles various Markdown elements like headings, lists, links, and code blocks, converting them into their semantically equivalent HTML counterparts. The component also allows for customization of the rendered output through styling options, giving developers control over the final appearance of the Markdown content in their email templates.

## Key Files
1. `src/markdown.tsx`: This file contains the implementation of the `&lt;Markdown&gt;` React component. It uses the `md-to-react-email` library to parse Markdown into JSX and renders it within a `div` element. The component accepts the following props:
   - `children`: The Markdown content as a string
   - `markdownCustomStyles`: Custom styles for specific Markdown elements
   - `markdownContainerStyles`: Styles for the container `div`

2. `src/markdown.spec.tsx`: This file contains a comprehensive suite of unit tests for the `&lt;Markdown&gt;` component. It ensures that the component correctly renders various Markdown elements and maintains compatibility with email clients.

3. `package.json`: Defines the package configuration, including dependencies, scripts, and build settings. Notable aspects include:
   - Support for both CommonJS and ES Modules
   - TypeScript support
   - Peer dependency on React 18.0.0 and above

## Dependencies
- `md-to-react-email` (v5.0.2): Core library for parsing Markdown into email-compatible JSX

## Configuration
The package uses the following configuration files:
- `.eslintrc.js`: Extends the "custom/react-internal" ESLint configuration
- `tsconfig.json`: Extends a base TypeScript configuration for React libraries

The build process is configured in `package.json` using the following scripts:
- `build`: Compiles the source code for both ESM and CJS formats using `tsup`
- `dev`: Runs the build in watch mode for development
- `lint`: Runs ESLint on the project
- `test`: Executes the test suite using `vitest`
