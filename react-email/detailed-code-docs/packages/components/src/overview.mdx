## High-level description
The code exports all the components of the `@react-email` library from a central index file. This allows users to import all components from a single source, simplifying the usage of the library.

 - `@react-email/body`
 - `@react-email/button`

## Dependencies
This file, being an index file, doesn't have external dependencies. However, the components it exports have their own dependencies listed in their respective `package.json` files. For example, the `@react-email/button` component depends on `@radix-ui/react-slot` and `react`.
