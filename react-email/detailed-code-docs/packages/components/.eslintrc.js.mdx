## High-level description
This code defines the ESLint configuration for the `packages/components` directory, specifically for React code used internally within the project. It extends a custom ESLint configuration called `react-internal` which is defined in a separate file.

## References
- `custom/react-internal`: This refers to a custom ESLint configuration file that is likely located in a different directory. The exact location is determined by the ESLint resolver.

## Symbols

### `module.exports`
#### Description
This symbol defines the ESLint configuration object that will be used for the `packages/components` directory.

#### Internal Logic
The configuration object has a single property:

- `extends`: This property specifies that the configuration should extend the `custom/react-internal` configuration. This means that all the rules and settings defined in the `custom/react-internal` configuration will be inherited by this configuration.

## Dependencies
This configuration file depends on the `custom/react-internal` ESLint configuration. The exact location of this dependency is resolved by ESLint.
