title: "tsconfig.json"
---

## High-level description
This file, `tsconfig.json`, configures the TypeScript compiler for the `packages/components` directory. It specifies how TypeScript should process `.ts` and `.tsx` files within this directory to produce JavaScript output. 

## Symbols
### `extends`
#### Description
This property specifies that this configuration inherits settings from the `tsconfig/react-library.json` file. This promotes consistency and avoids redundancy in TypeScript configurations across the project.

#### Internal Logic
The compiler will first load the settings from `tsconfig/react-library.json` and then apply the settings defined in this file, potentially overriding inherited settings.

### `include`
#### Description
This property defines the files and directories that the TypeScript compiler should process. 

#### Internal Logic
- `"."`: This indicates that all files within the current directory (`packages/components`) should be included.

### `exclude`
#### Description
This property lists files and directories that the TypeScript compiler should ignore.

#### Internal Logic
- `"dist"`: Excludes the output directory for compiled JavaScript files.
- `"build"`:  Likely excludes another output or build-related directory.
- `"node_modules"`: Excludes the `node_modules` directory, which contains third-party libraries already distributed as JavaScript.
