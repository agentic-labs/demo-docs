## High-level description
The `packages/preview` directory contains the implementation of a React component called `&lt;Preview&gt;`. This component is designed to render hidden preview text for email clients, ensuring a consistent visual length by truncating long text or padding shorter text with invisible whitespace characters. The package is part of the larger `react-email` project and is intended to be used as a module in email template development.

## What does it do?
The `&lt;Preview&gt;` component takes text input and generates a visually consistent preview, typically for use in email clients. It limits the displayed text to 150 characters, truncating longer text and padding shorter text with invisible whitespace characters. This functionality is particularly useful for creating email previews with a uniform appearance across different email clients and devices.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this package is `src/index.ts`, which exports the `&lt;Preview&gt;` component and the `renderWhiteSpace` utility function. The core implementation is found in `src/preview.tsx`, which defines both the component and the utility function. Tests for these functionalities are located in `src/preview.spec.tsx`.

## Key Files
1. `src/preview.tsx`: Implements the `&lt;Preview&gt;` component and the `renderWhiteSpace` function, which form the core functionality of the package.
2. `src/preview.spec.tsx`: Contains the test suite for the `&lt;Preview&gt;` component and the `renderWhiteSpace` function, ensuring the correctness of the preview generation and whitespace padding logic.
3. `package.json`: Defines the package metadata, scripts, dependencies, and configuration for building, testing, and publishing the package.
4. `tsconfig.json`: Configures the TypeScript compiler for the package, extending a base configuration and specifying include/exclude paths.

## Dependencies
The package has the following key dependencies:
- `@react-email/render`: Used for rendering email content in the preview.
- `react`: Peer dependency for React 18 or 19, including release candidates.
- `typescript`: For TypeScript support and compilation.
- `jest`: Testing framework used in the test suite.

Development dependencies include various tools for building, linting, and type checking.

## Configuration
The package uses the following configuration files:
1. `.eslintrc.js`: Extends the `custom/react-internal` ESLint configuration, designed for internal React libraries.
2. `tsconfig.json`: Configures TypeScript compilation, extending `tsconfig/react-library.json` and specifying include/exclude paths.
3. `package.json`: Contains various scripts for building, testing, and linting, as well as configuration for publishing the package.

Key configuration points include:
- The package is published with public access.
- It supports Node.js versions 18.0.0 and above.
- The main entry point is `./dist/index.js` for CommonJS, with `./dist/index.mjs` for ES modules and `./dist/index.d.ts` for TypeScript definitions.

The `&lt;Preview&gt;` component is designed to work across various popular email clients, including Gmail, Apple Mail, Outlook, Yahoo! Mail, HEY, and Superhuman, ensuring broad compatibility for email template developers.
