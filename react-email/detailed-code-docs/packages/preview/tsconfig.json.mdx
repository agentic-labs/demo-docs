## High-level description
This file, `tsconfig.json`, configures the TypeScript compiler for the `preview` package. It specifies the TypeScript configuration to use, includes all files in the current directory, and excludes specific directories.

## Symbols
### `tsconfig.json`
#### Description
This file defines the TypeScript compiler options for the `preview` package. It extends a base configuration file (`tsconfig/react-library.json`) and customizes the include and exclude paths.

#### Inputs
N/A

#### Outputs
N/A

#### Internal Logic
- **`"extends": "tsconfig/react-library.json"`**: This line indicates that the configuration should inherit settings from the `tsconfig/react-library.json` file. This promotes reusability and consistency across different packages.
- **`"include": ["."]`**: This line specifies that the TypeScript compiler should include all files within the current directory (`.`) for compilation.
- **`"exclude": ["dist", "build", "node_modules"]`**: This line excludes the specified directories (`dist`, `build`, and `node_modules`) from the compilation process. These directories typically contain build artifacts, generated files, or external dependencies that shouldn't be compiled by TypeScript.

## Dependencies

## Configuration
