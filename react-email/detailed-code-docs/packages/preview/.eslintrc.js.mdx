## High-level description
This ESLint configuration file extends the `custom/react-internal` configuration, which is designed for internal React libraries bundled by their consumers. This suggests that the code within the `packages/preview` directory is part of such a library. 

## References
- `custom/react-internal`: This configuration is defined in the `packages/eslint-config-custom/react-internal.js` file.

## Symbols
### `module.exports`
#### Description
This symbol defines the ESLint configuration for the `packages/preview` directory by extending the `custom/react-internal` configuration.

#### Internal Logic
The code directly exports an object that extends the ESLint configuration. This means it inherits the rules and settings defined in the `custom/react-internal` configuration, which is designed for internal React libraries.
