## High-level description
This code defines the ESLint configuration for the `button` package. It extends the `custom/react-internal` ESLint configuration, inheriting its rules and settings.

## References
- `custom/react-internal`: This configuration is defined in the `packages/eslint-config-custom/react-internal.js` file.

## Symbols
### `module.exports`
#### Description
This symbol defines the ESLint configuration object that is exported from this file. It extends the `custom/react-internal` configuration, which is a custom configuration for internal React libraries used within the project.

#### Internal Logic
The configuration object has a single property:

- `extends`: This property specifies that the current configuration extends the `custom/react-internal` configuration. This means that the `button` package will inherit all the rules, settings, and plugins defined in the `custom/react-internal` configuration.
