title: "tsconfig.json"
---

## High-level description
This file, `tsconfig.json`, is a configuration file for TypeScript. It defines the TypeScript compiler options specifically for the `button` package within a larger project. It inherits base configurations from "tsconfig/react-library.json" and specifies included and excluded files for compilation.

## Symbols
There are no significant symbols in this code, as it is a configuration file.

## Dependencies
This configuration file does not explicitly list external library dependencies. However, it extends another configuration file, "tsconfig/react-library.json", which might contain dependency information.

### Configuration
This `tsconfig.json` file defines configuration options for the TypeScript compiler:

| Option    | Type   | Default | Description                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|:----------|:-------|:--------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `extends` | string | N/A     | Specifies the path to a base configuration file ("tsconfig/react-library.json") from which this configuration inherits settings. This promotes consistency and avoids redundancy in configuration across the project. |
| `include` | array  | N/A     | An array containing a single string ".", indicating that all files within the current directory should be included for compilation.                                                                                   |
| `exclude` | array  | N/A     | An array of strings specifying directories to be excluded from compilation: "dist", "build", and "node_modules". This ensures that only source files are compiled and output artifacts are not processed.           |
