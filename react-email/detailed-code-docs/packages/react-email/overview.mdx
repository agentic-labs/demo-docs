## High-level description
The `packages/react-email` directory contains the core implementation of the React Email library, which provides tools for creating, previewing, and exporting email templates using React components. It includes a command-line interface (CLI), a web-based preview application, and various utilities for rendering and managing email templates.

## What does it do?
This package enables developers to:

1. Create email templates using React components
2. Preview email templates in real-time with hot reloading
3. Export email templates to static HTML files
4. Send test emails directly from the preview interface
5. Manage and organize email templates in a structured manner
6. Build and run a local development server for email template design
7. Render email templates server-side for consistent output

## Entry points
The main entry points for the React Email library are:

1. CLI (`src/cli/index.ts`): Provides command-line tools for building, developing, exporting, and previewing email templates.
2. Preview Application (`src/app`): Implements the web-based interface for previewing and interacting with email templates.
3. Component Library (`src/components`): Offers reusable UI components for building the preview application.

## Key Files
1. `src/actions/render-email-by-path.tsx`: Handles server-side rendering of email templates.
2. `src/cli/commands/dev.ts`: Manages the development server with hot reloading functionality.
3. `src/cli/commands/export.ts`: Orchestrates the export of React Email templates to static HTML files.
4. `src/app/preview/[...slug]/preview.tsx`: Core component for the email preview interface.
5. `src/components/shell.tsx`: Defines the overall layout structure of the preview application.
6. `src/contexts/emails-context.tsx`: Provides a centralized store for email-related data and functionality.
7. `src/hooks/use-hot-reload.ts`: Implements WebSocket-based hot reloading for real-time updates.
8. `src/utils/get-email-component.ts`: Loads and processes email template files for rendering.

## Dependencies
The React Email library relies on several key dependencies:

- React and Next.js: For building the user interface and server-side rendering
- Commander.js: For implementing the CLI
- esbuild: For bundling and processing email templates
- socket.io: For real-time communication in hot reloading
- @react-email/render: For rendering React Email components into HTML
- Radix UI: For accessible UI components in the preview application
- Tailwind CSS: For styling the preview application

## Configuration
The library uses various configuration files:

1. `.eslintrc.js`: ESLint configuration for code linting
2. `.prettierrc.js`: Prettier configuration for code formatting
3. `next.config.js`: Next.js configuration for the preview application
4. `postcss.config.js`: PostCSS configuration for processing CSS
5. `tailwind.config.ts`: Tailwind CSS configuration for styling
6. `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript configuration for the project
7. `tsup.config.ts`: tsup configuration for building the CLI

Key configuration options include:

- Default email template directory: "./emails"
- Default export output directory: "out"
- Development server port: 3000 (configurable)
- Environment variables for email directory paths and other settings

The React Email library provides a powerful and flexible system for creating, previewing, and exporting email templates using React components. It offers both a command-line interface for efficient development workflows and a web-based preview application for interactive design and testing of email templates.
