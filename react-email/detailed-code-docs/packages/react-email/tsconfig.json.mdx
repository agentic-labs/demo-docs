title: "tsconfig.json"
---

## High-level description
This file is a TypeScript configuration file (tsconfig.json) for a React Email project. It sets up the TypeScript compiler options and specifies which files to include or exclude from the compilation process. The configuration is tailored for a Next.js project with specific settings for React and TypeScript.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Next.js | The configuration is set up for a Next.js project, as indicated by the "next" plugin and the inclusion of Next.js-specific files. |
| TypeScript | This is a TypeScript configuration file, used to set up the TypeScript compiler options for the project. |
| Vitest | The configuration includes types for Vitest, suggesting it's used for testing in this project. |

## Configuration
The `tsconfig.json` file contains various compiler options that control how TypeScript compiles the code. Here are some key settings:

| Option | Type | Value | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------|:------------|
| `composite` | boolean | false | Disables project references feature. |
| `esModuleInterop` | boolean | true | Enables interoperability between CommonJS and ES Modules. |
| `isolatedModules` | boolean | true | Ensures each file can be safely transpiled without relying on other imports. |
| `jsx` | string | "preserve" | Preserves JSX syntax for other tools to process. |
| `lib` | array | ["dom", "dom.iterable", "esnext"] | Specifies which library files to include in the compilation. |
| `module` | string | "CommonJS" | Sets the module system for the compiled JavaScript. |
| `target` | string | "es5" | Specifies the ECMAScript target version for the compiled JavaScript. |
| `strict` | boolean | false | Disables all strict type-checking options. |
| `noEmit` | boolean | true | Does not emit compiler output files like JavaScript source code, source-maps or declarations. |
| `outDir` | string | "dist" | Specifies the output directory for compiled files. |

The configuration also includes settings for file inclusion and exclusion:

- `include`: Specifies which files to include in the compilation. It includes TypeScript files, TypeScript React files, and Next.js type declaration files.
- `exclude`: Specifies which files or directories to exclude from the compilation. It excludes the export configuration, Next.js build output, distribution files, and node modules.

## Performance Considerations
The configuration includes several options that can affect performance:

1. `skipLibCheck: true`: This option skips type-checking of declaration files, which can speed up compilation.
2. `incremental: false`: This disables incremental compilation, which might slow down subsequent builds but ensures a clean build each time.
3. `noEmit: true`: This prevents the compiler from generating output files, which can speed up the compilation process when only type-checking is needed.

## Error Handling
The configuration includes several options related to error handling and type checking:

1. `strictNullChecks: true`: Enables strict null checks, helping to catch potential null or undefined errors.
2. `noUnusedLocals: false` and `noUnusedParameters: false`: These are set to false, allowing unused variables and parameters without raising errors.
3. `noUncheckedIndexedAccess: true`: This option adds undefined to any un-declared field in an index signature, helping to catch potential errors when accessing object properties.

These settings strike a balance between catching potential errors and allowing flexibility in the development process.
