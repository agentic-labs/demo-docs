## High-level description
This file contains a Next.js configuration module that customizes the webpack configuration and specifies package transpilation settings. It addresses specific requirements for building emails and resolves a TypeScript transpilation issue encountered when upgrading Next.js versions.

## Symbols

### module.exports
#### Description
This is the main configuration object exported for Next.js. It includes two key properties: `webpack` and `transpilePackages`.

#### Internal Logic
1. Modifies the webpack configuration to add 'esbuild' to externals for server-side builds.
2. Specifies 'react-email' package for transpilation to address a TypeScript transpilation issue.

### webpack
#### Description
A function that customizes the webpack configuration for the Next.js application, specifically for server-side builds.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| config | Object | The current webpack configuration object |
| { isServer } | Object | An object containing build context, where `isServer` is a boolean indicating if it's a server-side build |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| config | Object | The modified webpack configuration object |

#### Internal Logic
If the build is for the server-side (`isServer` is true), the function adds 'esbuild' to the `externals` array in the webpack configuration. This is necessary for proper functioning of email building code.

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| transpilePackages | Array | ['react-email'] | Specifies packages to be transpiled by Next.js |

## TODOs
- Open an issue on Next.js repository about the TypeScript transpilation problem encountered when upgrading from Next.js 14.1.1 to 14.1.2, which is related to the PR: https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/62005

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| next | Type definitions for Next.js configuration |
| webpack | Type definitions for webpack configuration |

## Performance Considerations
The configuration adds 'esbuild' to externals for server-side builds, which may affect build performance and bundle size. This should be considered when making changes to the webpack configuration.
