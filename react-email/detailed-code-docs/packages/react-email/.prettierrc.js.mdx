## High-level description
This file is a configuration file for Prettier, a popular code formatting tool. It defines specific formatting rules to be applied consistently across the codebase of the react-email package.

## Symbols

### module.exports
#### Description
This is a CommonJS module export that defines an object containing Prettier configuration options. These options customize how Prettier will format the code in the react-email package.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| module.exports | Object | An object containing Prettier configuration options |

#### Internal Logic
The configuration object sets the following Prettier options:

1. `quoteProps`: Set to 'consistent', which means Prettier will use quotes around object properties consistently based on whether any properties require quotes.
2. `singleQuote`: Set to true, which means Prettier will use single quotes for string literals instead of double quotes.
3. `trailingComma`: Set to 'all', which means Prettier will add trailing commas wherever possible in multi-line comma-separated syntactic structures.
4. `printWidth`: Set to 80, which defines the line length that Prettier will try to wrap code at.
5. `useTabs`: Set to false, which means Prettier will use spaces for indentation instead of tabs.
6. `bracketSpacing`: Set to true, which means Prettier will print spaces between brackets in object literals.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Prettier | Code formatting tool that uses this configuration file |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| quoteProps | string | 'consistent' | Controls when to quote object properties |
| singleQuote | boolean | true | Use single quotes instead of double quotes |
| trailingComma | string | 'all' | Print trailing commas wherever possible when multi-line |
| printWidth | number | 80 | Specify the line length that the printer will wrap on |
| useTabs | boolean | false | Indent with spaces instead of tabs |
| bracketSpacing | boolean | true | Print spaces between brackets in object literals |

This configuration file sets up Prettier to format code in a specific way for the react-email package. It ensures consistency in code style across the project, such as using single quotes, adding trailing commas, limiting line length to 80 characters, using spaces for indentation, and maintaining consistent spacing in object literals.
