## High-level description
The `packages/react-email/src/hooks` directory houses custom React hooks used throughout the React Email library. These hooks provide reusable logic for managing WebSocket connections, handling real-time updates, and caching rendering metadata.

## What does it do?
This directory provides functionality to connect to a live reload server via WebSockets, listen for code changes, and trigger updates in the application. It also manages and caches rendering metadata for email templates, ensuring smooth user interface updates even when errors occur during rendering.

## Key Files

### `use-hot-reload.ts`
This file defines the `useHotreload` hook, which establishes a WebSocket connection to listen for real-time code changes. When a change is detected, the hook triggers a callback function, enabling the application to update its UI accordingly. This hook is crucial for providing a live reload experience during development.

### `use-rendering-metadata.ts`
This file defines the `useRenderingMetadata` hook, which manages and returns rendering metadata for email templates. It caches successful renders and provides fallback mechanisms to handle potential rendering errors gracefully. This ensures that the user interface remains consistent and responsive even when dealing with unexpected rendering results.
