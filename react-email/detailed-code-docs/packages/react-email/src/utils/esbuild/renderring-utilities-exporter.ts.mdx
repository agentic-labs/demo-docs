## High-level description
This code defines an esbuild plugin called `renderingUtilitiesExporter` that modifies the build process for email templates. It exports the `render` function and `createElement` from the user's React version to avoid issues with multiple React versions and ensure compatibility.

## Code Structure
The main function `renderingUtilitiesExporter` returns an object with a `setup` method that configures the plugin. It uses two main esbuild hooks: `onLoad` and `onResolve` to modify the build process for email templates.

## Symbols

### `renderingUtilitiesExporter`
#### Description
This function creates an esbuild plugin that modifies the build process for email templates.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| emailTemplates | string[] | An array of file paths for email templates |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| plugin | Object | An esbuild plugin object with a `name` and `setup` method |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a regular expression to match email template file paths.
2. In the `onLoad` hook, it reads the content of the matched files and appends export statements for `render` and `createElement`.
3. In the `onResolve` hook, it attempts to resolve the `render` function from `@react-email/render` or `@react-email/components`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| node:path | For working with file paths |
| node:fs | For file system operations |
| esbuild | For build process types |

## Error Handling
The plugin includes error handling in the `onResolve` hook, providing a custom error message if neither `@react-email/render` nor `@react-email/components` can be resolved.

## References
This code references the following external modules:
- `@react-email/render`
- `@react-email/components`
- `react`

It also uses the `escapeStringForRegex` function from a local utility file.
