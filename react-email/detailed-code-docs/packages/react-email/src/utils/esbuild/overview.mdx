## High-level description
The `esbuild` directory houses utilities and plugins specifically designed for customizing the esbuild build process within the context of the React Email library. Its primary function is to ensure the correct handling and exporting of rendering utilities, particularly the `render` function and `createElement`, to prevent conflicts arising from multiple React versions.

## What does it do?
This directory provides tools to manipulate how email templates are bundled during the build process. It ensures that the correct version of React's rendering functions are accessible within the email templates, preventing issues that could arise from version mismatches or conflicting dependencies. This is crucial for maintaining compatibility and ensuring that email templates render as expected.

## Key Files
### `renderring-utilities-exporter.ts`
This file defines an esbuild plugin, `renderingUtilitiesExporter`, which is the core component of this directory. This plugin hooks into the esbuild build process and modifies how email templates are handled. It identifies email template files and injects necessary export statements for `render` and `createElement`, ensuring these functions are available during the template rendering process. This plugin also includes logic to resolve these functions from the appropriate source, either `@react-email/render` or `@react-email/components`, and provides error handling in case of resolution failures.

### `escape-string-for-regex.ts`
This file provides a utility function, `escapeStringForRegex`, which escapes special characters in strings to make them safe for use in regular expressions. This function is used within the `renderingUtilitiesExporter` plugin to safely construct a regular expression for identifying email template files based on their file paths.

## Dependencies
- **node:path:** Used for path manipulation when working with file paths, particularly within the `renderingUtilitiesExporter` plugin for identifying email template files.
- **node:fs:**  Used for file system operations, specifically for reading the content of email template files within the `onLoad` hook of the `renderingUtilitiesExporter` plugin.
- **esbuild:** Provides the necessary types and interfaces for interacting with the esbuild build process. This dependency is crucial for defining and implementing the custom esbuild plugin.
- **@react-email/render:** This module is the preferred source for the `render` function. The `renderingUtilitiesExporter` plugin attempts to resolve this function from this module first.
- **@react-email/components:** If `@react-email/render` is not available, the plugin attempts to resolve the `render` function from this module as a fallback.
- **react:** This dependency is implicitly used as the source of the `createElement` function, which is also exported by the plugin.
