## High-level description
This code defines a constant object `tabTransition` that specifies animation properties for tab transitions. It's used to create smooth and responsive animations in the React Email application's user interface.

### `tabTransition`
#### Description
`tabTransition` is a constant object that defines the properties for a spring animation. It's used to control the behavior of tab transitions in the user interface.

#### Inputs
This is a constant, so it doesn't have inputs.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| tabTransition | Object | An object containing animation properties |

#### Internal Logic
The `tabTransition` object contains four properties:
1. `type`: Set to 'spring', indicating a spring-based animation.
2. `stiffness`: Set to 2000, controlling the tension of the spring.
3. `damping`: Set to 80, controlling how quickly the animation settles.
4. `mass`: Set to 1, representing the weight of the animated object.

These values are carefully chosen to create a quick, responsive animation with a slight bounce effect.

## References
The `tabTransition` constant is used in other parts of the application:

1. In `code-container.tsx`, it's used for animating the active language tab in the code display.
2. In `topbar.tsx`, it's used for animating the active view tab in the top bar of the application.

## Dependencies
This code doesn't have any external dependencies. It's a simple JavaScript object definition.

## Performance Considerations
The chosen values for the spring animation properties (high stiffness, moderate damping, and low mass) are optimized for quick, responsive transitions. This should result in smooth animations that feel snappy and don't introduce noticeable lag in the user interface.
