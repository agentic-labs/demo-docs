## High-level description
This code defines a TypeScript type `HotReloadEvent` that represents different events that can occur during hot reloading in a development environment. It provides a set of string literal types for various file system events.

## Symbols

### `HotReloadEvent`
#### Description
`HotReloadEvent` is a union type that defines the possible events that can occur during hot reloading. These events correspond to file system changes that might trigger a reload or update in the development environment.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| HotReloadEvent | Union of string literals | Represents different hot reload events |

#### Internal Logic
The `HotReloadEvent` type is defined as a union of five string literal types:
1. `'add'`: Represents the addition of a new file.
2. `'addDir'`: Represents the addition of a new directory.
3. `'change'`: Represents a change in an existing file.
4. `'unlink'`: Represents the removal of a file.
5. `'unlinkDir'`: Represents the removal of a directory.

## References
The `HotReloadEvent` type is referenced in the related file `hot-reload-change.ts`, where it is used as part of the `HotReloadChange` interface. This suggests that `HotReloadEvent` is likely used in a broader context for handling file system changes in a hot-reloading scenario.

## Dependencies
This code does not have any external dependencies. It uses only TypeScript's built-in type system features.
