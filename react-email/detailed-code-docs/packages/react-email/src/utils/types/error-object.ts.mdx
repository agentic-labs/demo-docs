## High-level description
This code defines an `ErrorObject` interface that mimics the structure of the JavaScript `Error` class. It's designed to be used in server actions where returning actual `Error` instances is not possible.

## Symbols

### `ErrorObject`
#### Description
The `ErrorObject` interface defines a structure that resembles the standard JavaScript `Error` class. It's used to represent errors in a format that can be safely returned from server actions.

#### Inputs
This is an interface definition, so it doesn't have inputs in the traditional sense. Instead, it defines the structure of an object.

#### Outputs
The interface defines an object with the following properties:

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| name | string | The name of the error |
| stack | string \| undefined | The stack trace of the error, if available |
| cause | unknown | The cause of the error, if any |
| message | string | The error message |

## Dependencies
This file doesn't have any external dependencies. It's a standalone TypeScript interface definition.

## References
The `ErrorObject` interface is referenced in other parts of the codebase:

1. In `packages/react-email/src/actions/render-email-by-path.tsx`, it's used in the `EmailRenderingResult` type to represent potential errors during email rendering.

2. In `packages/react-email/src/utils/improve-error-with-sourcemap.ts`, it's the return type of the `improveErrorWithSourceMap` function, which enhances error information with source map data.

3. In `packages/react-email/src/app/preview/[...slug]/rendering-error.tsx`, it's used as a prop type for the `RenderingError` component, which displays error information in the UI.

## Side Effects
As this is a type definition, it has no side effects. It's used purely for TypeScript type checking and doesn't affect runtime behavior.

## Performance Considerations
Type definitions like this have no runtime performance impact. They are used by TypeScript during compilation and are erased in the resulting JavaScript code.

This interface provides a consistent structure for error objects across the application, enabling better error handling and reporting, especially in scenarios where actual `Error` instances cannot be used, such as in server actions.
