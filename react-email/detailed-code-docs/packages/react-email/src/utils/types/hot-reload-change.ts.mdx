## High-level description
This code defines the `HotReloadChange` interface, which represents a change event in a hot-reloading system. It combines a filename with a specific hot reload event type, providing a structure for tracking file changes during development.

### `HotReloadChange`
#### Description
The `HotReloadChange` interface defines the structure for representing a change in the hot-reloading system. It combines the filename of the changed file with the type of event that occurred.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| filename | string | The name or path of the file that changed |
| event | HotReloadEvent | The type of event that occurred (e.g., 'add', 'change', 'unlink') |

## References
- `HotReloadEvent`: This type is imported from './hot-reload-event' and used to define the `event` property of the `HotReloadChange` interface.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| './hot-reload-event' | Imports the `HotReloadEvent` type used in the `HotReloadChange` interface |

## Related Code Context
The `HotReloadChange` interface is used in other parts of the codebase, particularly in the hot-reloading system:

1. In `setup-hot-reloading.ts`, it's used to track changes in the file system and send them to connected clients.
2. In `use-hot-reload.ts`, it's used as part of the callback function type for the `useHotreload` hook, which handles reloading based on these change events.

The `HotReloadEvent` type, imported from 'hot-reload-event.ts', defines the possible values for the `event` property:
- 'add': A new file is added
- 'addDir': A new directory is added
- 'change': An existing file is modified
- 'unlink': A file is removed
- 'unlinkDir': A directory is removed

This interface plays a crucial role in the hot-reloading system, providing a standardized way to represent and communicate file changes across different parts of the application.
