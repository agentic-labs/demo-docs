## High-level description
This code defines a utility function `cn` that combines class names using the `clsx` library and merges them with Tailwind CSS classes using `tailwind-merge`. It provides a convenient way to conditionally apply and merge CSS classes in React components.

## Symbols

### `cn`
#### Description
The `cn` function is a utility that combines multiple class names and merges them with Tailwind CSS classes. It uses `clsx` to handle conditional class names and `tailwind-merge` to resolve conflicts between Tailwind CSS classes.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ...inputs | ClassValue[] | A rest parameter that accepts any number of arguments of type ClassValue (defined by clsx) |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mergedClasses | string | A string of merged and deduplicated class names |

#### Internal Logic
1. The function uses the spread operator to accept any number of arguments.
2. It passes these arguments to `clsx`, which combines them into a single string of class names.
3. The result is then passed to `twMerge`, which merges and deduplicates Tailwind CSS classes.
4. The final merged and deduplicated string of class names is returned.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| clsx | Used for conditionally joining class names together |
| tailwind-merge | Used for merging Tailwind CSS classes and resolving conflicts |

## References
This utility is imported and used in other parts of the codebase, as evidenced by its export in the `packages/react-email/src/utils/index.ts` file.

## Performance Considerations
The `cn` function is designed to be efficient for combining and merging class names. However, it's worth noting that excessive use of this function with large numbers of class names could potentially impact performance in highly dynamic scenarios.
