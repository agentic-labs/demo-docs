## High-level description
This code defines a function `improveErrorWithSourceMap` that enhances error information by using source maps. It takes an error, the original file path, and a source map, and returns an improved error object with a more accurate stack trace that points to the original source locations.

## Code Structure
The main function `improveErrorWithSourceMap` uses helper functions and external libraries to parse the error stack, apply source map transformations, and generate an improved error object.

## References
This code references the `ErrorObject` type from './types/error-object'.

## Symbols

### `improveErrorWithSourceMap`
#### Description
This function takes an error, the original file path, and a source map, and returns an improved error object with a more accurate stack trace.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| error | Error | The original error object |
| originalFilePath | string | The path to the original source file |
| sourceMapToOriginalFile | RawSourceMap | The source map for the original file |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ErrorObject | object | An improved error object with a more accurate stack trace |

#### Internal Logic
1. Determine the source root from the source map or the original file path.
2. Define a helper function `getStackLineFromMethodNameAndSource` to format stack trace lines.
3. If the error has a stack trace:
   a. Parse the stack trace using `stackTraceParser`.
   b. Create a `SourceMapConsumer` from the provided source map.
   c. Iterate through each stack frame:
      - If the frame is from the original file, use the source map to get the original position.
      - Generate a new stack line using the helper function.
   d. Join the new stack lines to create the improved stack trace.
4. Return an `ErrorObject` with the improved stack trace and other error properties.

### `getStackLineFromMethodNameAndSource`
#### Description
A helper function that formats a single line of the stack trace.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
| methodName | string | The name of the method in the stack frame |
| source | string | The source file path |
| line | number \| undefined \| null | The line number |
| column | number \| undefined \| null | The column number |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| stackLine | string | A formatted stack trace line |

#### Internal Logic
1. Format the column and line information if available.
2. Get the relative path of the source file.
3. Return a formatted string based on whether the method name is known or unknown.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| node:path | For working with file paths |
| stacktrace-parser | For parsing error stack traces |
| source-map-js | For working with source maps |

## Error Handling
The code doesn't implement specific error handling mechanisms beyond improving the existing error information.

## Performance Considerations
The function performs source map lookups for each relevant stack frame, which could be computationally expensive for large stack traces or complex source maps. However, this is typically only done in error scenarios, so the performance impact during normal operation should be minimal.
