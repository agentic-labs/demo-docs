## High-level description
This file serves as an index for utility functions and types used in the react-email package. It exports various utility functions and types from different files, making them easily accessible throughout the project.

## Code Structure
The file uses ES6 export syntax to re-export all exports from five different utility files. This structure allows for centralized access to utility functions and types, promoting better organization and easier imports in other parts of the project.

## Symbols

### Export statements
#### Description
The file contains five export statements, each exporting all symbols from a specific utility file.

1. `export * from './types/as';`
   Exports the `As` type, which is a utility type for component props with different element types.

2. `export * from './cn';`
   Exports the `cn` function, which is a utility for merging class names.

3. `export * from './copy-text-to-clipboard';`
   Exports a function for copying text to the clipboard (implementation not provided in the snippets).

4. `export * from './language-map';`
   Exports the `languageMap` object, which maps file extensions to human-readable language names.

5. `export * from './unreachable';`
   Exports the `unreachable` function, which is used for handling unreachable code paths.

## Dependencies
The file itself doesn't have direct dependencies, but it re-exports from files that depend on external libraries:

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| clsx | Used in the `cn` function for conditional class name joining |
| tailwind-merge | Used in the `cn` function for merging Tailwind CSS classes |
| React | Used in the `As` type definition |

## References
This file is likely referenced by other parts of the react-email package that need to use these utility functions and types. The centralized export makes it easier for other modules to import multiple utilities with a single import statement.

## Additional Notes on Exported Utilities

### As Type (from './types/as')
The `As` type is a complex generic type that allows for flexible component props typing with different element types. It's useful for creating polymorphic components in React.

### cn Function (from './cn')
The `cn` function combines `clsx` and `tailwind-merge` to provide a utility for merging class names, particularly useful when working with Tailwind CSS classes.

### languageMap (from './language-map')
This object provides a mapping of file extensions to human-readable language names, which can be useful for displaying or processing different types of code.

### unreachable Function (from './unreachable')
This function is used to handle theoretically unreachable code paths. It throws a TypeError with a customizable message, which can be helpful for type checking and runtime error detection.

By centralizing these utilities in a single export file, the react-email package maintains a clean and organized structure, making it easier for developers to locate and use these common utilities throughout the project.
