## High-level description
This code is a unit test for the `getEmailComponent` function. It tests the function's ability to load and render an email template from a specified file path, ensuring that the component is correctly loaded, and its rendered output matches the expected snapshot.

## Symbols

### `test('getEmailComponent() with a demo email template', async () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
This is the main test function that verifies the behavior of the `getEmailComponent` function when provided with a demo email template.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls `getEmailComponent` with a resolved path to a demo email template.
2. Checks if the result contains an error. If so, it logs the error and expects the test to fail.
3. If no error, it verifies that the `emailComponent` and `sourceMapToOriginalFile` properties exist in the result.
4. Renders the email component using the provided `render` and `createElement` functions.
5. Compares the rendered HTML with a snapshot to ensure consistency.

#### Performance Considerations
The test uses `async/await`, which is appropriate for testing asynchronous functions like `getEmailComponent`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| path | Used to resolve file paths |
| getEmailComponent | The main function being tested |

## References
The test references the following external components:
- `getEmailComponent` function from './get-email-component'
- A demo email template located at '../../../../apps/demo/emails/notifications/vercel-invite-user.tsx'

## Error Handling
The test includes basic error handling:
- If the `getEmailComponent` function returns an error, it logs the error and expects the test to fail.
- If no error is returned, it proceeds with further assertions.

## Notes
1. The test uses Jest's snapshot testing feature (`expect(emailHtml).toMatchSnapshot()`), which is useful for detecting unintended changes in the rendered output.
2. The test doesn't explicitly mock any dependencies, suggesting that it might be an integration test that relies on the actual implementation of `getEmailComponent` and the presence of the demo email template file.
3. The test doesn't cover all possible scenarios or edge cases, focusing only on the happy path where the email component is successfully loaded and rendered.

This test serves as a basic sanity check for the `getEmailComponent` function, ensuring that it can successfully load and render a demo email template. It's a good starting point, but more comprehensive tests might be needed to cover various edge cases and error scenarios.
