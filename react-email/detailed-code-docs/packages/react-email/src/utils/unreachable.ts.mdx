## High-level description
The `unreachable` function is a utility designed to handle unreachable code paths in TypeScript. It throws a TypeError with a customizable message when invoked, serving as a safeguard against unexpected code execution and aiding in type narrowing.

## Symbols

### `unreachable`
#### Description
This function is used to handle cases that should never occur in the program's execution. It's particularly useful in exhaustive switch statements or to satisfy TypeScript's type checking in scenarios where all possible cases are believed to be covered.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| condition | string \| Record&lt;string, unknown&gt; | The unexpected value that led to the unreachable code |
| message | string | Optional custom error message (default is dynamically generated) |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| - | never | This function never returns as it always throws an error |

#### Internal Logic
1. The function constructs an error message, either using the provided custom message or generating one based on the `condition` parameter.
2. If `condition` is a string, it's used directly in the message.
3. If `condition` is an object, it's stringified using `JSON.stringify()`.
4. The function throws a `TypeError` with the constructed message.

## Side Effects
This function always throws a `TypeError` when called, halting the execution of the current code path.

## Usage Examples
The `unreachable` function is used in several related files:

1. In `heading.tsx`, `button.tsx`, and `text.tsx`, it's used in switch statements to handle unexpected values for size, color, weight, or appearance properties.

2. Example from `heading.tsx`:
   ```typescript
   default:
     return unreachable(size);
   ```

3. This usage ensures that if a new size, color, or weight is added to the type definition but not handled in the switch statement, TypeScript will raise a compile-time error.

## Error Handling
The primary purpose of this function is error handling. It's designed to be used in situations where the code should never be reached. When called, it throws a `TypeError` with a descriptive message, helping developers quickly identify and fix logical errors or incomplete implementations.

## Performance Considerations
While the function itself is lightweight, its use in frequently executed code paths should be considered carefully, as throwing errors can be relatively expensive in terms of performance. However, in most cases where it's used (switch statements in component rendering), the performance impact should be negligible as these are typically one-time operations during component initialization or updates.
