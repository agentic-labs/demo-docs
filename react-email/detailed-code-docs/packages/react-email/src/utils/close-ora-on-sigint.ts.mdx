title: "close-ora-on-sigint.ts"
---

## High-level description
This code implements a utility function to gracefully handle the termination of spinner animations when the process receives a SIGINT signal (typically triggered by Ctrl+C). It ensures that all active spinners are stopped before the process exits.

## Code Structure
The code defines a `Set` to keep track of active spinners and sets up a SIGINT event listener to stop these spinners. It also exports a function `closeOraOnSIGNIT` to add spinners to this set.

## Symbols

### `spinners`
#### Description
A `Set` that stores active `Ora` spinner instances.

#### Internal Logic
The `Set` is used to keep track of all active spinners, allowing for efficient addition and iteration.

### `process.on('SIGINT', ...)`
#### Description
An event listener that responds to the SIGINT signal.

#### Internal Logic
When a SIGINT signal is received, it iterates through all spinners in the `spinners` set and stops any that are currently spinning.

### `closeOraOnSIGNIT`
#### Description
A function that adds a given spinner to the `spinners` set.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| spinner | Ora | The spinner instance to be added to the set |

#### Internal Logic
Simply adds the provided spinner to the `spinners` set.

## Side Effects
- Modifies the global `process` object by adding a SIGINT event listener.
- Stops active spinners when a SIGINT signal is received.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ora | Type definition for Ora spinner instances |

## Error Handling
This code doesn't implement explicit error handling. It assumes that the `Ora` spinner instances have a valid `isSpinning` property and `stop()` method.

## Performance Considerations
Using a `Set` for storing spinners ensures efficient addition and iteration operations, which is important for responsiveness when handling the SIGINT signal.

This utility is particularly useful in CLI applications that use spinner animations to indicate progress, ensuring a clean shutdown when the user interrupts the process.
