## High-level description
This code defines a simple mapping between file extensions and their corresponding language names. It's used to provide human-readable labels for different code languages in a user interface.

## Symbols

### `languageMap`
#### Description
`languageMap` is a constant object that maps file extensions to their corresponding language names.

#### Inputs
This is a constant object, so it doesn't have inputs in the traditional sense.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| languageMap | Object | An object with key-value pairs mapping file extensions to language names |

#### Internal Logic
The object contains three key-value pairs:
1. 'jsx' is mapped to 'React'
2. 'markup' is mapped to 'HTML'
3. 'markdown' is mapped to 'Plain Text'

## Dependencies
This file doesn't have any external dependencies.

## References
The `languageMap` object is imported and used in the `CodeContainer` component (packages/react-email/src/components/code-container.tsx). It's used to display human-readable language names in the UI for different code snippets.

In the `CodeContainer` component, `languageMap` is used in the following context:
```typescript
{languageMap[language]}
```
This line renders the human-readable language name for each language tab in the code container.

## Notes
1. The mapping is currently limited to three languages. If more languages need to be supported in the future, they would need to be added to this object.
2. The keys in the object correspond to the `language` property of the `MarkupProps` interface in the `CodeContainer` component.
3. This simple key-value structure allows for easy lookup of language names based on their file extensions or identifiers.

By exporting this object as the default export, it can be easily imported and used in other parts of the application where language names need to be displayed based on file extensions or language identifiers.
