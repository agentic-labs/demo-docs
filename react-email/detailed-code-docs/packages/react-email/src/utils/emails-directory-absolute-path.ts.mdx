## High-level description
This code defines and exports three environment variables related to email directory paths. These variables are intended to be used only on the server-side and provide absolute and relative paths for the email directory and the user's project location.

## Symbols

### `emailsDirRelativePath`
#### Description
This constant represents the relative path to the emails directory.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| EMAILS_DIR_RELATIVE_PATH | string | Environment variable containing the relative path to the emails directory |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| emailsDirRelativePath | string | The relative path to the emails directory |

### `userProjectLocation`
#### Description
This constant represents the absolute path to the user's project location.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| USER_PROJECT_LOCATION | string | Environment variable containing the absolute path to the user's project location |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| userProjectLocation | string | The absolute path to the user's project location |

### `emailsDirectoryAbsolutePath`
#### Description
This constant represents the absolute path to the emails directory.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| EMAILS_DIR_ABSOLUTE_PATH | string | Environment variable containing the absolute path to the emails directory |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| emailsDirectoryAbsolutePath | string | The absolute path to the emails directory |

## Side Effects
This code relies on environment variables being set correctly. If these variables are not set or are set incorrectly, it may lead to runtime errors when accessing these constants.

## Dependencies
This code doesn't have any external dependencies beyond the Node.js `process` object, which is used to access environment variables.

## Error Handling
The code uses the non-null assertion operator (`!`) for all three constants, which means it assumes these environment variables will always be set. If they are not set, this could lead to runtime errors.

## References
The `emailsDirectoryAbsolutePath` constant is used in several other parts of the codebase:

1. In `get-email-path-from-slug.ts` to construct the full path to email files.
2. In `page.tsx` (preview) to get metadata about the emails directory.
3. In `sidebar-directory-children.tsx` to determine if the current directory is the base emails directory.
4. In `layout.tsx` to get metadata about the emails directory.
5. In `page.tsx` (home) to display the base emails directory name.

These usages indicate that `emailsDirectoryAbsolutePath` is a crucial piece of configuration for the React Email preview functionality, used to locate and manage email templates.

## TODOs
Consider adding error checking or default values for these environment variables to make the code more robust against missing configurations.
