Here's a detailed documentation of the `get-email-component.ts` file:

## High-level description
This file exports a function `getEmailComponent` that loads and processes an email template file, bundles it using esbuild, and returns the email component along with rendering utilities. It's designed to work with React-based email templates.

## Code Structure
The main function `getEmailComponent` uses esbuild to bundle the email template and then executes the bundled code in a sandboxed environment using Node.js's `vm` module. It returns either the email component with rendering utilities or an error object if the process fails.

## Symbols

### `getEmailComponent`
#### Description
Asynchronous function that loads, bundles, and processes an email template file.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| emailPath | string | The file path of the email template to be processed |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Object | Contains either the email component and rendering utilities, or an error object |

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses esbuild to bundle the email template file
2. Creates a sandboxed environment using Node.js `vm` module
3. Executes the bundled code in the sandboxed environment
4. Returns the email component, rendering utilities, and source map, or an error object if any step fails

## Dependencies
- `node:path`: For handling file paths
- `node:vm`: For creating a sandboxed execution environment
- `esbuild`: For bundling the email template
- `source-map-js`: For handling source maps
- Custom utility functions and types from local files

## Error Handling
The function uses try-catch blocks to handle errors during the bundling and execution processes. If an error occurs, it returns an object with an `error` property containing details about the error.

## Performance Considerations
The function uses esbuild for fast bundling of the email template. However, the use of `vm.runInNewContext` for executing the bundled code in a sandboxed environment may have some performance overhead.

## Side Effects
- Reads and processes files from the file system
- Executes potentially untrusted code in a sandboxed environment

## Configuration
The function uses several esbuild options for bundling, including:
- `bundle: true`
- `platform: 'node'`
- `format: 'cjs'`
- `jsx: 'automatic'`
- `sourcemap: 'external'`

These options are crucial for correctly processing React-based email templates.
