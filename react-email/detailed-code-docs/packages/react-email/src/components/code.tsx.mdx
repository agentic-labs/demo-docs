## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `Code` that renders syntax-highlighted code blocks using the `prism-react-renderer` library. It supports multiple programming languages and applies custom styling to the code blocks.

## Code Structure
The main `Code` component uses the `Highlight` component from `prism-react-renderer` to render the code. It also defines a custom theme for syntax highlighting and handles special cases for certain languages.

## Symbols

### `Code`
#### Description
A React functional component that renders syntax-highlighted code blocks.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| children | string | The code to be displayed and highlighted |
| language | Language (optional) | The programming language of the code (default: 'html') |

#### Internal Logic
1. Trims the input code.
2. Uses `Highlight` component to render the code with syntax highlighting.
3. Applies custom styling to the code block.
4. Handles special cases for the 'bash' language and 'from:' tokens.
5. Renders decorative gradient lines at the top and bottom of the code block.

### `theme`
#### Description
An object that defines the custom styling for the syntax highlighting.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| prism-react-renderer | Provides the `Highlight` component and `Language` type for syntax highlighting |
| react | Core React library |
| ../utils | Imports the `cn` utility function for class name concatenation |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| language | Language | 'html' | The programming language of the code block |

## Performance Considerations
The component uses `React.FC` with `Readonly` type to optimize for immutability and prevent accidental mutations of props.

## Side Effects
The component creates gradient effects using absolute positioning, which may affect the layout of parent components if not properly contained.

This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the `Code` component, its functionality, and its implementation details. The component is designed to be used within a larger React application, likely as part of a documentation or code presentation feature.
