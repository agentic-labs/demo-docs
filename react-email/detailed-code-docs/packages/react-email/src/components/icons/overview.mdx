## High-level description
This directory contains a collection of React components that render SVG icons. These icons are designed for use in a web application and cover a range of common actions and concepts. Each icon component is built upon a base component (`IconBase`) to ensure consistency in styling and behavior.

## What does it do?
This directory houses a library of icons for a web application. Each icon is a small, reusable piece of code that displays a simple graphic, like a folder, a phone, or a download arrow. These icons are designed to be visually consistent and can be easily incorporated into different parts of the application.

## Key Files
### icon-base.tsx
This file defines the `IconBase` component, which serves as the foundation for all other icon components in the directory. It provides a common structure for rendering SVG icons, handling properties like size, color, and accessibility attributes.

### Other Icon Components
The remaining files in the directory (e.g., `icon-arrow-down.tsx`, `icon-clipboard.tsx`, `icon-file.tsx`) each define a specific icon component. These components build upon `IconBase`, inheriting its properties and functionality, and add the unique SVG path data that defines the visual representation of the specific icon. For example, `icon-arrow-down.tsx` defines the path for a downward-pointing arrow, while `icon-file.tsx` defines the path for a file icon.
