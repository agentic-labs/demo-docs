## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `IconDownload`, which renders a download icon using SVG paths. It's part of a larger icon system, utilizing a base icon component for consistent styling and behavior.

## Code Structure
The `IconDownload` component is built on top of the `IconBase` component, which provides common SVG properties and forwarding of refs. The `IconDownload` component adds specific path data to create the download icon visual.

## References
- `IconBase` from './icon-base'
- React's `forwardRef` API

### IconDownload
#### Description
A React component that renders a download icon using SVG paths. It uses the `IconBase` component for common SVG properties and forwards refs to allow parent components to access the underlying DOM element.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| props | IconProps | SVG properties inherited from IconBase |
| forwardedRef | React.Ref&lt;IconElement&gt; | Forwarded ref for accessing the SVG element |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSX.Element | React.ReactElement | The rendered download icon SVG |

#### Internal Logic
1. The component uses `React.forwardRef` to handle ref forwarding.
2. It renders an `IconBase` component, passing through all props and the forwarded ref.
3. Inside `IconBase`, it defines a `path` element with specific attributes to create the download icon visual.
4. The icon uses `currentColor` for its stroke, allowing for easy color customization through CSS.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| React | Core library for building the component |
| IconBase | Base component for consistent icon styling and behavior |

## Performance Considerations
The use of `React.forwardRef` allows for efficient ref forwarding, which can be beneficial when integrating this icon component into larger component systems or when direct DOM access is needed.
