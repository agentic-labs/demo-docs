## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `IconFolderOpen`, which renders an SVG icon of an open folder. It utilizes the `IconBase` component to provide a consistent base for all icons in the application, while adding specific path details for the open folder icon.

## Code Structure
The `IconFolderOpen` component is built on top of the `IconBase` component, inheriting its properties and functionality. It uses React's `forwardRef` to allow ref forwarding, enabling the icon to be used in various contexts within the application.

## References
- `IconBase` from './icon-base'
- `IconProps` and `IconElement` types from './icon-base'

### IconFolderOpen
#### Description
A React component that renders an SVG icon of an open folder. It uses the `IconBase` component and adds a specific SVG path for the open folder shape.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| props | Readonly&lt;IconProps&gt; | Props inherited from IconProps, including size and other SVG attributes |

#### Outputs
Returns a React element representing the open folder icon.

#### Internal Logic
1. The component uses `React.forwardRef` to allow ref forwarding.
2. It spreads the received props onto the `IconBase` component.
3. Inside `IconBase`, it defines an SVG path with specific attributes for the open folder shape.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| React | For creating the functional component and using forwardRef |
| IconBase | Provides the base SVG structure for the icon |
| IconProps, IconElement | Type definitions for the component props and ref |

## Performance Considerations
The use of `React.forwardRef` allows for efficient ref handling, which can be beneficial when integrating this icon into larger component structures or when direct DOM access is needed.

## API/Interface Reference
The `IconFolderOpen` component accepts all standard SVG attributes as props, inherited from `IconProps`. The most commonly used prop is:

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| size | number | 20 | Sets the width and height of the icon |

Note: Other SVG attributes can be passed as props and will be applied to the underlying SVG element.
