## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `IconSource` that renders an SVG icon representing a source or code symbol. It utilizes the `IconBase` component to provide a consistent base for all icons in the application.

## Code Structure
The `IconSource` component is built on top of the `IconBase` component, which provides the basic SVG structure. The `IconSource` component adds a specific path to create the visual representation of a source code icon.

## References
- `IconBase` from './icon-base'
- `IconProps` type from './icon-base'
- `IconElement` type from './icon-base'

## Symbols

### IconSource
#### Description
A React component that renders an SVG icon representing a source code symbol. It uses the `IconBase` component and adds a specific path to create the visual representation.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| props | IconProps | Props inherited from IconBase, including size and other SVG attributes |

#### Outputs
Returns a React element representing the IconSource SVG.

#### Internal Logic
1. The component is defined using `React.forwardRef` to allow ref forwarding.
2. It spreads the received props to the `IconBase` component.
3. Inside `IconBase`, it defines a `path` element with specific attributes to create the source code icon shape.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| React | For creating the functional component and using forwardRef |
| IconBase | Provides the base SVG structure for the icon |

## Performance Considerations
The use of `React.forwardRef` allows for efficient ref forwarding, which can be beneficial when the icon needs to be directly manipulated or measured in the parent component.
