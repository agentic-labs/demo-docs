## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `IconCheck` that renders a checkmark icon. It utilizes the `IconBase` component to create a consistent base for icons and adds a specific SVG path to represent the checkmark.

## Code Structure
The `IconCheck` component is built on top of the `IconBase` component, which provides a standardized structure for icons. The `IconCheck` component adds the specific SVG path for the checkmark icon.

## References
- `IconBase` from './icon-base'
- `IconProps` and `IconElement` types from './icon-base'

### IconCheck
#### Description
`IconCheck` is a React component that renders a checkmark icon. It uses the `React.forwardRef` to allow ref forwarding to the underlying `IconBase` component.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| props | IconProps | Props inherited from IconProps, excluding 'size' |
| forwardedRef | React.Ref&lt;IconElement&gt; | Forwarded ref for the icon element |

#### Outputs
Returns a React element representing the checkmark icon.

#### Internal Logic
1. The component spreads any additional props to the `IconBase` component.
2. It defines an SVG path for the checkmark shape inside the `IconBase`.
3. The path uses `currentColor` for the stroke, allowing for easy color customization.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| React | For creating the functional component and using forwardRef |
| IconBase | Provides the base structure for the icon |
| IconProps, IconElement | Type definitions for the component props and ref |

## Notes
- The component uses `React.forwardRef` to allow passing refs to the underlying `IconBase` component.
- The `displayName` is set to 'IconCheck' for better debugging and development tools support.
- The SVG path is designed to create a checkmark shape within a 24x24 viewBox.
- The icon uses `strokeLinecap="round"` and `strokeLinejoin="round"` for smooth corners and line endings.
- The `strokeWidth` is set to 1.5, providing a consistent line thickness for the icon.

This component is likely part of a larger icon system in the application, where various icons are created using the same pattern with `IconBase` as the foundation.
