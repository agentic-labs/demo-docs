## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `IconArrowDown`, which renders an SVG icon of a downward-pointing arrow. It's part of a larger icon system and is designed to be customizable and reusable across the application.

## Code Structure
The `IconArrowDown` component is built on top of the `IconBase` component, which provides common SVG properties and functionality. The `IconArrowDown` component adds a specific path for the arrow shape.

## References
- `IconBase` from './icon-base'
- React's `forwardRef` function

### IconArrowDown
#### Description
`IconArrowDown` is a React component that renders a downward-pointing arrow icon. It uses the `IconBase` component as a foundation and adds a specific SVG path for the arrow shape.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| props | IconProps | Props inherited from IconBase, including size and other SVG attributes |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| - | React.ReactElement | An SVG element representing the down arrow icon |

#### Internal Logic
1. The component is created using `React.forwardRef` to allow ref forwarding to the underlying SVG element.
2. It spreads any additional props to the `IconBase` component.
3. Inside `IconBase`, it defines a `path` element with the specific shape of the down arrow.
4. The `fill` attribute of the path is set to "currentColor", allowing the icon color to be inherited from its parent.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| React | For creating the component |
| IconBase | Provides base SVG properties and functionality |

## Configuration
The icon can be customized using the following prop:
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| size | number | 20 | Sets the width and height of the icon |

Note: Other SVG attributes can also be passed as props and will be applied to the `IconBase` component.

## Usage Example
```jsx
&lt;IconArrowDown size={24} color="blue" /&gt;
```

This would render a blue down arrow icon with a size of 24x24 pixels.
