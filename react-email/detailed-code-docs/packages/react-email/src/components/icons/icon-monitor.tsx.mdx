## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `IconMonitor`, which renders an SVG icon of a monitor. It utilizes the `IconBase` component to provide a consistent base for all icons in the application.

## Code Structure
The `IconMonitor` component is built on top of the `IconBase` component, which provides common SVG properties and styling. The `IconMonitor` component adds a specific path to create the monitor icon.

## References
- `IconBase` from './icon-base'
- `IconProps` and `IconElement` types from './icon-base'

### IconMonitor
#### Description
A React component that renders an SVG icon of a monitor. It uses the `forwardRef` to allow ref forwarding to the underlying SVG element.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| props | IconProps | Props inherited from IconProps, including size and other SVG attributes |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| - | React.ForwardRefExoticComponent | A React component that renders the monitor icon |

#### Internal Logic
1. The component spreads any additional props to the `IconBase` component.
2. It defines a `path` element within the `IconBase` to create the monitor icon shape.
3. The `path` uses `stroke="currentColor"` to inherit the color from its parent.
4. The icon's shape is defined using SVG path commands.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| React | For creating the functional component and using `forwardRef` |
| IconBase | Provides the base SVG structure for the icon |

## API/Interface Reference
The `IconMonitor` component can be used as follows:
```jsx
&lt;IconMonitor size={24} color="blue" /&gt;
```
It accepts all standard SVG attributes as props, with `size` being a custom prop to set both width and height simultaneously.
