## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `IconHideSidebar`, which renders an SVG icon representing a "hide sidebar" action. The component is built using the `IconBase` component and includes SVG path elements to create the icon's visual representation.

## Code Structure
The `IconHideSidebar` component is created using `React.forwardRef` to allow ref forwarding. It utilizes the `IconBase` component to provide the basic SVG structure and adds specific path elements to create the "hide sidebar" icon.

## References
- `IconBase` from './icon-base'
- `IconElement` and `IconProps` types from './icon-base'

### IconHideSidebar
#### Description
A React component that renders a "hide sidebar" icon using SVG paths within an `IconBase` component.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| props | Readonly&lt;IconProps&gt; | Props inherited from IconProps, including optional size |
| forwardedRef | React.Ref&lt;IconElement&gt; | Forwarded ref for the SVG element |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| - | JSX.Element | A React element representing the "hide sidebar" icon |

#### Internal Logic
1. The component uses `React.forwardRef` to create a new component that can accept a ref.
2. It renders an `IconBase` component, passing through all props and the forwarded ref.
3. Inside the `IconBase`, it defines two `path` elements that create the visual representation of the "hide sidebar" icon.
4. The paths use the `currentColor` fill, allowing the icon color to be controlled by the parent component.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| React | Core library for building the component |
| IconBase | Base component for creating SVG icons |

## Configuration
The component uses the following configuration:
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| size | number | 20 | The size of the icon (inherited from IconBase) |

## Side Effects
This component does not have any side effects. It's a pure functional component that renders based on its props.

## Performance Considerations
As a simple SVG icon component, performance impact should be minimal. However, for optimal performance in a larger application, consider using a global icon sprite or icon font if many icons are used frequently.
