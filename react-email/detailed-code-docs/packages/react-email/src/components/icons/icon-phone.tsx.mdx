## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `IconPhone` that renders an SVG icon of a phone. It's part of a larger icon system and uses a base icon component to handle common SVG properties and functionality.

## Code Structure
The `IconPhone` component is built on top of the `IconBase` component, which provides common SVG properties and functionality. The `IconPhone` component adds specific path elements to create the phone icon.

## References
- `IconBase` from './icon-base'
- `IconElement` and `IconProps` types from './icon-base'

### IconPhone
#### Description
A React component that renders an SVG icon of a phone. It uses the `IconBase` component and adds specific path elements to create the phone icon.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| props | IconProps | SVG properties passed to the IconBase component |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| - | React.ReactElement | An SVG element representing a phone icon |

#### Internal Logic
1. The component is defined using `React.forwardRef` to allow ref forwarding.
2. It spreads the received props to the `IconBase` component.
3. Two `path` elements are defined within the `IconBase` to create the phone icon:
   - The first path draws the phone's outline.
   - The second path draws a small line at the bottom of the phone (likely representing a button).

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| React | For creating the functional component |
| IconBase | Base component for all icons in the system |

## Performance Considerations
The use of `React.forwardRef` allows for efficient ref forwarding, which can be beneficial when the icon needs to be directly manipulated or measured in the parent component.

## Usage
This component is used in the `Topbar` component (from the related code snippet) as part of a toggle group for switching between desktop, mobile, and source code views. It represents the mobile view option in the user interface.
