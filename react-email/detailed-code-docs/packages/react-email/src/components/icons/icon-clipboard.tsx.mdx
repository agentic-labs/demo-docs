## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `IconClipboard` that renders an SVG icon representing a clipboard. It utilizes the `IconBase` component to provide a consistent base for all icons in the system.

## Code Structure
The `IconClipboard` component is built on top of the `IconBase` component, which provides common properties and structure for icons. The clipboard icon is defined using SVG path elements within the `IconBase`.

## References
- `IconBase` from './icon-base'
- `IconProps` and `IconElement` types from './icon-base'

### IconClipboard
#### Description
A React component that renders a clipboard icon using SVG paths. It forwards refs and accepts all props that `IconBase` accepts.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| props | IconProps | Props inherited from IconBase, including size and other SVG attributes |

#### Outputs
Returns a React element representing the clipboard icon.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses `React.forwardRef` to allow ref forwarding.
2. Renders an `IconBase` component with the provided props and ref.
3. Defines the clipboard icon using four SVG `path` elements within the `IconBase`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| React | For creating the functional component and using `forwardRef` |
| IconBase | Provides the base structure for the icon |
| IconProps, IconElement | Type definitions for the component props and ref |

## Performance Considerations
The use of `React.forwardRef` allows for efficient ref forwarding, which can be beneficial when integrating this icon component into larger component libraries or systems that rely on refs for DOM manipulation or measurements.
