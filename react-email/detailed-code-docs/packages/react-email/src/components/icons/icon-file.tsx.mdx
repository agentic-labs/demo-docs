## High-level description
This code defines an `IconFile` component, which is a React component representing a file icon. It utilizes the `IconBase` component to create an SVG icon with a specific path that forms the shape of a file.

## Code Structure
The `IconFile` component is built upon the `IconBase` component, inheriting its properties and functionality. It adds a specific SVG path to create the file icon shape.

## References
- `IconBase` from './icon-base'
- `IconProps` and `IconElement` types from './icon-base'

### IconFile
#### Description
`IconFile` is a React component that renders a file icon using SVG. It's created using the `React.forwardRef` to allow ref forwarding, enabling the parent component to directly access the underlying DOM element.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| props | Readonly&lt;IconProps&gt; | Props inherited from IconProps, including SVG attributes and a custom 'size' prop |
| forwardedRef | React.Ref&lt;IconElement&gt; | Forwarded ref for accessing the underlying SVG element |

#### Outputs
Returns a React element representing the file icon.

#### Internal Logic
1. The component spreads any additional props passed to it onto the `IconBase` component.
2. It defines an SVG path that creates the shape of a file icon.
3. The path uses `clipRule`, `fillRule`, `fill`, and `fillOpacity` attributes to define its appearance.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| React | For creating the functional component and using `forwardRef` |
| IconBase | Base component for creating the SVG icon |

## Performance Considerations
The use of `React.forwardRef` allows for efficient ref forwarding, which can be beneficial when direct DOM access is needed for the icon element.

## Notes
- The component sets its `displayName` to 'IconFile', which is useful for debugging purposes.
- The icon's appearance can be customized through the `currentColor` value and the `fillOpacity` attribute.
- The icon is designed to be flexible in size, inheriting the `size` prop from `IconProps`.
