## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `IconFolder` that renders an SVG icon of a folder. It utilizes the `IconBase` component to provide a consistent base for all icons in the application, while defining the specific path for the folder icon.

## Code Structure
The `IconFolder` component is built on top of the `IconBase` component, which provides common SVG attributes and sizing. The `IconFolder` component adds the specific path data for the folder icon.

## References
- `IconBase` from './icon-base'
- `IconProps` and `IconElement` types from './icon-base'

### IconFolder
#### Description
A React component that renders a folder icon as an SVG. It uses the `IconBase` component and adds a specific path for the folder shape.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| props | IconProps | Props inherited from IconBase, including optional `size` |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| - | React.ReactElement | An SVG element representing a folder icon |

#### Internal Logic
1. The component is defined using `React.forwardRef` to allow ref forwarding.
2. It spreads any additional props to the `IconBase` component.
3. Inside `IconBase`, it defines a `path` element with specific attributes for the folder shape.
4. The `clipRule`, `fillRule`, and `d` attributes of the path define the exact shape of the folder icon.
5. The icon uses `currentColor` for its fill, allowing for easy color customization through CSS.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| React | For creating the component |
| IconBase | Provides base SVG structure and common props |

## Notes
- The component uses the `displayName` property, which is useful for debugging purposes in React DevTools.
- The icon is designed to be customizable in size through the `size` prop inherited from `IconBase`.
- The use of `currentColor` for the fill allows the icon color to be easily changed using CSS.
