## High-level description
This code defines a reusable `IconButton` component in React, which is a customized button element designed to contain icon elements. It provides a consistent styling and behavior for icon-based buttons throughout the application.

### IconButton
#### Description
`IconButton` is a React component that renders a button element with specific styling for icon-based interactions. It uses the `forwardRef` API to allow ref forwarding to the underlying button element.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| children | React.ReactNode | The content to be rendered inside the button, typically an icon component |
| className | string | Additional CSS classes to be applied to the button |
| ...props | React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef&lt;'button'&gt; | Any other props that can be passed to a standard button element |

#### Outputs
The component renders a `&lt;button&gt;` element with the provided props and styling.

#### Internal Logic
1. The component uses the `cn` utility function (likely for class name merging) to combine default styles with any additional classes passed via the `className` prop.
2. It applies a set of default classes for styling, including rounded corners, text color, focus and hover effects, and transition properties.
3. The `ref` is forwarded to the underlying button element using `forwardedRef`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| React | Core library for building the component |
| cn | Utility function for merging class names (imported from '../../utils') |

## Side Effects
This component doesn't have any notable side effects. It's a pure presentational component that renders based on the props it receives.

## Performance Considerations
The use of `React.forwardRef` allows for efficient ref forwarding, which can be beneficial when integrating this component with other React features or libraries that require direct access to the DOM node.

## References
This component is used in the `CodeContainer` component (from the related code snippets) to render clipboard and download icons.

## Notes
1. The component uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling, as evidenced by the class names used in the `cn` function.
2. The `displayName` is set explicitly, which is useful for debugging and development tools.
3. The component is designed to be flexible, allowing additional props and classes to be passed through to the underlying button element.
