## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `Logo` that renders an SVG image. The SVG represents a stylized logo, likely for the React Email project, consisting of a geometric shape and text.

## Symbols

### Logo
#### Description
The `Logo` is a functional React component that returns an SVG element. The SVG contains various paths and shapes that make up the visual representation of the logo.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props.

#### Outputs
Returns a React element containing the SVG logo.

#### Internal Logic
The component uses an SVG with specific dimensions (119x32) and viewBox. It includes multiple `path` elements that define the shapes and text of the logo. The logo appears to have a geometric symbol on the left side and text on the right side, spelling out "React Email" or a similar phrase.

## Side Effects
This component has no side effects as it's a pure functional component that only renders an SVG.

## Dependencies
This component imports React, but doesn't use any external libraries or modules beyond that.

## References
The `Logo` component is exported and likely used in other parts of the application, such as the `Shell` component (as seen in the related code snippets).

Note: The logo design includes both graphical elements and text, making it a comprehensive branding element for the React Email project.
