## High-level description
This code defines a `CodeContainer` component in React, which renders a container for displaying code snippets in different languages. It provides functionality for switching between languages, copying code to clipboard, and downloading the code as a file.

## Code Structure
The `CodeContainer` component is the main export, which uses several utility functions and sub-components to render the code container, language tabs, and action buttons.

## Symbols

### CodeContainer
#### Description
A React functional component that renders a container for displaying code snippets with language tabs and action buttons.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| markups | MarkupProps[] | An array of objects containing language and content for each code snippet |
| activeLang | string | The currently active language |
| setActiveLang | (lang: string) =&gt; void | Function to set the active language |

#### Internal Logic
1. Renders language tabs using `LayoutGroup` and `motion` components from Framer Motion.
2. Implements copy to clipboard functionality.
3. Provides a download button for the current code snippet.
4. Renders the appropriate code snippet based on the active language.

### renderDownloadIcon
#### Description
A function that creates a download link for the current code snippet.

### renderClipboardIcon
#### Description
A function that renders a clipboard icon and handles the copy to clipboard functionality.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| framer-motion | Used for animations in language tabs |
| prism-react-renderer | Used for syntax highlighting in the Code component |
| react | Core React library |

## Error Handling
The component doesn't implement specific error handling mechanisms beyond basic React error boundaries.

## Performance Considerations
The component uses `React.useState` and `React.useEffect` hooks, which may impact performance if the component is rendered frequently or with large code snippets. The use of Framer Motion for animations could also affect performance on lower-end devices.

## API/Interface Reference
The `CodeContainer` component expects the following props:
| Prop | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| markups | MarkupProps[] | Array of code snippets with language information |
| activeLang | string | Currently active language |
| setActiveLang | (lang: string) =&gt; void | Function to set the active language |

Where `MarkupProps` is defined as:
```typescript
interface MarkupProps {
  language: Language;
  content: string;
}
```
