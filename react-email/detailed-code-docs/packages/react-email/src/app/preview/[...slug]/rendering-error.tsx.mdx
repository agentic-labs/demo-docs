## High-level description
The `RenderingError` component is a React component designed to display error information when there's an issue rendering an email preview. It presents a visually prominent error message with details such as the error name, message, and stack trace if available.

### `RenderingError`
#### Description
This is a React functional component that renders an error overlay with detailed information about the rendering error.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| props | { error: ErrorObject } | An object containing the error information to be displayed |

#### Outputs
The component returns JSX elements representing the error overlay.

#### Internal Logic
1. The component renders a semi-transparent black background overlay to dim the content behind it.
2. It then renders a white container with the error details, positioned in the center of the screen.
3. The error name and message are displayed prominently at the top of the container.
4. If a stack trace is available, it's rendered in a scrollable pre-formatted text area with a red background.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react | The component is built using React |
| ErrorObject | Type definition for the error object structure |

## References
- The `ErrorObject` type is imported from `'../../../utils/types/error-object'`.

## Side Effects
This component doesn't have any side effects. It's a pure presentational component that renders based on the provided props.

## Performance Considerations
The component uses absolute positioning and z-index to ensure the error overlay is displayed on top of other content. This approach is generally performant but could potentially interfere with other absolutely positioned elements on the page.

## Error Handling
This component is itself part of the error handling mechanism for the email rendering process. It doesn't implement additional error handling within itself.
