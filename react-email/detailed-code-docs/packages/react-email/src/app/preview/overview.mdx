## High-level description
This directory implements the email preview functionality for the React Email application. It uses Next.js dynamic routing to render previews for different email templates. The main components handle routing, rendering the email, and displaying the preview with options to view the source code and different device mockups.

## What does it do?
When a user accesses an email preview URL, this code dynamically determines the email to be displayed based on the URL slug. It retrieves the email content, renders it within a preview interface, and allows users to interact with the email in different view modes (desktop, mobile) and view the source code. The preview also includes hot reloading during development to reflect changes in the email template immediately.

## Entry points
The main entry point is `page.tsx`, which acts as the Next.js page component. It handles routing, retrieves email data, and renders the `Preview` component. The `preview.tsx` file defines the `Preview` component responsible for rendering the email preview interface.

## Key Files

### preview/[...slug]/preview.tsx
This file contains the `Preview` component, which is the core of the email preview functionality. It manages the different view modes (desktop, mobile, source code), handles hot reloading, and renders the email content within a user-friendly interface.

### preview/[...slug]/rendering-error.tsx
This file defines the `RenderingError` component, which is responsible for displaying errors encountered during the email rendering process. It provides a visually distinct error message with details about the error, aiding developers in debugging. 

## Dependencies
- **Next.js**: Used for routing, server-side rendering, and navigation.
- **React**: The core library for building the user interface.
- **Sonner**: A library for displaying toast notifications, likely used for providing feedback during hot reloading.
