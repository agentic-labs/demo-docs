## Symbols

### `inter`
#### Description

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |

#### Internal Logic
1. Imports the Inter font from Next.js's Google Fonts integration.
2. Configures the font with the following options:
   - `subsets`: Set to `['latin']` to include only Latin characters.
   - `variable`: Set to `'--font-inter'`, which can be used as a CSS variable.
   - `display`: Set to `'swap'`, which tells the browser to use a fallback font until the Inter font is loaded.

## Dependencies

| next/font/google | Provides optimized loading of Google Fonts in Next.js applications |

## References
The `inter` constant is used in other parts of the application, as seen in the related code snippets:

1. In `packages/react-email/src/components/tooltip-content.tsx`, it's used to apply the Inter font to tooltip content:
   ```typescript
   className={cn(
     'bg-black text-white border border-slate-6 z-20 px-3 py-2 rounded-md text-xs',
     `${inter.variable} font-sans`,
   )}
   ```

2. In `packages/react-email/src/components/send.tsx`, it's used to apply the Inter font to a popover content:
   ```typescript
   className={`w-80 -mt-10 p-3 bg-black/70 backdrop-blur-lg border border-slate-6 text-slate-11 rounded-lg shadow-md font-sans ${inter.variable}`}
   ```

These usages demonstrate that the `inter` constant is utilized to consistently apply the Inter font across different components in the application.
