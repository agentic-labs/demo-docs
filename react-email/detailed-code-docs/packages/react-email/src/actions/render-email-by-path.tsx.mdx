## High-level description
This code defines a server-side function `renderEmailByPath` that renders an email template from a given file path. It handles the rendering process, error handling, and provides performance metrics for the rendering operation.

## Code Structure
The main function `renderEmailByPath` uses several utility functions and modules to perform its task. It interacts with the file system, uses the `getEmailComponent` utility, and employs various logging and error handling mechanisms.

## References
- `getEmailComponent` from '../utils/get-email-component'
- `improveErrorWithSourceMap` from '../utils/improve-error-with-sourcemap'
- `closeOraOnSIGNIT` from '../utils/close-ora-on-sigint'

## Symbols

### `renderEmailByPath`
#### Description
An asynchronous function that renders an email template from a given file path.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| emailPath | string | The file path of the email template to render |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| EmailRenderingResult | RenderedEmailMetadata \| { error: ErrorObject } | The rendered email data or an error object |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes performance timing and spinner for progress indication.
2. Retrieves the email component using `getEmailComponent`.
3. If successful, renders the email component using the provided `render` function.
4. Reads the original React markup from the file.
5. Logs the rendering time with color-coded performance indicators.
6. Returns the rendered markup, plain text, and original React markup.
7. If an error occurs, it's enhanced with source map information and returned.

## Side Effects
- File system operations (reading files)
- Console output (via spinner and logging)

#### Performance Considerations
The function measures and logs the rendering time, providing visual feedback on performance (green for fast, yellow for moderate, red for slow).

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| fs | File system operations |
| path | File path manipulations |
| ora | Terminal spinner for progress indication |
| log-symbols | Logging symbols for success/error |
| chalk | Terminal string styling |

## Error Handling
Errors during rendering are caught, enhanced with source map information using `improveErrorWithSourceMap`, and returned as part of the `EmailRenderingResult`.

## Logging
The function uses `ora` for progress indication and `log-symbols` for success/error logging. It also logs the rendering time with color-coded performance indicators.
