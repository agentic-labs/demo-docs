## High-level description
This code defines a `dev` function that sets up a development server for React Email. It starts a server, enables hot reloading, and handles errors during the process.

## Code Structure
The `dev` function is the main entry point, which calls `startDevServer` and `setupHotreloading` from imported utility functions.

## Symbols

### `dev`
#### Description
An asynchronous function that initializes and runs the development server for React Email.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| dir | string | The relative path to the emails directory |
| port | string | The port number for the server to run on |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the specified emails directory exists.
2. Starts the development server using `startDevServer`.
3. Sets up hot reloading using `setupHotreloading`.
4. Catches and logs any errors, exiting the process if an error occurs.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| node:fs | File system operations |
| ../utils | Custom utilities for starting the dev server and setting up hot reloading |

## Error Handling
The function uses a try-catch block to handle errors. If an error occurs, it's logged to the console, and the process exits with a status code of 1.

## References
- `startDevServer`: Imported from `../utils`, used to initialize the development server.
- `setupHotreloading`: Imported from `../utils`, used to set up hot reloading for the server.

## Performance Considerations
The function uses `parseInt` to convert the port string to a number, which is more efficient than using the unary plus operator or Number() for integer conversion.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code.
