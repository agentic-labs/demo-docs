## High-level description
The `/packages/react-email/src/cli/commands` directory houses the core command-line interface (CLI) commands for the React Email library. These commands provide functionalities for building, developing, and exporting React Email templates.

## What does it do?
This directory acts as the heart of the React Email CLI, allowing users to interact with the library through their terminal. It enables developers to:

- **Build:** Create a preview application to visualize and test email templates.
- **Develop:** Run a local development server with hot reloading for real-time feedback while designing emails.
- **Export:** Generate static HTML files from React Email components for deployment.
- **Start:** Launch the preview server for a built React Email project.

Each command is implemented as a separate module within the directory, providing a clean separation of concerns and facilitating maintainability.

## Entry points
The primary entry points for developers are the individual command files:

- `build.ts`: Handles the build process for the React Email preview application.
- `dev.ts`:  Manages the development server and hot reloading functionality.
- `export.ts`: Orchestrates the export of React Email templates to static HTML files.
- `start.ts`: Launches the preview server for a previously built React Email project.

These files define the core logic for each command, utilizing utility functions and external libraries as needed.

## Key Files
- **`testing/export.test.ts`**: This file contains unit tests for the `exportTemplates` function, ensuring its functionality and correctness. It specifically focuses on testing the export process for the "vercel-invite-user" template.

## Dependencies
The CLI commands rely on several external libraries and built-in Node.js modules:

- **`fs`**: Provides file system operations for reading, writing, and manipulating files and directories.
- **`path`**: Enables manipulation and resolution of file and directory paths.
- **`ora`**: Offers a terminal spinner for providing visual feedback during long-running processes.
- **`child_process`**: Allows spawning child processes for executing external commands, such as `npm` or `npx`.
- **`esbuild`**: Used for bundling JavaScript code, particularly in the `exportTemplates` function.
- **`@react-email/render`**:  The core library for rendering React Email components into HTML.
- **`glob`**: Used for flexible file pattern matching, often for finding email template files.
- **`log-symbols`**: Provides colored symbols for enhancing console output and logging.
- **`Jest`**: The testing framework used for unit testing the CLI commands.

These dependencies are crucial for the CLI's functionality, enabling it to interact with the file system, manage processes, bundle code, render email templates, and provide user feedback.
