## High-level description
This code is a unit test for the `tree` function, which generates a tree-like representation of a directory structure. The test verifies that the `tree` function produces the expected output for a specific directory structure with a depth of 2.

## References
The test file references the `tree` function from the './tree' module.

## Symbols

### `test('tree(__dirname, 2)', async () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
This is a Jest test case that checks the output of the `tree` function when called with `__dirname` and a depth of 2.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `__dirname` | string | The directory path of the current module |
| 2 | number | The depth of the directory tree to generate |

#### Outputs
The test doesn't have explicit outputs, but it compares the result of `tree(__dirname, 2)` with an expected snapshot.

#### Internal Logic
1. The test calls the `tree` function with `__dirname` and a depth of 2.
2. It uses Jest's `toMatchInlineSnapshot` matcher to compare the result with an inline snapshot.
3. The snapshot represents the expected directory structure output.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Jest | Testing framework used for running the test and providing assertion methods |

## Error Handling
This test doesn't implement specific error handling. It relies on Jest's built-in error reporting for test failures.

## Performance Considerations
The test uses an async function, which is appropriate for testing asynchronous operations like file system access in the `tree` function.

## TODOs
There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.

This test case serves as a regression test for the `tree` function, ensuring that it correctly generates a tree-like representation of the directory structure. The use of an inline snapshot makes it easy to update the expected output if the directory structure changes intentionally.
