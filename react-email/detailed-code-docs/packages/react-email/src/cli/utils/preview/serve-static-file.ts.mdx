## High-level description
This code defines a function `serveStaticFile` that serves static files in an HTTP server environment. It reads a file from a specified path and sends its content as the response, setting the appropriate content type based on the file extension.

## Symbols

### `serveStaticFile`
#### Description
This asynchronous function handles serving static files for an HTTP server. It constructs the file path, reads the file, and sends its content as the response with the appropriate content type.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| res | http.ServerResponse | The HTTP response object to write the file content to |
| parsedUrl | url.UrlWithParsedQuery | The parsed URL object containing the pathname |
| staticDirRelativePath | string | The relative path to the static directory |

#### Internal Logic
1. Constructs the absolute path to the static file by joining the current working directory, static directory relative path, and the pathname from the parsed URL.
2. Opens the file for reading.
3. Reads the file content.
4. Sets the Content-type header based on the file extension.
5. Sends the file content as the response.
6. Handles errors by logging them and sending a 500 status code with an error message.
7. Ensures the file handle is closed in a finally block.

#### Error Handling
The function includes error handling for file reading failures. If an error occurs, it logs the error to the console and sends a 500 status code with a generic error message to the client.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| node:http | For HTTP server response types |
| node:path | For file path operations |
| node:fs | For file system operations |
| node:url | For URL parsing types |
| mime-types | For determining MIME types based on file extensions |

## Performance Considerations
The function uses asynchronous file operations (`fs.promises`) to avoid blocking the event loop while reading files. This allows the server to handle multiple requests concurrently.

## References
This function is likely used in a larger HTTP server context, possibly in conjunction with the `startDevServer` function from the related `start-dev-server.ts` file.
