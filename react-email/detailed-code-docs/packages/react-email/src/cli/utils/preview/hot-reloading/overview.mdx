## High-level description
This directory contains the code responsible for implementing hot reloading functionality in the React Email development server. Hot reloading allows developers to see the effects of their code changes in real-time without manually refreshing the browser. This is achieved by watching for file changes, analyzing dependencies, and notifying the browser to reload only the necessary components.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory sets up a system that monitors the file system for changes in the React Email project. When a file is saved, the system analyzes the changes and identifies other files that depend on the modified code. It then sends a notification to the browser, instructing it to reload only the affected parts of the application. This process significantly speeds up development by eliminating the need for full page reloads after every code change.

## Entry points
The main entry point for the hot reloading functionality is `setup-hot-reloading.ts`. This file is responsible for initializing the WebSocket server, setting up the file watcher, and creating the dependency graph.

- `setup-hot-reloading.ts`: This file sets up the hot reloading functionality. It creates a WebSocket server to communicate with the browser, starts a file watcher to monitor for changes in the project files, and initializes a dependency graph to track relationships between different modules.

## Key Files

### create-dependency-graph.ts
This file contains the logic for creating and managing the dependency graph. The dependency graph is a data structure that represents the relationships between different modules in the project. It is used to determine which files need to be reloaded when a change is detected.

### get-imported-modules.ts
This file provides a function to extract the list of imported modules from a JavaScript or TypeScript file. This information is used to build the dependency graph.

## Dependencies

- `http`: Used for creating and managing the HTTP server.
- `path`: Provides utilities for working with file and directory paths.
- `socket.io`: Enables real-time, bidirectional communication between the server and the browser using WebSockets.
- `chokidar`: A library for watching file system changes.
- `debounce`: A utility function for limiting the rate at which a function can be executed.
- `@babel/core`: The core Babel compiler package.
- `@babel/parser`: Used by Babel to parse JavaScript code into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
- `node:fs`: Provides access to the file system.

## Configuration
The hot reloading functionality does not rely on any specific configuration files or environment variables. The behavior of the system is determined by the code itself and the structure of the React Email project.
