---

## High-level description
This code sets up hot reloading functionality for a development server in a React Email project. It watches for file changes in the specified email directory, updates a dependency graph, and notifies connected clients to reload when changes occur.

## Code Structure
The main function `setupHotreloading` sets up a WebSocket server, file watcher, and dependency graph. It uses helper functions from the `createDependencyGraph` module to manage dependencies and handle file changes.

## References
- `createDependencyGraph` from './create-dependency-graph'
- `HotReloadChange` type from '../../../../utils/types/hot-reload-change'

### `setupHotreloading`
#### Description
Sets up hot reloading for a development server by creating a WebSocket server, watching for file changes, and managing a dependency graph.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| devServer | http.Server | The development server instance |
| emailDirRelativePath | string | Relative path to the email directory |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| watcher | FSWatcher | The file system watcher instance |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up a WebSocket server and manages client connections.
2. Creates a dependency graph for the email directory.
3. Sets up a file watcher for the email directory and files outside it.
4. Handles file change events, updates the dependency graph, and notifies clients.
5. Implements debounced reloading to avoid excessive updates.

## Side Effects
- Modifies the global process object by adding event listeners.
- Creates and manages WebSocket connections.
- Watches the file system for changes.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| http | For working with the HTTP server |
| path | For handling file paths |
| socket.io | For WebSocket communication |
| chokidar | For file system watching |
| debounce | For debouncing reload events |

## Error Handling
The code includes basic error handling for file system operations and implements a graceful shutdown process for the file watcher.

## Performance Considerations
- Uses debouncing to limit the frequency of reload events.
- Efficiently updates the dependency graph by only processing changed files.
- Manages files outside the email directory to avoid unnecessary watching.

### `createDependencyGraph`
#### Description
Creates and manages a dependency graph for the email files in the specified directory.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
| directory | string | The absolute path to the email directory |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
| [graph, updateDependencyGraph, { resolveDependentsOf }] | [DependencyGraph, Function, { resolveDependentsOf: Function }] | The dependency graph, update function, and utility function |

#### Internal Logic
1. Reads all files in the specified directory.
2. Creates an initial dependency graph structure.
3. Provides functions to update the graph and resolve dependents.

___

This code implements a robust hot reloading system for a React Email development environment. It efficiently manages file dependencies and updates, ensuring that changes are promptly reflected in the preview while minimizing unnecessary reloads.
