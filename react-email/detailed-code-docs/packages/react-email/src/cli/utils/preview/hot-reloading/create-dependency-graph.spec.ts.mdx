## High-level description
This file contains a test suite for the `createDependencyGraph` function, which is responsible for creating and updating a dependency graph of TypeScript/JavaScript files in a project. The test verifies the initial creation of the graph and its behavior when files are added, changed, or removed.

## Code Structure
The test file imports necessary modules and defines a single test case that covers multiple scenarios for the `createDependencyGraph` function. It uses helper functions to convert relative paths to absolute paths and to create a standardized representation of the dependency graph for comparison.

## Symbols

### `test('createDependencyGraph()')`
#### Description
This is the main test function that verifies the behavior of the `createDependencyGraph` function.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up the test environment by removing any existing test file.
2. Calls `createDependencyGraph` to create an initial dependency graph.
3. Defines helper functions for path conversion and graph standardization.
4. Checks the initial state of the dependency graph.
5. Tests adding a new file to the graph.
6. Tests changing the contents of the added file.
7. Tests removing the added file from the graph.

#### Performance Considerations
The test involves file system operations, which can be slow. It uses `async/await` to handle these operations efficiently.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| path | For handling file paths |
| fs | For file system operations |
| createDependencyGraph | The main function being tested |

## Error Handling
The test doesn't explicitly handle errors but uses Jest's assertion methods to verify expected outcomes.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code.

## Additional Notes
1. The test creates a temporary file `.for-dependency-graph.ts` for testing purposes and removes it at the end.
2. The test uses a predefined `initialDependencyGraph` object to compare against the created graph.
3. The test covers three main scenarios: adding a file, changing a file, and removing a file from the dependency graph.
4. The test uses `toEqual` assertions to compare complex objects and `toContain`/`not.toContain` for checking array contents.
5. The test demonstrates how the dependency graph updates when files are added, modified, or removed, including how it affects the `dependentPaths` of other files in the graph.

This test file is crucial for ensuring the correct functionality of the `createDependencyGraph` function, which is likely an important part of the project's build or development process, possibly related to hot reloading or dependency tracking.
