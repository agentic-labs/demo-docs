## High-level description
This code implements a utility function `tree` that generates a tree-like representation of a directory structure. It recursively traverses directories up to a specified depth, creating a formatted string output that visually represents the hierarchy of files and folders.

## Code Structure
The main function `tree` relies on an internal recursive function `getTreeLines` to build the tree structure. The `SYMBOLS` object defines the characters used for formatting the tree output.

## Symbols

### `getTreeLines`
#### Description
This internal async function recursively traverses a directory structure and generates an array of formatted lines representing the tree.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| dirPath | string | The path to the directory to be traversed |
| depth | number | The maximum depth to traverse |
| currentDepth | number | The current depth in the recursion (default: 0) |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| lines | string[] | An array of formatted strings representing the tree structure |

#### Internal Logic
1. Resolve the full path of the directory and get its base name.
2. If the current depth is less than the maximum depth and the path is a directory:
   - Read the directory contents.
   - Sort the contents (directories first, then alphabetically).
   - Iterate through the contents:
     - For files, add a formatted line to the output.
     - For directories, recursively call `getTreeLines` and format the results.
3. Return the array of formatted lines.

### `tree`
#### Description
This is the main exported async function that generates a tree-like representation of a directory structure.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| dirPath | string | The path to the directory to be represented as a tree |
| depth | number | The maximum depth to traverse in the directory structure |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| treeString | string | A formatted string representing the directory tree |

#### Internal Logic
1. Call `getTreeLines` with the provided `dirPath` and `depth`.
2. Join the resulting array of lines using the operating system's end-of-line character.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| node:fs | File system operations (promises API) |
| node:os | Operating system-related utilities |
| node:path | File path operations |

## Performance Considerations
The function uses asynchronous file system operations, which can be beneficial for performance when dealing with large directory structures. However, for very deep or broad directory trees, the recursive nature of the algorithm might lead to high memory usage or stack overflow issues.
