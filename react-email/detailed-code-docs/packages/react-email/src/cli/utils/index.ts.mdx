## High-level description
This file serves as an index module for the utility functions used in the React Email CLI. It exports all the utilities from the 'tree' and 'preview' modules, making them easily accessible to other parts of the application.

## Code Structure
The code is structured as a simple index file that re-exports functionality from two other modules: 'tree' and 'preview'.

## Symbols

### `export * from './tree'`
#### Description
This statement exports all the named exports from the './tree' module. Based on the related code snippet, this likely includes the `tree` function, which generates a tree-like representation of a directory structure.

### `export * from './preview'`
#### Description
This statement exports all the named exports from the './preview' module. From the related code snippet, this includes exports from 'hot-reloading/setup-hot-reloading' and 'start-dev-server', which are likely utilities for setting up hot reloading and starting a development server for previewing emails.

## Dependencies
The file itself doesn't directly import any external libraries, but it relies on the following internal modules:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| './tree' | Provides utilities for generating directory tree structures |
| './preview' | Provides utilities for email preview and development server |

## References
This index file is likely referenced by other parts of the React Email CLI that need to use the tree or preview utilities. The exact usage would depend on how these utilities are implemented in their respective modules.

Note: The actual functionality of the exported utilities is not defined in this file but in the modules it re-exports from. For a complete understanding of the available utilities, one would need to examine the contents of the './tree' and './preview' modules.
