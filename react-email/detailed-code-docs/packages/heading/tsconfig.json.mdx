title: "tsconfig.json"
---

## High-level description

This file is a TypeScript configuration file (`tsconfig.json`) for the "heading" package. It sets up the TypeScript compiler options for a React library project, extending a base configuration and specifying which files to include and exclude from compilation.

## Symbols

### `extends`
#### Description
This property specifies the base configuration file that this `tsconfig.json` extends. In this case, it extends the "react-library.json" configuration from the "tsconfig" package.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| extends | string | Path to the base configuration file |

### `include`
#### Description
This property specifies which files or directories should be included in the TypeScript compilation process. In this configuration, it includes all files in the current directory (represented by ".").

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| include | array of strings | Glob patterns for files to include |

### `exclude`
#### Description
This property specifies which files or directories should be excluded from the TypeScript compilation process. In this configuration, it excludes the "dist", "build", and "node_modules" directories.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| exclude | array of strings | Glob patterns for files to exclude |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| tsconfig/react-library.json | Base TypeScript configuration for React libraries |

This configuration file relies on a base configuration file (`react-library.json`) from the "tsconfig" package, which likely contains pre-defined settings optimized for React library development.

## Notes
1. This configuration is specifically tailored for a React library project, as indicated by the extended configuration file name.
2. The configuration includes all files in the current directory but explicitly excludes common output directories (`dist` and `build`) and the `node_modules` directory to prevent unnecessary compilation of external dependencies.
3. The actual compiler options are not directly visible in this file, as they are inherited from the extended configuration. To see the full set of options, one would need to examine the `react-library.json` file from the "tsconfig" package.
