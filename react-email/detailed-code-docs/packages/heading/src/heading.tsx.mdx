## High-level description
This code defines a reusable `Heading` component in React, which renders an HTML heading element with customizable properties such as tag type and margin. It utilizes TypeScript for type safety and React's forwardRef for ref forwarding.

## Code Structure
The main symbol is the `Heading` component, which uses types and utilities imported from other files. The `withMargin` utility is used to apply margin styles to the heading element.

## References
- `As` type from "./utils/as"
- `Margin` type and `withMargin` function from "./utils/spaces"

## Symbols

### `Heading`
#### Description
A React component that renders an HTML heading element with customizable properties.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| as | HeadingAs | The HTML tag to use for the heading (default: 'h1') |
| children | React.ReactNode | The content of the heading |
| style | React.CSSProperties | Additional styles to apply |
| m, mx, my, mt, mr, mb, ml | number \| string | Margin properties |
| ...props | React.ComponentPropsWithRef&lt;HeadingAs&gt; | Additional props to pass to the heading element |

#### Outputs
Returns a React element representing the heading.

#### Internal Logic
1. Destructures the props, setting a default tag of 'h1'.
2. Uses the `withMargin` utility to generate margin styles.
3. Renders the specified tag with combined styles and forwarded props.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| React | Core library for building the component |

## Performance Considerations
The component uses `React.forwardRef` to properly handle ref forwarding, which is important for accessibility and DOM manipulation.
