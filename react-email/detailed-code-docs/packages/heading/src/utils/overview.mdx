## High-level description
The `packages/heading/src/utils` directory contains utility functions and types for the Heading component. This includes a polymorphic type for defining the rendered HTML element, functions for handling margin and spacing props, and unit tests for these utilities.

## What does it do?
This directory provides helper code to enhance the functionality and flexibility of the Heading component. It allows the component to render different heading levels (e.g., `h1`, `h2`, etc.), apply margins and spacing consistently, and ensures type safety for these operations.

## Key Files

### `as.ts`
Defines the `As` type, a TypeScript utility for creating polymorphic React components. This allows the Heading component to render as different HTML heading elements while maintaining type safety for props and refs.

### `spaces.ts`
Provides utility functions (`withMargin`, `withSpace`) and types (`Margin`, `MarginCSSProperty`) for handling margin properties in a flexible and consistent way. These utilities convert shorthand margin props into valid CSS styles, simplifying the application of margins to the Heading component.

### `utils.spec.ts`
Contains unit tests written with Jest to verify the functionality of the `withMargin` and `withSpace` utilities. These tests ensure that the functions correctly handle various margin scenarios and produce the expected CSS properties, contributing to the reliability and maintainability of the codebase.
