## High-level description
This code defines a utility type `As` in TypeScript, which is used for creating polymorphic components in React. It allows components to change their rendered element type while maintaining proper type checking for props and ref.

## Symbols

### `As&lt;DefaultTag, T1, T2, T3, T4, T5&gt;`

#### Description
`As` is a generic type that creates a union of object types. Each object type in the union represents a possible configuration for a component, allowing it to render as different HTML elements or React components while maintaining proper typing for props and ref.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| DefaultTag | React.ElementType | The default element type for the component |
| T1 | React.ElementType | First alternative element type |
| T2 | React.ElementType | Second alternative element type (defaults to T1) |
| T3 | React.ElementType | Third alternative element type (defaults to T1) |
| T4 | React.ElementType | Fourth alternative element type (defaults to T1) |
| T5 | React.ElementType | Fifth alternative element type (defaults to T1) |

#### Internal Logic
1. The type creates a union of six object types.
2. Each object type extends `React.ComponentPropsWithRef&lt;T&gt;`, where T is the corresponding element type (DefaultTag, T1, T2, T3, T4, or T5).
3. Each object type, except for the default one, includes an `as` property of the corresponding element type.
4. The default object type has an optional `as` property of type `DefaultTag`.

## References
The `As` type is used in the related file `packages/heading/src/heading.tsx`:
- It's imported and used to create the `HeadingAs` type: `export type HeadingAs = As&lt;"h1", "h2", "h3", "h4", "h5", "h6"&gt;;`
- `HeadingAs` is then used as part of the `HeadingProps` type.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| React | The `As` type uses React types like `React.ElementType` and `React.ComponentPropsWithRef` |

This utility type is crucial for creating flexible, polymorphic components in React with TypeScript. It allows components to change their rendered element type (e.g., from an `h1` to an `h2`) while maintaining proper type checking for props and ref. This is particularly useful for creating reusable UI components that need to adapt to different contexts or styling requirements.
