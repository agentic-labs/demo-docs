## High-level description
This code contains unit tests for the `withMargin` and `withSpace` utility functions, which are used to apply margin styles to React components. The tests ensure that these functions correctly handle various margin scenarios and produce the expected CSS properties.

## References
The code references the `withMargin` and `withSpace` functions from the "./spaces" module, as well as the `Margin` type.

## Symbols

### `describe("withMargin", ...)`
#### Description
This test suite verifies the functionality of the `withMargin` function, which converts margin properties into CSS styles.

#### Internal Logic
The suite includes multiple test cases that cover different scenarios:
1. Empty input
2. Single margin property (top)
3. Horizontal margins (left and right)
4. Vertical margins (top and bottom)
5. All-side margin
6. Multiple specific sides
7. Invalid margin values

Each test case arranges input, acts by calling `withMargin`, and asserts the expected output using Jest's `expect` function.

### `describe("withSpace", ...)`
#### Description
This test suite verifies the functionality of the `withSpace` function, which applies space values to specified CSS properties.

#### Internal Logic
The suite includes two test cases:
1. Undefined value input
2. Applying space to multiple properties

Each test case arranges input, acts by calling `withSpace`, and asserts the expected output using Jest's `expect` function.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Jest | Testing framework (implied by the use of `describe`, `it`, and `expect`) |

## Error Handling
The tests implicitly verify error handling by checking the output of the functions with various inputs, including invalid ones. For example, the last test in the `withMargin` suite checks that invalid margin values are ignored.

## Performance Considerations
These tests are designed to be fast and lightweight, as they only involve simple function calls and object comparisons. The performance impact should be minimal, making them suitable for frequent execution during development.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in this code.
