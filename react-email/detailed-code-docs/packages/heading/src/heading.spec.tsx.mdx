## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for the `Heading` component from a React Email library. The tests verify the correct rendering of the component, including its content, style properties, and other attributes.

## Symbols

### `describe("render", () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
This is the main test suite for the `Heading` component, focusing on its rendering behavior.

#### Internal Logic
The suite contains three test cases, each testing different aspects of the `Heading` component's rendering.

### `it("renders children correctly", async () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
This test verifies that the `Heading` component correctly renders its child content.

#### Internal Logic
1. Arrange: Define a test message.
2. Act: Render the `Heading` component with the test message as its child.
3. Assert: Check if the rendered HTML contains the test message.

### `it("passes style and other props correctly", async () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
This test ensures that the `Heading` component correctly applies style properties and other attributes.

#### Internal Logic
1. Arrange: Define a style object and a data-testid attribute.
2. Act: Render the `Heading` component with the defined style and data-testid.
3. Assert: Check if the rendered HTML contains the correct style (background-color) and data-testid attribute.

### `it("renders the &lt;Heading&gt; component", async () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
This test verifies the complete rendering of the `Heading` component with specific props.

#### Internal Logic
1. Arrange: Prepare a `Heading` component with `as="h2"` and `mx={4}` props.
2. Act: Render the component with "Lorem ipsum" as its content.
3. Assert: Compare the rendered output with an inline snapshot to ensure correct HTML structure and styling.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @react-email/render | Provides the `render` function for rendering React components to HTML |
| ./index | Imports the `Heading` component being tested |

## Error Handling
The tests use Jest's `expect` function for assertions. If any of the expectations fail, the test will throw an error.

## API/Interface Reference
The tests demonstrate the following props and usage of the `Heading` component:

| Prop | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| children | React.ReactNode | The content to be rendered inside the heading |
| style | object | Custom styles to be applied to the heading |
| as | string | Specifies the heading level (e.g., "h2") |
| mx | number | Sets horizontal margin |

Note: Additional props (like `data-testid`) can also be passed and will be rendered on the heading element.
