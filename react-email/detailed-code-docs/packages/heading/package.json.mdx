## High-level description
This `package.json` file defines the configuration for the `@react-email/heading` package, which is a React component for rendering heading text in email templates. It specifies the package's metadata, build scripts, dependencies, and distribution settings.

## Code Structure
This is a JSON configuration file, so there isn't a traditional code structure. However, it defines various properties that configure the package and its build process.

## Symbols

### Package Information
#### Description
Defines basic information about the package.

| Name | Value | Description |
|:-----|:------|:------------|
| name | "@react-email/heading" | The package name |
| version | "0.0.14" | The current version of the package |
| description | "A block of heading text" | Brief description of the package's purpose |
| license | "MIT" | The license under which the package is distributed |

### Main Fields
#### Description
Specifies the entry points for different module systems.

| Name | Value | Description |
|:-----|:------|:------------|
| main | "./dist/index.js" | The main entry point for CommonJS |
| module | "./dist/index.mjs" | The entry point for ES modules |
| types | "./dist/index.d.ts" | The TypeScript type definitions |

### Exports
#### Description
Defines the package's export map for more granular control over module resolution.

```json
"exports": {
  ".": {
    "import": {
      "types": "./dist/index.d.mts",
      "default": "./dist/index.mjs"
    },
    "require": {
      "types": "./dist/index.d.ts",
      "default": "./dist/index.js"
    }
  }
}
```

This configuration allows for different resolutions based on whether the package is being imported as an ES module or required as a CommonJS module.

### Scripts
#### Description
Defines npm scripts for various development tasks.

| Script | Command | Description |
|:-------|:--------|:------------|
| build | "tsup src/index.ts --format esm,cjs --dts --external react" | Builds the package in ESM and CJS formats with TypeScript declarations |
| clean | "rm -rf dist" | Removes the dist directory |
| dev | "tsup src/index.ts --format esm,cjs --dts --external react --watch" | Runs the build in watch mode for development |
| lint | "eslint ." | Runs ESLint on the project |
| test:watch | "vitest" | Runs tests in watch mode |
| test | "vitest run" | Runs tests once |

### Repository
#### Description
Specifies the git repository information.

```json
"repository": {
  "type": "git",
  "url": "https://github.com/resend/react-email.git",

```json
"publishConfig": {
  "access": "public"
