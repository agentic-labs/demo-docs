## High-level description
This code configures ESLint for a React-based internal package named "heading". It extends a custom ESLint configuration specifically designed for internal React libraries.

## Code Structure
The file exports a single configuration object that extends the "custom/react-internal" ESLint configuration.

## Symbols

### module.exports
#### Description
This is the main export of the ESLint configuration file. It defines the ESLint rules and settings for the "heading" package.

#### Inputs
N/A

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| extends | Array | An array containing the ESLint configuration to extend |

#### Internal Logic
The configuration extends a single custom ESLint configuration named "custom/react-internal". This likely refers to a shared configuration file designed for internal React libraries.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| custom/react-internal | Provides the base ESLint configuration for internal React libraries |

## References
This configuration file references the "custom/react-internal" ESLint configuration, which is defined in the related file "packages/eslint-config-custom/react-internal.js".

## Additional Context
Based on the related "react-internal.js" file, we can infer that the "custom/react-internal" configuration:

1. Extends multiple configurations from the Vercel Engineering Style Guide.
2. Is designed for internal (bundled by their consumer) libraries that use React.
3. Includes specific rules for TypeScript and React.
4. Sets up the environment for both browser and Node.js.
5. Configures import resolution for TypeScript projects.
6. Ignores certain directories and files.
7. Overrides some default rules to customize the linting behavior.

This setup ensures that the "heading" package follows a consistent coding style and best practices aligned with the Vercel Engineering Style Guide, while also accommodating the specific needs of an internal React library.
