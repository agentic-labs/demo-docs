## High-level description
The `packages/heading` directory contains the implementation of a reusable `Heading` component for the React Email library. This component is designed to render HTML heading elements with customizable properties, including the heading level, margin settings, and additional styles. The package is set up as a TypeScript project with ESLint configuration, unit tests, and proper build and publishing settings.

## What does it do?
The `Heading` component allows developers to easily create heading elements in their email templates with the following capabilities:

1. Render different heading levels (h1, h2, h3, etc.) using the `as` prop.
2. Apply custom margins using shorthand props (m, mx, my, mt, mr, mb, ml).
3. Add custom styles and additional attributes to the heading element.
4. Forward refs for accessibility and DOM manipulation.

The component is designed to be flexible and type-safe, leveraging TypeScript for improved developer experience and code reliability. It is part of the larger React Email ecosystem, which aims to simplify the creation of email templates using React components.

## Key Files

1. `src/heading.tsx`: Contains the main implementation of the `Heading` component.
2. `src/heading.spec.tsx`: Includes unit tests for the `Heading` component.
3. `src/utils/`: Contains utility functions and types for margin handling and polymorphic components.
4. `package.json`: Defines the package metadata, scripts, and dependencies.
5. `tsconfig.json`: Configures TypeScript compilation settings.
6. `.eslintrc.js`: Sets up ESLint rules for code linting.

## Dependencies
The package has the following key dependencies:

1. React (peer dependency): ^18.0 || ^19.0 || ^19.0.0-rc
2. Development dependencies:
   - @react-email/render: For rendering components in tests
   - eslint-config-custom: Custom ESLint configuration
   - tsconfig: Shared TypeScript configuration
   - typescript: For TypeScript support

## Configuration
The `Heading` component can be customized through props:

```tsx
&lt;Heading
  as="h2"
  mx={4}
  style={{ backgroundColor: 'red' }}
  data-testid="custom-heading"
&gt;
  Custom Heading
&lt;/Heading&gt;
```

Key configurable props include:

| Prop | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| as | 'h1' \| 'h2' \| 'h3' \| 'h4' \| 'h5' \| 'h6' | Specifies the heading level (default: 'h1') |
| m, mx, my, mt, mr, mb, ml | number \| string | Margin properties |
| style | React.CSSProperties | Additional styles to apply |
| children | React.ReactNode | The content of the heading |

The package is configured to:
- Use TypeScript for type checking and compilation
- Use ESLint for code linting
- Build both ESM and CJS formats
- Generate TypeScript declaration files
- Support Node.js version 18 and above

The package is part of a monorepo structure within the react-email project, as indicated by the repository configuration in `package.json`.
