title: "head.spec.tsx"

## High-level description
This code defines unit tests for the `&lt;Head&gt;` React component from the `@react-email/head` package, which is used to render the `&lt;head&gt;` section of an HTML email. The tests ensure that the component correctly renders its children, outputs the expected HTML structure, and handles `&lt;style&gt;` tags within its content.

## Symbols

### `describe`
#### Description
This function defines a suite of tests for the `&lt;Head&gt;` component.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| description | string | A description of the component being tested. |
| callback | function | A function that contains the individual test cases. |

#### Outputs
None. This function is used for structuring tests and does not return a value.

#### Internal Logic
The `describe` function is provided by the Jest testing framework. It groups together related test cases and provides a description that is displayed in the test output.

### `it`
#### Description
This function defines an individual test case within the `describe` block.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| description | string | A description of the specific behavior being tested. |
| callback | function | A function that contains the test logic, including assertions. |

#### Outputs
None. This function is used for defining test cases and does not return a value.

#### Internal Logic
The `it` function, also provided by Jest, defines a single test case. It runs the provided callback function, and any failed assertions within the callback will cause the test to fail.

### Test Cases
The code includes three test cases within the `describe` block:

1. **"renders children correctly"**: This test case verifies that any children passed to the `&lt;Head&gt;` component are rendered within the `&lt;head&gt;` tag in the output HTML. It uses the `render` function to render the component and then asserts that the resulting HTML contains the expected text.

2. **"renders correctly"**: This test case checks the basic rendering of the `&lt;Head&gt;` component without any children. It asserts that the rendered output matches a snapshot of the expected HTML structure, which includes the doctype declaration, `&lt;head&gt;` tag, and default meta tags.

3. **"renders style tags"**: This test case ensures that `&lt;style&gt;` tags passed as children to the `&lt;Head&gt;` component are correctly included within the `&lt;head&gt;` tag in the output. It renders the component with a `&lt;style&gt;` tag containing CSS rules and asserts that the rendered HTML includes the style tag and its content.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @react-email/render | Provides the `render` function for server-side rendering React components to HTML. |
| jest | Testing framework used for running and asserting the test cases. |

## Error Handling
The tests rely on the Jest framework for error handling. Any failed assertions within the test cases will throw errors, causing the respective test case to fail and be reported by Jest.
