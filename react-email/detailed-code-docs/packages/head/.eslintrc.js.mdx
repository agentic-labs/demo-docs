## High-level description
This ESLint configuration file extends the `custom/react-internal` configuration, which is designed for internal React libraries bundled by their consumers. It sets up linting rules specifically for this context.

## References
- `custom/react-internal`: This configuration is defined in the `packages/eslint-config-custom/react-internal.js` file.

## Symbols
### `module.exports`
#### Description
This symbol defines the ESLint configuration object that extends the `custom/react-internal` configuration.

#### Internal Logic
The code sets the `extends` property of the `module.exports` object to an array containing a single string: `"custom/react-internal"`. This indicates that the current ESLint configuration inherits all the rules and settings defined in the `custom/react-internal` configuration.
