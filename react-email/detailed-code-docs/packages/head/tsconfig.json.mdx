title: "tsconfig.json"
---

## High-level description
This file, `tsconfig.json`, is a configuration file for TypeScript. It defines the TypeScript compiler options specifically for the `head` package within a larger project. The configuration leverages a shared base configuration, "tsconfig/react-library.json", and customizes it for this specific package.

## Symbols
### `tsconfig.json`
#### Description
This file defines the TypeScript compiler options for the `head` package. It extends a base configuration file and specifies included and excluded directories.

#### Inputs
This file does not take any inputs. It is a configuration file read by the TypeScript compiler.

#### Outputs
This file does not produce any direct outputs. It influences the behavior of the TypeScript compiler.

#### Internal Logic
- **`"extends": "tsconfig/react-library.json"`**: This line indicates that the configuration inherits settings from a base configuration file located at "tsconfig/react-library.json". This promotes consistency and avoids redundancy in configuration across the project.
- **`"include": ["."]`**: This line specifies that the TypeScript compiler should include all files within the current directory (the `head` package directory) for compilation.
- **`"exclude": ["dist", "build", "node_modules"]`**: This line excludes specific directories from compilation. These are typically output directories ("dist", "build") and the "node_modules" directory, which contains external dependencies that should not be recompiled.

## Dependencies
This configuration file implicitly depends on the TypeScript compiler and the base configuration file it extends.

- **TypeScript Compiler**: The file is interpreted by the TypeScript compiler (`tsc`) to determine compilation settings.
- **tsconfig/react-library.json**: This base configuration file likely contains settings common to React libraries within the project.
