title: "next.js"

## High-level description
This code defines a custom ESLint configuration specifically tailored for Next.js applications. It extends the Vercel Engineering Style Guide and includes rules for Node.js, browser environments, TypeScript, React, and Next.js. 

## References
This configuration references the Vercel Engineering Style Guide, which can be found at: https://github.com/vercel/style-guide

## Symbols
### `module.exports`
#### Description
This symbol defines and exports the ESLint configuration object. It extends several base configurations, sets parser options, defines global variables, configures import resolution, specifies ignored patterns, and overrides specific ESLint rules.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Extends Base Configurations:**
   - It extends a chain of ESLint configurations from Vercel's style guide, covering Node.js, browser, TypeScript, React, and Next.js environments.
   - It also includes the "eslint-config-turbo" and "eslint-config-prettier" configurations.
2. **Parser Options:**
   - Sets the `project` option to the path of the project's `tsconfig.json` file, enabling ESLint to leverage TypeScript type information for better linting.
3. **Globals:**
   - Defines `React` and `JSX` as global variables, preventing unnecessary import statements in `.jsx` and `.tsx` files.
4. **Import Resolution:**
   - Configures the ESLint import resolver to use TypeScript for resolving module imports, ensuring accurate path resolution and type checking.
5. **Ignored Patterns:**
   - Specifies `node_modules/` and `dist/` directories to be ignored during linting, preventing unnecessary checks on external dependencies and build artifacts.
6. **Rule Overrides:**
   - Overrides specific ESLint rules to either disable them (`"off"`) or customize their behavior. 
   - For instance, it disables the `@next/next/no-img-element` rule, allows default exports, and configures the `react/function-component-definition` rule to enforce arrow function syntax for React functional components.
