## High-level description
This file defines the `eslint-config-custom` package, which is an ESLint configuration used across the project. It sets up a private package with no public API, relying on specific versions of development dependencies for linting rules and code style enforcement.

## References
- `@vercel/style-guide`: Provides Vercel's recommended ESLint configuration.
- `eslint-config-prettier`: Integrates Prettier, a code formatter, with ESLint.
- `eslint-config-turbo`:  Likely related to code optimization or build process speed, but its specific role in this context is unclear without further context.
- `typescript`:  Allows ESLint to understand and lint TypeScript code.

## Symbols
This file does not contain any code symbols like functions or classes. It is a configuration file in JSON format.
