## High-level description
The `packages/eslint-config-custom` directory houses custom ESLint configurations for a project, likely related to the Turbo build system and Vercel's Engineering Style Guide. It provides specialized linting rules for different parts of the codebase, including TypeScript packages, Next.js applications, and internal React libraries.

## What does it do?
This directory acts as a central repository for defining consistent code style and linting rules across the project. It leverages ESLint, a popular JavaScript linting tool, to enforce these rules. The configurations in this directory extend the Vercel Engineering Style Guide, a set of opinionated ESLint configurations, and integrate with Prettier, a code formatter, to ensure a unified code style.

## Entry points
The main entry points for developers are the configuration files themselves:

- `library.js`: Defines the base ESLint configuration for TypeScript packages.
- `next.js`:  Provides a specialized configuration for Next.js applications.
- `react-internal.js`: Sets up linting rules for internal React libraries.

These configurations are likely referenced in the `.eslintrc.js` files of other packages or directories within the project.

## Key Files
- **`library.js`**: This file defines the foundation for linting TypeScript packages within the project. It extends Vercel's style guide for Node.js and TypeScript, integrates Prettier, and sets up essential configurations like parser options, global variables, and import resolution.
- **`next.js`**:  Tailored for Next.js applications, this configuration builds upon the base TypeScript configuration and adds rules specific to Next.js, React, and browser environments. It ensures adherence to best practices for Next.js development.
- **`react-internal.js`**:  This file focuses on linting internal React libraries. It extends Vercel's style guide for browser-based TypeScript and React projects, disables or modifies rules specific to this use case, and integrates Prettier for consistent formatting.

## Dependencies
The ESLint configurations in this directory rely on several external libraries:

- **`@vercel/style-guide`**: This package provides Vercel's recommended ESLint rules and configurations, serving as the foundation for the project's code style.
- **`eslint-config-prettier`**: This dependency integrates Prettier, a code formatter, with ESLint, ensuring that formatting-related rules don't conflict and that the codebase maintains a consistent style.
- **`eslint-config-turbo`**: While its exact purpose is unclear without further context, this dependency likely relates to code optimization or build process speed within the Turbo build system.
- **`typescript`**: This dependency enables ESLint to understand and lint TypeScript code, essential for projects using TypeScript.
