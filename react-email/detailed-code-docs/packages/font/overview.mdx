## High-level description
The `packages/font` directory contains the implementation of a React component called `Font`, which is designed to embed custom fonts in email templates. This package is part of the React Email project and provides a way to set font families in email content, ensuring consistent typography across different email clients.

## What does it do?
The `Font` component allows developers to:
1. Specify a custom font family for use in email templates.
2. Define fallback font families for cases where the custom font isn't available.
3. Load web fonts by providing a URL and format.
4. Inject the necessary `@font-face` CSS rules into the email's `&lt;head&gt;` section.

This functionality enhances the visual consistency and branding of email templates by allowing the use of custom fonts while maintaining fallback options for compatibility across various email clients.

## Key Files
1. `src/font.tsx`: Contains the main implementation of the `Font` component.
2. `src/index.ts`: Serves as the entry point for the package, exporting the `Font` component.
3. `src/font.spec.tsx`: Includes unit tests for the `Font` component.

## Dependencies
- `react`: The core library for building the component (versions 18 and 19 supported).
- `@react-email/render`: Used in testing to render the component into HTML.

## Configuration
The package uses the following configuration files:
1. `.eslintrc.js`: Extends the `custom/react-internal` ESLint configuration.
2. `tsconfig.json`: Configures TypeScript compilation, extending from a base React library configuration.

## Example Usage
```jsx
import { Html } from "@react-email/html";
import { Head } from "@react-email/head";
import { Font } from "@react-email/font";

const Email = () =&gt; {
  return (
    &lt;Html lang="en"&gt;
      &lt;Head&gt;
        &lt;Font
          fontFamily="Roboto"
          fallbackFontFamily="Verdana"
          webFont={{
            url: "https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/roboto/v27/KFOmCnqEu92Fr1Mu4mxKKTU1Kg.woff2",
            format: "woff2",
          }}
        /&gt;
      &lt;/Head&gt;
    &lt;/Html&gt;
  );
};
```

This example demonstrates how to use the `Font` component to include the Roboto font in an email template, with Verdana as a fallback. The component will generate the necessary `@font-face` CSS rule and inject it into the email's `&lt;head&gt;` section.

The package is designed to be compatible with popular email clients, including Gmail, Apple Mail, Outlook, Yahoo! Mail, HEY, and Superhuman. It's distributed under the MIT License and is available for installation via npm or yarn.
