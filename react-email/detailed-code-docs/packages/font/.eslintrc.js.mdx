## High-level description
This code defines the ESLint configuration for the `font` package, extending the `custom/react-internal` configuration. This suggests that the `font` package is an internal React library.

## References
- `custom/react-internal`: This configuration, defined in `packages/eslint-config-custom/react-internal.js`, serves as the base for the `font` package's linting rules.

## Symbols
### `module.exports`
#### Description
This symbol defines the ESLint configuration object for the `font` package. It extends the `custom/react-internal` configuration, inheriting its rules and settings.

#### Internal Logic
The configuration object has a single property:

- `extends`: This property specifies that the current configuration extends the `custom/react-internal` configuration. This means that the `font` package will inherit all the rules, plugins, and settings defined in the `custom/react-internal` configuration.

## Dependencies
This configuration file implicitly depends on the `custom/react-internal` ESLint configuration, which is defined in a separate file.
