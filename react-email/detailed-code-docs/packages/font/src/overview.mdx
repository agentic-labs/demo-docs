## High-level description
The `packages/font/src` directory houses the implementation of a React component designed for embedding custom fonts in web applications, particularly focusing on email templates. It leverages the `@font-face` CSS rule to load and apply custom fonts, ensuring compatibility across various email clients.

## What does it do?
This code introduces a React component named `Font`. When used in an email template, this component allows developers to incorporate custom fonts, enhancing the email's visual appeal and brand consistency. It achieves this by injecting a `&lt;style&gt;` tag directly into the `&lt;head&gt;` section of the HTML document. This `&lt;style&gt;` tag contains the necessary `@font-face` CSS rule, which instructs the email client to download and apply the specified custom font.

For scenarios where the custom font might not be available or supported, the component allows developers to define fallback fonts. These fallback fonts act as alternatives, ensuring that the email content remains readable even if the primary custom font fails to load.

## Entry points
The primary entry point for developers using this component is `index.ts`. This file exports the `Font` component, which can be imported and used directly in React applications.

The `font.tsx` file contains the core implementation of the `Font` component, handling font loading, fallback mechanisms, and CSS generation.

For testing purposes, `font.spec.tsx` houses a suite of tests that validate the functionality and rendering behavior of the `Font` component.

Data flows from the props provided to the `Font` component in `index.ts` to the internal logic of the component in `font.tsx`, where it's used to generate the appropriate CSS. This CSS is then injected into the document's `&lt;head&gt;` as a `&lt;style&gt;` tag.

## Dependencies
- `react`: This dependency is fundamental, as it provides the necessary React library functions for creating and managing components.
- `@react-email/render` (used in `font.spec.tsx`): This dependency is specifically used within the testing environment. It facilitates the rendering of the `Font` component into its HTML representation, allowing for assertions and validations against the expected output.
