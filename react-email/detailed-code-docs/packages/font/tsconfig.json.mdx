title: "tsconfig.json"

## High-level description
This file, `tsconfig.json`, is a configuration file for TypeScript. It defines the TypeScript compiler options specifically for the `font` package within a larger project. This configuration sets up the project as a React library and specifies the source files to include and exclude during compilation.

## Symbols
### `tsconfig.json`
#### Description
This JSON object defines the TypeScript compiler options for the `font` package. It inherits base configurations from `"tsconfig/react-library.json"` and customizes the include and exclude patterns for this specific package.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a configuration file, not a function or method.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a configuration file, not a function or method.

#### Internal Logic
- `"extends": "tsconfig/react-library.json"`: This line indicates that this configuration inherits settings from a shared base configuration file likely optimized for React libraries.
- `"include": ["."]`: This line specifies that all files within the current directory (`.`) should be included for compilation.
- `"exclude": ["dist", "build", "node_modules"]`: This line excludes the specified directories (`dist`, `build`, `node_modules`) from compilation. These directories likely contain build artifacts, output files, or external dependencies that shouldn't be processed by the TypeScript compiler.

## Dependencies
This configuration file depends on a base configuration file:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `tsconfig/react-library.json` | Provides base TypeScript compiler options for React libraries.
