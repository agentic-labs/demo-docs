## High-level description
The `packages/code-inline` directory contains a React component library called `@react-email/code-inline`. This library provides a component for displaying inline code snippets in email templates, ensuring compatibility across various email clients, with special consideration for the Orange.fr email client.

## What does it do?
The `CodeInline` component renders inline code snippets within email templates. It uses a combination of HTML tags (`&lt;code&gt;` and `&lt;span&gt;`) and targeted CSS styles to ensure proper display across different email clients. The component is particularly designed to address rendering issues in the Orange.fr email client while maintaining compatibility with other popular clients like Gmail, Apple Mail, Outlook, Yahoo! Mail, HEY, and Superhuman.

## Key Files

### src/code-inline.tsx
This file contains the main implementation of the `CodeInline` component. It uses React's `forwardRef` to allow passing refs to the underlying DOM elements. The component renders both a `&lt;code&gt;` element for most email clients and a `&lt;span&gt;` element specifically styled for Orange.fr. CSS rules control which element is visible based on the email client.

### src/index.ts
This is the main entry point for the package, exporting the `CodeInline` component for use in other parts of an application.

### package.json
Defines the package configuration, including:
- Package name: `@react-email/code-inline`
- Version: `0.0.4`
- Build scripts using `tsup`
- Peer dependency on React (versions ^18.0 || ^19.0 || ^19.0.0-rc)
- Development dependencies for building, linting, and testing

### tsconfig.json
Specifies TypeScript compiler options for the package, extending a base configuration for React libraries.

## Dependencies
The package has a peer dependency on React and uses several development tools:
- `tsup` for building the package
- `typescript` for TypeScript support
- `vitest` for testing (though no test script is defined in the package.json)
- `eslint` for linting the code

## Configuration
The package uses ESLint for code linting, with a configuration that extends `custom/react-internal`. This ensures consistency with the broader project's coding standards for internal React libraries.

The `tsconfig.json` file extends a base configuration for React libraries and excludes `dist`, `build`, and `node_modules` directories from compilation.

## Additional Context
The package is part of a larger React Email project, which aims to provide components for creating email templates using React. It's designed to be used in conjunction with other React Email components to create full email layouts.

The component has been tested and confirmed to work with major email clients, as indicated in the readme.md file. This ensures broad compatibility for email template developers using this library.
