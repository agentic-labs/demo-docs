## High-level description
This directory contains a React component called `CodeInline` designed for rendering inline code snippets. Its primary function is to ensure the proper display of code within different email clients, particularly addressing compatibility issues with the Orange.fr email client.

## What does it do?
The `CodeInline` component provides a way to display code snippets within an email while accounting for the rendering quirks of different email clients. It achieves this by employing a combination of standard HTML tags like `&lt;code&gt;` and `&lt;span&gt;` along with targeted CSS styles. This approach ensures that the code is displayed correctly in most email clients while applying specific styling for Orange.fr to overcome its rendering limitations.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this component is `index.ts`. It exports the `CodeInline` component, making it accessible to other parts of the application. The implementation of the component itself resides in `code-inline.tsx`.

## Key Files

### code-inline.tsx
This file contains the implementation of the `CodeInline` React component. It utilizes React's `forwardRef` to allow passing refs to the underlying DOM elements. The component renders both a `&lt;code&gt;` element, intended for most email clients, and a `&lt;span&gt;` element specifically styled for Orange.fr. The choice of which element is visible is controlled by CSS rules that target the specific email client.

## Dependencies
This component relies on React for its core functionality and utilizes React types for type safety.
