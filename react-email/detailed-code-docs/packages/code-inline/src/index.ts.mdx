## High-level description
This file serves as the main entry point for the `code-inline` package. It exports all the symbols from the `code-inline` module, making them available for use by other parts of the application or external consumers.

## Symbols

### `export * from "./code-inline"`
#### Description
This statement performs a re-export of all named exports from the `"./code-inline"` module. It allows consumers of this package to import the `CodeInline` component and its associated types directly from the package root, without needing to know the internal file structure.

## References
The code in this file references the `"./code-inline"` module, which contains the actual implementation of the `CodeInline` component and its related types.

## Dependencies
This file doesn't directly import any external libraries, but it relies on the `"./code-inline"` module, which uses React.

Based on the related code snippet provided, we can infer that the following symbols are likely being exported:

1. `CodeInlineProps`: A type representing the props for the `CodeInline` component.
2. `CodeInline`: A React component for rendering inline code with special handling for the Orange.fr email client.

These exports make the `CodeInline` component and its props type available for use in other parts of the application or by external consumers of the package.
