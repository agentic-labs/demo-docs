## High-level description
This code configures ESLint for a React-based internal package named "code-inline". It extends a custom ESLint configuration specifically designed for internal React libraries.

## Code Structure
The file exports a single configuration object that extends the "custom/react-internal" ESLint configuration.

## Symbols

### module.exports
#### Description
This is the main export of the ESLint configuration file. It defines the ESLint rules and settings for the "code-inline" package.

#### Inputs
N/A

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| extends | Array | An array containing the ESLint configuration to extend |

#### Internal Logic
The configuration extends a single custom ESLint configuration named "custom/react-internal".

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| custom/react-internal | Custom ESLint configuration for internal React libraries |

## References
The "custom/react-internal" configuration is likely defined in the related file "packages/eslint-config-custom/react-internal.js".

## Additional Context
Based on the related code snippet provided, the "custom/react-internal" configuration (defined in "packages/eslint-config-custom/react-internal.js") is a comprehensive ESLint setup for internal React libraries. It includes the following key features:

1. Extends multiple configurations from the Vercel Engineering Style Guide.
2. Sets up parser options for TypeScript.
3. Configures the environment for Node.js.
4. Sets up import resolution for TypeScript projects.
5. Ignores certain directories and files.
6. Overrides several ESLint rules to customize the linting behavior for React and TypeScript projects.

By extending this configuration, the "code-inline" package inherits a well-defined set of linting rules and settings suitable for internal React libraries, ensuring consistency with the broader project's coding standards.
