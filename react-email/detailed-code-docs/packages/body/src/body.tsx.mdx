## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `Body` that represents an HTML `&lt;body&gt;` element. It provides a flexible wrapper for the `&lt;body&gt;` tag, allowing users to pass props and a ref to customize its behavior and appearance.

## Symbols

### `BodyProps`
#### Description
`BodyProps` is a type alias that defines the props accepted by the `Body` component. It extends the standard HTML attributes for a `&lt;body&gt;` element.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| N/A | React.HtmlHTMLAttributes&lt;HTMLBodyElement&gt; | All standard HTML attributes for a body element |

### `Body`
#### Description
`Body` is a React component that renders an HTML `&lt;body&gt;` element. It uses `React.forwardRef` to allow passing a ref to the underlying `&lt;body&gt;` element.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| children | React.ReactNode | The content to be rendered inside the body element |
| style | React.CSSProperties | Optional inline styles for the body element |
| ...props | BodyProps | Any additional HTML attributes for the body element |
| ref | React.Ref&lt;HTMLBodyElement&gt; | A ref object to access the underlying HTML body element |

#### Outputs
Returns a React element representing the `&lt;body&gt;` tag with the provided props, children, and ref.

#### Internal Logic
1. The component destructures `children` and `style` from the props, with the rest of the props spread into `...props`.
2. It returns a `&lt;body&gt;` element with all the provided props spread onto it.
3. The `ref` is attached to the `&lt;body&gt;` element for external access.
4. The `style` prop is passed directly to the `style` attribute of the `&lt;body&gt;` element.
5. The `children` are rendered inside the `&lt;body&gt;` element.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| React | Used for creating the functional component and utilizing `forwardRef` |

## Notes
- The `Body` component is given a `displayName` of "Body", which can be useful for debugging purposes.
- The component is exported, making it available for use in other parts of the application.
- The `index.ts` file in the same directory re-exports everything from `body.tsx`, suggesting that this component is meant to be the main export of the `body` package.

This component provides a clean, reusable way to create and customize the `&lt;body&gt;` element in a React application, allowing for easy integration of body-level props and refs in a type-safe manner.
