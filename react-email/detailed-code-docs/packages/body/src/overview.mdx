## High-level description
This directory contains the source code for the `&lt;Body&gt;` component of the React Email library. The `&lt;Body&gt;` component is a fundamental building block for creating email templates, allowing developers to structure the main content area of an email.

## What does it do?
The code defines a React component named `&lt;Body&gt;` that represents the `&lt;body&gt;` tag in an HTML email. This component acts as a container for the main content of the email, such as text, images, and other elements. It allows developers to easily style and structure the email body using familiar React patterns.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this directory is `index.ts`, which re-exports the `&lt;Body&gt;` component and its associated types. Developers using this library would import the `&lt;Body&gt;` component from this entry point.

## Key Files

### `body.tsx`
This file defines the `&lt;Body&gt;` React component. It handles rendering the `&lt;body&gt;` HTML tag with appropriate styling and attributes passed as props. The component also utilizes `React.forwardRef` to allow parent components to access the underlying DOM element for advanced use cases.

### `body.spec.tsx`
This file contains unit tests for the `&lt;Body&gt;` component. These tests ensure that the component renders correctly, applies styles and props as expected, and produces the correct HTML output. The tests provide confidence in the component's functionality and prevent regressions during development.

## Dependencies

### `React`
This dependency is used for creating the functional component and utilizing `forwardRef`.

### `@react-email/render`
This dependency provides the `render` function used to render React components to HTML in the test file.
