## High-level description
This code is an index file that re-exports all the contents from the "./body" module. It serves as a central point of access for the Body component and its related types, allowing users to import them from the package's root.

## Code Structure
The file contains a single line of code that uses the ES6 export syntax to re-export all named exports from the "./body" module.

## References
- "./body": This file references and re-exports all contents from the "./body" module.

## Symbols

### `export * from "./body"`
#### Description
This statement re-exports all named exports from the "./body" module. It allows users to import the `Body` component and `BodyProps` type directly from the package root instead of having to specify the full path to the "body" module.

#### Inputs
This export statement doesn't have any inputs.

#### Outputs
This export statement doesn't have any direct outputs. However, it makes all named exports from the "./body" module available to importers of this index file.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| "./body" | The module containing the `Body` component and `BodyProps` type that are being re-exported. |

Based on the related code snippet provided, we can infer that this index file is re-exporting the following:

1. `Body`: A React component that renders an HTML `&lt;body&gt;` element.
2. `BodyProps`: A type definition for the props of the `Body` component.

These re-exports allow users of the package to import the `Body` component and `BodyProps` type like this:

```typescript
import { Body, BodyProps } from 'package-name';
```

Instead of:

```typescript
import { Body, BodyProps } from 'package-name/body';
```

This approach simplifies imports and provides a cleaner API for the package users.
