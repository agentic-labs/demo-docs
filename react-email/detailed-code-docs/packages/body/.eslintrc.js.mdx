## High-level description
This code defines an ESLint configuration for a React-based project within a monorepo structure. It extends a custom ESLint configuration specifically designed for internal React libraries.

## Code Structure
The code exports a single configuration object using CommonJS module syntax.

## Symbols

### module.exports
#### Description
This is the main configuration object exported by the module. It extends a custom ESLint configuration named "custom/react-internal".

#### Internal Logic
The configuration uses the `extends` property to inherit rules from the "custom/react-internal" configuration. This approach allows for consistent linting rules across different packages within the monorepo that use React internally.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| custom/react-internal | Provides the base ESLint configuration for internal React libraries |

## References
The configuration references the "custom/react-internal" ESLint configuration, which is likely defined in another file within the monorepo structure.

## Notes
1. This configuration is specifically tailored for a package named "body" within a monorepo structure.
2. By extending "custom/react-internal", it inherits a set of ESLint rules optimized for internal React libraries.
3. The use of a shared configuration promotes consistency across different packages in the monorepo.

Based on the related code snippet provided, we can infer that the "custom/react-internal" configuration:

1. Extends multiple configurations from the Vercel Engineering Style Guide.
2. Sets up specific parser options, environment settings, and global variables.
3. Configures import resolution for TypeScript projects.
4. Defines custom rules and overrides for React and TypeScript linting.

This setup ensures that the "body" package follows best practices and coding standards established for the entire project or organization.
