## High-level description

This file is a TypeScript configuration file (`tsconfig.json`) for the "body" package. It extends a base configuration for React libraries and specifies which files to include and exclude from the TypeScript compilation process.

## Symbols

### Configuration Object

#### Description

The configuration object defines the TypeScript compiler options for the "body" package. It extends a base configuration and specifies include and exclude patterns for files to be processed by the TypeScript compiler.

#### Internal Logic

1. The configuration extends a base configuration file named "react-library.json" from the "tsconfig" package.
2. It includes all files in the current directory and its subdirectories.
3. It excludes files in the "dist", "build", and "node_modules" directories from compilation.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| tsconfig/react-library.json | Base TypeScript configuration for React libraries |

Note: The "tsconfig" package is likely a custom package containing shared TypeScript configurations for different project types within the organization.

## Configuration

| Option | Type | Value | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------|:------------|
| extends | string | "tsconfig/react-library.json" | Specifies the base configuration file to extend |
| include | array | ["."] | Defines patterns for files to include in compilation |
| exclude | array | ["dist", "build", "node_modules"] | Defines patterns for files to exclude from compilation |

This configuration ensures that the TypeScript compiler processes all relevant files for the "body" package while excluding generated files (dist, build) and third-party dependencies (node_modules). It also inherits settings from a shared configuration file specifically designed for React libraries.
