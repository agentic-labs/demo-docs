title: "tsconfig.json"
---

## High-level description
This file defines the TypeScript compiler configuration for the `row` package, which is likely a component library or a utility package for handling rows in a user interface. It inherits settings from a shared React library configuration and specifies included and excluded directories for compilation.

## Symbols
### `tsconfig.json`
#### Description
This file configures the TypeScript compiler for the `row` package. It extends a base configuration for React libraries and customizes the include and exclude paths for this specific package.

#### Internal Logic
- **`extends`**: Inherits settings from the `"tsconfig/react-library.json"` file, providing a base configuration for React projects.
- **`include`**: Specifies that only files within the current directory (`.`) should be included in the compilation process.
- **`exclude`**: Excludes the `dist`, `build`, and `node_modules` directories from the compilation process. These directories typically contain build artifacts, generated files, or external dependencies that shouldn't be compiled by TypeScript.
