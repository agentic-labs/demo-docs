## High-level description
This directory contains the source code for the `Row` component, a fundamental building block for creating email layouts in the application. The `Row` component represents a single row within an HTML email table, ensuring consistent rendering across various email clients.

## What does it do?
The `Row` component simplifies the process of building responsive email layouts by abstracting away the complexities of HTML table-based layouts. Instead of manually writing HTML `&lt;table&gt;`, `&lt;tr&gt;`, and `&lt;td&gt;` tags, developers can use the `Row` component to define rows within their email templates. The component takes care of rendering the necessary HTML structure, including a full-width table wrapper and a single table row, while allowing developers to focus on the content within each row.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this component is `index.ts`, which exports the `Row` component defined in `row.tsx`. The `row.spec.tsx` file contains unit tests for the `Row` component.

## Key Files
- **`row.tsx`**: This file defines the `Row` component as a React functional component. It utilizes `React.forwardRef` to allow access to the underlying `&lt;table&gt;` element. The component renders a `&lt;table&gt;` element with specific attributes to ensure email compatibility, including centering the table, setting full width, removing borders, padding, and spacing, and specifying the role as "presentation". Inside the table, it renders a `&lt;tbody&gt;` element with a single `&lt;tr&gt;` element containing the provided children.

- **`row.spec.tsx`**: This file contains unit tests for the `Row` component. It utilizes a testing library to render the `Row` component with different props and assert the output HTML. The tests ensure that the component renders correctly with various combinations of children and props.

## Dependencies
- **`react`**: This dependency provides the core React functionality for creating components.

- **`@react-email/render`**: This dependency is used in the test file (`row.spec.tsx`) to render the React component to HTML for testing purposes.
