## High-level description
The `packages/row` directory contains the source code and configuration files for the `@react-email/row` package. This package provides a React component for creating rows in email templates, which is an essential building block for constructing responsive email layouts.

## What does it do?
The `Row` component simplifies the process of creating HTML email layouts by abstracting away the complexities of table-based structures. It renders a full-width table wrapper with a single table row, allowing developers to focus on the content within each row rather than dealing with the intricacies of HTML email compatibility. This component is designed to work seamlessly with other React Email components like `Section` and `Column` to create complex, responsive email layouts that render consistently across various email clients.

## Key Files
1. `src/row.tsx`: This file defines the `Row` component as a React functional component using `React.forwardRef`. It renders a `&lt;table&gt;` element with specific attributes for email compatibility, including a `&lt;tbody&gt;` and `&lt;tr&gt;` element to contain the provided children.

2. `src/row.spec.tsx`: Contains unit tests for the `Row` component, ensuring it renders correctly with different props and children.

3. `package.json`: Defines the package metadata, scripts, dependencies, and configuration for building, testing, and publishing the component.

4. `tsconfig.json`: Configures the TypeScript compiler for the package, extending a shared React library configuration.

5. `.eslintrc.js`: Specifies the ESLint configuration for the package, extending a custom React internal configuration.

## Dependencies
The package has the following key dependencies:
- `react`: Core React library for component development.
- `@react-email/render`: Used for rendering React components to HTML in tests.
- `typescript`: For type checking and compilation.

## Configuration
The package is configured with:
- TypeScript support, with compilation settings defined in `tsconfig.json`.
- ESLint for code linting, extending a custom React internal configuration.
- Scripts for building, testing, and linting the package.
- Peer dependency on React versions 18.0, 19.0, or 19.0.0-rc.

The `Row` component is designed to be highly compatible with various email clients, including Gmail, Apple Mail, Outlook, Yahoo! Mail, HEY, and Superhuman.

## Code Example
Here's a basic example of how to use the `Row` component:

```jsx
import { Section } from "@react-email/section";
import { Row } from "@react-email/row";
import { Column } from "@react-email/column";

const Email = () =&gt; {
  return (
    &lt;Section&gt;
      &lt;Row&gt;
        &lt;Column&gt;Content for the first row&lt;/Column&gt;
      &lt;/Row&gt;
      &lt;Row&gt;
        &lt;Column&gt;Content for the second row&lt;/Column&gt;
      &lt;/Row&gt;
    &lt;/Section&gt;
  );
};
```

This example demonstrates how the `Row` component can be used in conjunction with `Section` and `Column` components to create a simple email layout structure.
