## High-level description
This code defines the ESLint configuration for the `row` package, extending a custom ESLint configuration called `react-internal`. This suggests that the `row` package is an internal React library.

## References
- `custom/react-internal`: This configuration is defined in the `packages/eslint-config-custom/react-internal.js` file.

## Symbols
### `module.exports`
#### Description
This symbol defines the ESLint configuration object for the `row` package. It extends the `custom/react-internal` configuration, inheriting its rules and settings.

#### Internal Logic
The configuration object has a single property:

- `extends`: This property specifies that the configuration extends the `custom/react-internal` configuration. This means that the `row` package will inherit all the ESLint rules, plugins, and settings defined in the `react-internal` configuration.

## Dependencies
This configuration file implicitly depends on the `custom/react-internal` ESLint configuration, which is defined in a separate file.
