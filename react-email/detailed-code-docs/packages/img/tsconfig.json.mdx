title: "tsconfig.json"

## High-level description
This file, `tsconfig.json`, configures the TypeScript compiler for the `img` package. It specifies the TypeScript configuration to use, includes all files in the current directory, and excludes specific directories.

## Symbols
### `tsconfig.json`
#### Description
This file defines the TypeScript compiler options for the `img` package. It extends a base configuration file (`tsconfig/react-library.json`) and customizes the include and exclude paths.

#### Internal Logic
- **extends**: Extends the configuration from the `tsconfig/react-library.json` file, inheriting its settings. This promotes consistency and avoids redundancy in configuration across different packages.
- **include**: Specifies the files to include in the compilation process. In this case, `"."` indicates that all files in the current directory should be included.
- **exclude**: Specifies the files and directories to exclude from the compilation process. This configuration excludes the `dist`, `build`, and `node_modules` directories, which typically contain build artifacts, generated files, and external dependencies, respectively.

## Dependencies
This configuration file implicitly depends on the `tsconfig/react-library.json` file, indicating a dependency on a shared TypeScript configuration for React libraries within the project.
