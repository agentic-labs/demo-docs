## High-level description
This code defines the ESLint configuration for the `img` package, extending a custom React configuration for internal libraries. It leverages Vercel's Engineering Style Guide for consistent code style within the project.

## References
- `custom/react-internal`: This configuration is defined in the `packages/eslint-config-custom/react-internal.js` file.

## Symbols
### `module.exports`
#### Description
This symbol defines the ESLint configuration object that will be used for linting files within the `img` package.

#### Internal Logic
The configuration object extends the `custom/react-internal` configuration, which is a custom ESLint configuration designed for internal React libraries within the project. This approach allows for a centralized and reusable ESLint configuration for similar projects.

## Dependencies
This code snippet doesn't directly declare dependencies. However, it extends the `custom/react-internal` configuration, which relies on the following dependencies:

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @vercel/style-guide | Provides the base ESLint rules based on Vercel's Engineering Style Guide. |
| eslint-config-prettier | Disables ESLint rules that conflict with Prettier, ensuring consistent code formatting. |
