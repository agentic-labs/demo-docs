## High-level description
The `packages/img` directory contains the implementation of a React component called `Img`, which is part of the `react-email` project. This component is designed to display images in email templates with consistent styling across various email clients. The package includes the component source code, unit tests, configuration files, and documentation.

## What does it do?
The `Img` component serves as a wrapper around the standard HTML `&lt;img&gt;` tag, providing default styles and simplifying its usage within React-based email templates. It ensures consistent image rendering across different email clients by applying default styles such as `display: "block"`, `outline: "none"`, `border: "none"`, and `textDecoration: "none"`. Developers can use this component to easily embed images in their email templates while maintaining a consistent visual appearance.

## Key Files
1. `src/img.tsx`: Defines the `Img` React component, handling the logic for merging default styles with user-provided styles and rendering the final `&lt;img&gt;` tag.
2. `src/img.spec.tsx`: Contains unit tests for the `Img` component, ensuring correct prop passing and HTML output.
3. `src/index.ts`: Acts as the main entry point, re-exporting the `Img` component for use in applications.
4. `package.json`: Defines the package metadata, scripts, dependencies, and configurations.
5. `readme.md`: Provides documentation on how to install and use the `Img` component, including supported props and email client compatibility.

## Dependencies
The package has the following key dependencies:
- React (^18.0 || ^19.0 || ^19.0.0-rc): Core library for building the component.
- @react-email/render: Used for rendering the component to HTML in tests.
- TypeScript: For static typing and improved developer experience.
- ESLint and related plugins: For code linting and maintaining code quality.

## Configuration
The package uses several configuration files:
1. `tsconfig.json`: Configures the TypeScript compiler, extending a base configuration for React libraries.
2. `.eslintrc.js`: Defines ESLint rules, extending a custom React configuration for internal libraries.
3. `package.json`: Contains various configuration options, including:
   - Package name: `@react-email/img`
   - Version: `0.0.10`
   - Entry points for different module systems
   - Scripts for building, testing, and linting
   - Peer dependencies (React versions)
   - Publishing configuration
