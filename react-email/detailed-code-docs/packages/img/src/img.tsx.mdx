## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `Img` that renders an HTML `&lt;img&gt;` element with some default styling and forwarded props. It's designed to be a reusable image component with consistent styling across a React application, particularly useful in email templates or similar contexts where consistent image rendering is crucial.

## Symbols

### `ImgProps`
#### Description
A type alias for the props of the `Img` component, which are the same as the props for a standard HTML `&lt;img&gt;` element, excluding the `ref` prop.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| N/A | React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef&lt;"img"&gt; | All standard HTML img element props, excluding ref |

### `Img`
#### Description
A React component that renders an `&lt;img&gt;` element with default styling and forwarded props. It uses `React.forwardRef` to allow passing a ref to the underlying `&lt;img&gt;` element.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| props | ImgProps | The props for the Img component |
| ref | React.Ref&lt;HTMLImageElement&gt; | A ref that will be forwarded to the img element |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| N/A | JSX.Element | The rendered img element |

#### Internal Logic
1. Destructures `alt`, `src`, `width`, `height`, and `style` from the props.
2. Spreads the remaining props onto the `&lt;img&gt;` element.
3. Applies default styling to the `&lt;img&gt;` element:
   - `display: "block"`
   - `outline: "none"`
   - `border: "none"`
   - `textDecoration: "none"`
4. Merges any custom `style` prop with the default styles.
5. Sets the `ref` on the `&lt;img&gt;` element to allow external ref forwarding.

## Side Effects
This component has no side effects beyond rendering the `&lt;img&gt;` element.

## Performance Considerations
The component uses the `React.forwardRef` API, which has a slight performance overhead compared to regular functional components. However, this overhead is negligible in most cases and is outweighed by the benefits of ref forwarding.

## Dependencies
This component depends on the React library, imported as `* as React`.

## Notes
1. The `Img` component sets `Img.displayName = "Img"`, which is useful for debugging purposes in React DevTools.
2. The component uses the `Readonly` type to ensure that the props object is not mutated within the component.
3. The default styling applied to the image (block display, no outline, no border, no text decoration) is commonly used in email templates to ensure consistent rendering across different email clients.

Based on the related code snippets provided, it's clear that this `Img` component is part of a larger email template system. The `packages/react-email/src/utils/get-email-component.ts` file suggests that this component could be used within email templates that are dynamically loaded and rendered. The `packages/img/src/img.spec.tsx` file contains tests for the `Img` component, verifying its rendering behavior and prop handling.
