title: "img.spec.tsx"
---

## High-level description
This code defines a test suite for the `&lt;Img&gt;` React component, which is a wrapper around the native HTML `&lt;img&gt;` tag. The tests ensure that the component correctly passes props, including styles, and renders the expected HTML output.

## References
- `Img`: The `Img` component being tested is imported from `./index`.

## Symbols
### `describe('&lt;Img&gt; component', ...)`
#### Description
This function defines a test suite using Jest's `describe` function to group related tests. It focuses on testing the `&lt;Img&gt;` component.

#### Internal Logic
The suite includes two test cases:

1. **"passes style and other props correctly"**: This test renders the `&lt;Img&gt;` component with specific props, including inline styles and a `data-testid` attribute. It then asserts that the rendered HTML output contains the expected style rules and the `data-testid` attribute.
2. **"renders correctly"**: This test renders the `&lt;Img&gt;` component with basic props and asserts that the rendered HTML output matches the provided snapshot. The snapshot captures the expected HTML structure and attributes of the rendered `&lt;img&gt;` tag, including the default styles applied by the component.

## Dependencies
- `@react-email/render`: This library is used to render the `&lt;Img&gt;` component to HTML.
- `jest`: This library provides the testing framework and assertion functions like `describe`, `it`, `expect`, and `toMatchInlineSnapshot`.
