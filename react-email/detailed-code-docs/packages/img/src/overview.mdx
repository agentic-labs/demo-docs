## High-level description
The `packages/img/src` directory houses the implementation of a React component named `Img`. This component acts as a wrapper around the native HTML `&lt;img&gt;` tag, providing default styling and simplifying its usage within a React application. This is particularly beneficial in contexts like email templates where consistent image rendering across different email clients is crucial.

## What does it do?
The `Img` component allows developers to easily embed images in their React applications while ensuring a consistent visual style. It takes care of setting default styles like `display: "block"`, `outline: "none"`, `border: "none"`, and `textDecoration: "none"`, which are commonly used in email templates to ensure consistent rendering across email clients. Developers can still pass custom styles and other standard `&lt;img&gt;` tag attributes to the `Img` component, which will be applied in addition to the default styles.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this package is `index.ts`, which re-exports the `Img` component from `img.tsx`. Developers would import the `Img` component from this entry point to use it in their applications.

## Key Files
- **`img.tsx`**: This file defines the `Img` React component. It handles the logic for merging default styles with user-provided styles and renders the final `&lt;img&gt;` tag with all the specified attributes.
- **`img.spec.tsx`**: This file contains unit tests for the `Img` component, ensuring that it correctly passes props and renders the expected HTML output.

## Dependencies
- **React**: This is the core dependency for building React components.
- **@react-email/render**: This library is used in the test file (`img.spec.tsx`) to render the `Img` component to HTML for testing purposes.
- **jest**: This library provides the testing framework and assertion functions used in the test file (`img.spec.tsx`).
