## High-level description
This file serves as the main entry point for the `img` package. It re-exports all the symbols from the "./img" module, making them available to consumers of this package.

## Code Structure
The file contains a single line of code that uses the ES6 export syntax to re-export all symbols from the "./img" module.

## References
- "./img": This is likely another file or module within the same package that contains the main functionality for image-related operations.

## Symbols

### Export statement
#### Description
The `export * from "./img"` statement is used to re-export all named exports from the "./img" module. This means that any symbol (functions, classes, variables, etc.) that is exported from the "./img" module will be available as if it were directly exported from this file.

#### Inputs
This export statement doesn't have inputs in the traditional sense.

#### Outputs
All named exports from the "./img" module become available as exports from this file.

#### Internal Logic
The internal logic is handled by the JavaScript module system:
1. It imports all named exports from the "./img" module.
2. It then re-exports all of these imported symbols.

## Dependencies

| "./img" | Contains the main functionality for the `img` package |

This file acts as a convenient way to expose the package's functionality to its consumers. By using this approach, the package maintainers can organize their code into multiple files or modules internally while presenting a single entry point for users of the package. This pattern is commonly used in JavaScript/TypeScript packages to simplify the import process for end-users and to provide better control over the package's public API.
