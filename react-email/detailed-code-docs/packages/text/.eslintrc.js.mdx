## High-level description
This code defines the ESLint configuration for the `@twilio-paste/text` package, extending the custom "react-internal" configuration. This suggests that the package is a React library intended for internal use within Twilio Paste.

## References
- `custom/react-internal`: This reference points to an ESLint configuration preset likely defined in a separate file, possibly within the `packages/eslint-config-custom` directory. The related code snippets confirm this assumption, showing the definition of the `react-internal` configuration.

## Symbols
### `module.exports`
#### Description
This symbol exports an object that defines the ESLint configuration for the `@twilio-paste/text` package. It extends the `custom/react-internal` configuration, inheriting its rules and settings.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| value | Object | An object representing the ESLint configuration. |

#### Internal Logic
The configuration object has a single property:

- `extends`: This property specifies that the configuration should extend the `custom/react-internal` configuration. This means that the rules and settings defined in the `react-internal` configuration will be inherited by this configuration.

## Dependencies
The code indirectly depends on the following:

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| custom/react-internal | Provides a base ESLint configuration for internal React libraries within Twilio Paste. |
| @vercel/style-guide |  Likely used within `custom/react-internal` to enforce the Vercel Engineering Style Guide. |
| eslint-config-prettier | Likely used within `custom/react-internal` to integrate Prettier formatting rules. |
