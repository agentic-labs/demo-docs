title: "tsconfig.json"
---

## High-level description
This file defines the TypeScript compiler configuration for the `@react-email/text` package, which provides a text block component for React email templates. It extends a base configuration for React libraries and specifies included and excluded files for compilation.

## References
This configuration file references a base configuration file:
- `tsconfig/react-library.json`: This file likely contains common TypeScript compiler options for React libraries within the project.

## Symbols
### `extends: "tsconfig/react-library.json"`
#### Description
This property indicates that the current configuration inherits settings from the `tsconfig/react-library.json` file. This promotes consistency and avoids redundancy in TypeScript configurations across the project.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a configuration property, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a configuration property, not a function.

#### Internal Logic
N/A - This property simply references an external configuration file.

### `include: ["."]`
#### Description
This property specifies the files and directories to include in the TypeScript compilation process. In this case, `"."` indicates that all files and directories within the current directory should be included.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a configuration property, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a configuration property, not a function.

#### Internal Logic
N/A - This property defines a list of file patterns for inclusion.

### `exclude: ["dist", "build", "node_modules"]`
#### Description
This property specifies the files and directories to exclude from the TypeScript compilation process. 

- `"dist"` and `"build"` likely refer to directories containing compiled output, which should not be recompiled. 
- `"node_modules"` is a standard directory for storing external JavaScript libraries, which are typically excluded from compilation.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a configuration property, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a configuration property, not a function.

#### Internal Logic
N/A - This property defines a list of file patterns for exclusion.
