## High-level description
This file acts as the main entry point for the `text` package, exporting all named exports from the `./text` module. This allows other parts of the codebase to easily import and use the functionality provided by the `text` package.

## References
- `./text`: This module likely contains the core functionality related to text elements, such as components or utility functions.

## Symbols

### `*`
#### Description
This symbol re-exports all named exports from the `./text` module, making them available for use in other parts of the codebase.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a re-export statement, not a function or class.

#### Outputs
N/A - This statement itself doesn't return any specific value. It makes the exported symbols from `./text` available for use.

#### Internal Logic
This is a standard JavaScript module syntax for re-exporting. When another module imports from this file, they will have access to all the named exports originally defined in the `./text` module.
