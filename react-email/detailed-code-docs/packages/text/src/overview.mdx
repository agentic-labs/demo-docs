## High-level description
The `packages/text/src` directory houses the implementation of the `&lt;Text&gt;` React component for the `@react-email/text` package. This component provides a simple way to render text paragraphs within email templates, applying default styles suitable for email clients.

## What does it do?
This code defines a React component called `&lt;Text&gt;` that simplifies the process of adding text content to email templates. When used in an email template, the `&lt;Text&gt;` component renders as a standard HTML paragraph (`&lt;p&gt;`) with pre-defined styles for font size, line height, and margin. These default styles are chosen to ensure readability across different email clients. Developers can further customize the appearance of the text using standard HTML attributes and inline styles. The code also includes unit tests to guarantee the component behaves as expected and renders the correct HTML output.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this package is `index.ts`, which exports the `&lt;Text&gt;` component from `text.tsx`. Developers using this package would import the `&lt;Text&gt;` component from this entry point. The `text.spec.tsx` file contains unit tests and is not meant to be imported directly.

## Key Files
### text.tsx
This file defines the `&lt;Text&gt;` React component. It handles the rendering of a `&lt;p&gt;` tag with default styles and allows for customization through props.

### text.spec.tsx
This file contains unit tests for the `&lt;Text&gt;` component, ensuring its functionality and correct HTML output.

## Dependencies
- **react:** This dependency provides the core React functionality for creating components and managing their lifecycle.
- **@react-email/render:** This package is used in the unit tests to render the `&lt;Text&gt;` component to HTML for assertions.
- **jest:** This is a testing framework used for running the unit tests and making assertions about the component's behavior.
