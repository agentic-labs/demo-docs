title: "text.spec.tsx"
---

## High-level description
This code defines unit tests for the `&lt;Text&gt;` React component, which is part of the `@react-email/text` package. The tests ensure that the component correctly renders its children, applies styles and other props, and produces the expected HTML output.

## Symbols
### `&lt;Text&gt; component` test suite
#### Description
This test suite verifies the functionality of the `&lt;Text&gt;` component. It uses Jest and the `@react-email/render` function to render the component and assert its output.

#### Internal Logic
The test suite includes three test cases:

* **"renders children correctly"**: This test renders a `&lt;Text&gt;` component with a simple text string as children and verifies that the rendered HTML contains the expected text.
* **"passes style and other props correctly"**: This test renders a `&lt;Text&gt;` component with custom styles and a `data-testid` prop. It then asserts that the rendered HTML includes the specified styles and the data attribute.
* **"renders correctly"**: This test renders a `&lt;Text&gt;` component with some text and uses `toMatchInlineSnapshot` to verify that the rendered HTML matches the expected output, including default styles.

## Dependencies
