## High-level description
The `packages/text` directory contains the implementation of the `@react-email/text` package, which provides a React component for rendering text blocks in email templates. This package is part of the React Email library, designed to simplify the creation of responsive and customizable email templates using React components.

## What does it do?
The `@react-email/text` package offers a `&lt;Text&gt;` component that renders as a paragraph (`&lt;p&gt;`) element with pre-defined styles suitable for email clients. It allows developers to easily add text content to their email templates with consistent formatting. The component can be customized using standard HTML attributes and inline styles, providing flexibility while maintaining email client compatibility.

Key features include:
1. Rendering text as a paragraph element with default email-friendly styles
2. Customization options through props and inline styles
3. Compatibility with popular email clients (Gmail, Apple Mail, Outlook, Yahoo! Mail, HEY, Superhuman)
4. TypeScript support for improved development experience

## Entry points
The main entry point for this package is `src/index.ts`, which exports the `&lt;Text&gt;` component defined in `src/text.tsx`. Developers using this package would import the `&lt;Text&gt;` component from this entry point.

## Key Files
1. `src/text.tsx`: Defines the `&lt;Text&gt;` React component, handling the rendering of a `&lt;p&gt;` tag with default styles and allowing for customization through props.

2. `src/text.spec.tsx`: Contains unit tests for the `&lt;Text&gt;` component, ensuring its functionality and correct HTML output.

3. `package.json`: Defines the package metadata, dependencies, and scripts for building, testing, and publishing the package.

4. `tsconfig.json`: Specifies the TypeScript compiler configuration for the package, extending a base configuration for React libraries.

## Dependencies
The package has the following key dependencies:

1. `react` (peer dependency): Provides the core React functionality for creating components.
2. `@react-email/render` (dev dependency): Used in unit tests to render the `&lt;Text&gt;` component to HTML for assertions.
3. `typescript` (dev dependency): The TypeScript compiler for type-checking and transpilation.

## Configuration
The package uses the following configuration files:

1. `.eslintrc.js`: Extends the custom "react-internal" ESLint configuration, ensuring consistent code style and best practices.

2. `tsconfig.json`: Extends a base TypeScript configuration for React libraries (`tsconfig/react-library.json`) and specifies included and excluded files for compilation.

3. `package.json`: Contains various configuration options, including:
   - `name`: `@react-email/text`
   - `version`: `0.0.10`
   - `main`: `./dist/index.js` (CommonJS entry point)
   - `module`: `./dist/index.mjs` (ES module entry point)
   - `types`: `./dist/index.d.ts` (TypeScript type definitions)
   - `sideEffects`: `false` (indicates the package has no side effects)
   - `publishConfig`: Specifies the package should be published publicly
