### Package Configuration
#### Description
This `package.json` file defines the configuration for a Node.js package named "tsconfig". It specifies essential metadata and publishing settings for the package.

#### Internal Logic
The file contains the following key-value pairs:

1. `name`: Specifies the package name as "tsconfig".
2. `version`: Set to "0.0.0", indicating that this is likely a placeholder version or an initial setup.
3. `private`: Set to `true`, which means this package is not intended to be published to a public registry.
4. `license`: Specifies the MIT license for this package.
5. `publishConfig`: Contains an `access` property set to "public", which seems to contradict the `private: true` setting.

## Dependencies
This package does not declare any dependencies.

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Value | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------|:------------|
| name | string | "tsconfig" | The name of the package |
| version | string | "0.0.0" | The version of the package (placeholder) |
| private | boolean | true | Indicates the package is private |
| license | string | "MIT" | Specifies the MIT license |
| publishConfig.access | string | "public" | Sets the publish access to public |

## Notes
There appears to be a contradiction between the `private: true` setting and the `publishConfig.access: "public"` setting. Typically, a private package would not have a `publishConfig` section. This might be an oversight or a specific configuration for a monorepo setup where the package is private within the repository but could potentially be published publicly in the future.
