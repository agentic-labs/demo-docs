## High-level description
This directory houses TypeScript configuration files (`tsconfig.json`) that define compiler options and project settings for different use cases within a larger codebase. These configurations help ensure consistent code style, type checking, and optimized output for various project types.

## What does it do?
This directory acts as a central repository for TypeScript configurations. Each file within this directory provides a set of rules and options that dictate how the TypeScript compiler processes `.ts` and `.tsx` files. This ensures code quality, enforces coding standards, and tailors the compilation process for specific environments like Next.js or React libraries.

## Key Files

### `base.json`
This file serves as the foundational TypeScript configuration for the entire codebase. It establishes a baseline by enabling strict type checking, defining module resolution strategies, and setting output generation preferences. Other configuration files, like `nextjs.json` and `react-library.json`, extend this base configuration to inherit its settings and specialize them for their specific use cases.

### `nextjs.json`
This configuration file extends `base.json` and customizes it for Next.js projects. It includes settings specific to the Next.js framework, such as enabling the Next.js plugin, allowing JavaScript files, and configuring JSX support. This ensures optimal compatibility and performance for Next.js applications.

### `react-library.json`
This configuration is designed for React library projects. It extends the `base.json` configuration and includes settings tailored for building reusable React components. This includes specific JSX handling, library inclusions for DOM manipulation, and support for the Vitest testing framework. 

### `package.json`
This file defines this directory as a package named "tsconfig". However, it's marked as private, indicating it's not meant for independent distribution. This suggests it's internally used within a larger monorepo structure.
