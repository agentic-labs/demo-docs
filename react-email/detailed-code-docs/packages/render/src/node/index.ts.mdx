### Exports
#### Description
The file exports several modules and functions:

1. From "./render":
   - Likely exports the `render` function for rendering React components to HTML.

2. From "./render-async":
   - Likely exports the `renderAsync` function, which is a deprecated version of the render function.

3. From "../shared/options":
   - Exports the `Options` type, which defines configuration options for rendering.

4. From "../shared/plain-text-selectors":
   - Exports the `plainTextSelectors` array, which contains selector definitions for HTML to plain text conversion.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| "./render" | Provides the main rendering functionality |
| "./render-async" | Provides the deprecated asynchronous rendering functionality |
| "../shared/options" | Defines the configuration options for rendering |
| "../shared/plain-text-selectors" | Provides selectors for HTML to plain text conversion |

## References
This file doesn't contain any direct code references, but it re-exports functionality from other modules. The main references are:

1. The `render` function from "packages/render/src/node/render.ts"
2. The `renderAsync` function from "packages/render/src/node/render-async.ts"
3. The `Options` type from "packages/render/src/shared/options.ts"
4. The `plainTextSelectors` array from "packages/render/src/shared/plain-text-selectors.ts"

These referenced modules contain the core functionality for rendering React components to HTML or plain text, with various configuration options.
