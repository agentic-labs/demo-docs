## High-level description
The `packages/render/src/node` directory houses the core server-side rendering logic for the application. It provides functionality to render React components into HTML or plain text in both Node.js and edge runtime environments. This includes handling different stream types, supporting Suspense boundaries, and offering options for prettifying the output or converting it to plain text.

## What does it do?
This code enables rendering React components on the server, generating HTML content that can be sent to the client. It provides two main functions: `render` and `renderAsync` (deprecated), both capable of handling different rendering scenarios and options. 

The code can adapt to different environments, like traditional Node.js servers and edge runtimes, ensuring compatibility with various deployment targets. It also handles the nuances of server-side rendering, such as waiting for asynchronous operations within Suspense boundaries to complete before finalizing the output.

For developers, this means they can write React components as usual and rely on this code to generate the corresponding HTML on the server, improving SEO and initial load times.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this directory is `index.ts`. It exports the core rendering functions (`render` and `renderAsync`), configuration options (`Options`), and utility arrays like `plainTextSelectors`. Developers using this package would primarily interact with the functions and types exported from this file.

## Key Files

### render.ts
This file contains the `render` function, which is the primary method for rendering React components to HTML or plain text. It supports both `renderToReadableStream` and `renderToPipeableStream` from `react-dom/server`, allowing it to work seamlessly in both Node.js and edge environments. The function also provides options for prettifying the HTML output and converting it to plain text using the `html-to-text` library.

### render-async.ts
This file contains the `renderAsync` function, which is a deprecated asynchronous version of the `render` function. It provides similar functionality but is marked for removal in future versions.

### render-node.spec.tsx and render-async-node.spec.tsx
These files contain unit tests for the `render` and `renderAsync` functions respectively, specifically within a Node.js environment. They cover various scenarios, including rendering with Next.js 14 error stubs and handling Suspense boundaries.

### render-edge.spec.tsx and render-async-edge.spec.tsx
These files contain unit tests for the `render` and `renderAsync` functions respectively, specifically within an edge runtime environment. They ensure the rendering logic functions correctly in edge environments, including handling legacy React DOM server APIs.

## Dependencies
- **react-dom/server:** This library is crucial for server-side rendering of React components. It provides the necessary functions like `renderToReadableStream` and `renderToPipeableStream`.
- **html-to-text:** This library is used for converting HTML content to plain text. This is useful for generating plain text versions of emails or previews.
- **react-promise-suspense:** This library is used in the test files to simulate asynchronous operations within React components, allowing for testing of Suspense boundary handling.

## Configuration
The rendering functions accept an optional `Options` object, which allows for customizing the rendering process. The available options are:

- **pretty (boolean):** Determines whether to prettify the HTML output. Defaults to `false`.
- **plainText (boolean):** Determines whether to convert the output to plain text. Defaults to `false`.
- **htmlToTextOptions (HtmlToTextOptions):** Provides options for the `html-to-text` library when converting HTML to plain text.
