### `Options`
#### Description
`Options` is a TypeScript type that defines the configuration options for rendering HTML content. It uses a union type to provide different sets of options based on whether plain text conversion is enabled or not.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| pretty | boolean (optional) | Determines if the output should be pretty-printed |
| plainText | boolean (optional) | Determines if the output should be converted to plain text |
| htmlToTextOptions | HtmlToTextOptions (optional) | Options for the HTML-to-text conversion process |

#### Internal Logic
The `Options` type is defined using a combination of an object type and a union type:
1. The base object type includes the `pretty` option.
2. The union type creates two possible configurations:
   a. When `plainText` is false or undefined, no additional options are available.
   b. When `plainText` is true, the `htmlToTextOptions` become available.

This structure ensures that `htmlToTextOptions` are only relevant when `plainText` is set to true.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| html-to-text | Provides the `HtmlToTextOptions` type used in the `Options` type |

## References
The `Options` type is referenced in several other files within the project:
- `packages/render/src/browser/render.ts`
- `packages/render/src/node/render-async.ts`
- `packages/render/src/browser/render-async.ts`
- `packages/render/src/node/render.ts`

These files use the `Options` type to configure the rendering process, including plain text conversion and pretty-printing of the output.

## Notes
The `htmlToTextOptions` property includes a JSDoc comment explaining its purpose and providing a link to the library used for HTML-to-text conversion. This is helpful for developers who may need to customize the plain text conversion process.
