## High-level description
The `packages/render/src/shared/utils` directory contains utility functions and React components used across different rendering environments (browser, Node.js, edge). These utilities provide functionalities like HTML beautification, rendering specific content for email previews, and a reusable template for user greetings.

## What does it do?
This directory houses helper tools for a rendering system. It includes:

1. **HTML Beautification:** A function to format HTML strings, making the output more readable.
2. **Email Preview Content:** A component that controls what content is visible in both HTML and plain text versions of an email.
3. **Reusable Template:** A component that provides a basic structure and content for greeting users, intended for use in different parts of the application.

## Key Files

### `pretty.ts`
This file exports a utility function `pretty` that beautifies HTML strings using the `js-beautify` library. It allows for customization of formatting options and is used in the rendering process to output well-formatted HTML.

### `preview.tsx`
This file defines a React component called `Preview` used specifically for email preview functionality. It helps differentiate content that should be visible only in HTML from content that should be present in both HTML and plain text versions of an email.

### `template.tsx`
This file defines a React component called `Template` that acts as a reusable template for greeting users. It takes a user's first name as a prop and renders a welcome message with an image. This component is used in various tests to verify rendering functionality.
