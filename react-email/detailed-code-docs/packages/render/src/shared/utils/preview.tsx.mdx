## High-level description
This code defines a React functional component called `Preview` that renders two elements: a hidden div with a specific ID and a visible h1 element. It's designed to be used in email preview functionality, where certain content should be hidden in plain text versions but visible in HTML versions.

## Symbols

### `Preview`
#### Description
`Preview` is a React functional component that renders two elements: a div with the ID "__react-email-preview" and an h1 element.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props.

#### Outputs
Returns a React fragment containing two elements:
1. A div with the ID "__react-email-preview" and the text "This should be hidden from plain text"
2. An h1 element with the text "This should be rendered in plain text"

#### Internal Logic
The component uses a React fragment (`&lt;&gt;...&lt;/&gt;`) to group multiple elements without adding an extra DOM node. It renders two elements:
1. A div with a specific ID that is intended to be hidden in plain text versions of the email.
2. An h1 element that is intended to be visible in both HTML and plain text versions of the email.

## References
This component is used in several test files:
- `render-web.spec.tsx`
- `render-async-web.spec.tsx`
- `render-async-node.spec.tsx`
- `render-edge.spec.tsx`
- `render-node.spec.tsx`
- `render-async-edge.spec.tsx`

In these test files, the `Preview` component is used to test the rendering functionality, particularly the ability to convert React components to plain text while removing elements with the reserved ID.

## Dependencies
- React: The component uses React's `FC` type and JSX syntax.

## Error Handling
This component doesn't implement any specific error handling.

## Performance Considerations
As a simple stateless component, `Preview` should have minimal performance impact. It doesn't involve any complex calculations or state management.

## TODOs
There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
