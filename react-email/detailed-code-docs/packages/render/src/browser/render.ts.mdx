## High-level description
This code provides a function to render React components into HTML or plain text in a browser environment. It supports both streaming and non-streaming rendering methods, handles different React DOM server implementations, and offers options for plain text conversion and pretty printing.

## Code Structure
The main `render` function uses helper functions and imported utilities to process the React component. It dynamically imports the React DOM server module and uses different rendering methods based on the available API. The code also handles stream reading, HTML to plain text conversion, and pretty printing based on the provided options.

## References
- `html-to-text`: Used for converting HTML to plain text
- `react-dom/server`: Used for server-side rendering of React components
- `../shared/utils/pretty`: Used for pretty-printing HTML
- `../shared/plain-text-selectors`: Provides selectors for plain text conversion
- `../shared/options`: Defines the options type for the render function

## Symbols

### `readStream`
#### Description
Reads a stream (either PipeableStream or ReactDOMServerReadableStream) and returns the content as a string.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| stream | PipeableStream \| ReactDOMServerReadableStream | The stream to be read |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | string | The content of the stream as a string |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the stream has a `pipeTo` method (indicating it's a readable stream).
2. If it's a readable stream, creates a writable stream and pipes the input stream to it, decoding chunks and appending them to the result.
3. If it's not a readable stream, throws an error indicating that the Node version of `react-dom/server` was imported instead of the browser one.

### `render`
#### Description
Renders a React component to HTML or plain text, with options for pretty printing.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| component | React.ReactElement | The React component to render |
| options | Options (optional) | Rendering options |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | string | The rendered HTML or plain text |

#### Internal Logic
1. Dynamically imports `react-dom/server`.
2. Chooses between `renderToReadableStream` and `renderToPipeableStream` based on availability.
3. Reads the stream to get the HTML content.
4. If `plainText` option is true, converts HTML to plain text using `html-to-text`.
5. Adds DOCTYPE and optionally pretty prints the HTML.
6. Returns the final result.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| html-to-text | Converting HTML to plain text |
| react-dom/server | Server-side rendering of React components |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| pretty | boolean | undefined | Whether to pretty print the HTML output |
| plainText | boolean | undefined | Whether to convert the output to plain text |
| htmlToTextOptions | HtmlToTextOptions | undefined | Options for HTML to text conversion |

## Error Handling
The code includes error handling for stream reading and React DOM server rendering. It throws an error if the Node version of `react-dom/server` is imported instead of the browser version.

## Performance Considerations
The code uses streaming rendering methods when available, which can be more efficient for large components or server-side rendering scenarios.
