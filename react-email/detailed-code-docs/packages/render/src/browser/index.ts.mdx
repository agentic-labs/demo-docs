## High-level description
This file serves as the main entry point for the browser-specific rendering functionality of a React email rendering package. It exports rendering functions, options, and plain text selectors for use in browser environments.

## Code Structure
The file primarily consists of export statements, re-exporting functionality from other modules within the package.

### Export statements
#### Description
The file exports several modules and types:

1. `render` and `renderAsync` functions from the browser-specific rendering modules.
2. `Options` type from the shared options module.
3. `plainTextSelectors` from the shared plain text selectors module.

#### Internal Logic
The export statements make the following components available for use in other parts of the application or for external consumption:

1. `render`: A function for synchronous rendering of React components to HTML or plain text.
2. `renderAsync`: An asynchronous version of the render function.
3. `Options`: A type definition for configuration options used in rendering.
4. `plainTextSelectors`: An array of selector definitions used for converting HTML to plain text.

## Dependencies
The file indirectly depends on the following modules:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react-dom/server | For server-side rendering of React components |
| html-to-text | For converting HTML to plain text |

## References
This file references the following modules within the package:
1. `packages/render/src/browser/render`
2. `packages/render/src/browser/render-async`
3. `packages/render/src/shared/options`
4. `packages/render/src/shared/plain-text-selectors`

These modules contain the actual implementation of the exported functionality.
