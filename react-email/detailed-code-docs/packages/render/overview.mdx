## High-level description
The `packages/render` directory contains the core functionality for rendering React components into HTML or plain text, primarily for email content. This package is designed to work in various JavaScript environments, including browsers, Node.js, and edge runtimes. It provides a flexible and efficient rendering system with shared utilities and environment-specific implementations.

## What does it do?
This package enables developers to:
1. Transform React components into HTML email templates.
2. Render React components into HTML or plain text for email content.
3. Support different rendering environments (browser, Node.js, edge runtime).
4. Customize the rendering process with options like pretty-printing and plain text conversion.
5. Handle asynchronous rendering, including Suspense boundaries.
6. Provide utilities for HTML beautification and email preview content.

The system adapts to different React DOM server implementations and offers both synchronous and asynchronous rendering methods. It also includes functionality for converting HTML to plain text, which is useful for generating alternative versions of emails.

## Entry points
The main entry points for this package are:

1. `src/browser/index.ts`: Exports rendering functions and types for browser environments.
2. `src/node/index.ts`: Exports rendering functions and types for Node.js and edge environments.

These files export the core rendering functions (`render` and `renderAsync`), configuration options (`Options`), and utility arrays like `plainTextSelectors`.

## Key Files
1. `src/browser/render.ts` and `src/node/render.ts`: Contain the primary `render` function for browser and server environments, respectively.
2. `src/shared/options.ts`: Defines the `Options` type for rendering configuration.
3. `src/shared/utils/pretty.ts`: Exports a utility function for beautifying HTML strings.
4. `src/shared/utils/preview.tsx`: Defines a React component for email preview functionality.

## Dependencies
- react: ^18.0 || ^19.0 || ^19.0.0-rc
- react-dom: ^18.0 || ^19.0 || ^19.0.0-rc
- html-to-text: 9.0.5
- js-beautify: ^1.14.11
- react-promise-suspense: 0.3.4

## Configuration
The rendering functions accept an optional `Options` object with the following configurable fields:

- `pretty` (boolean): Determines whether to prettify the HTML output.
- `plainText` (boolean): Determines whether to convert the output to plain text.
- `htmlToTextOptions` (HtmlToTextOptions): Provides options for the `html-to-text` library when converting HTML to plain text.

Additionally, the `plainTextSelectors` array in `shared/plain-text-selectors.ts` provides configuration for HTML-to-plain-text conversion, defining how specific HTML elements should be handled during the conversion process.

This package is designed to be flexible and efficient, supporting various use cases for generating email content in both HTML and plain text formats across different JavaScript environments.
