title: "tsconfig.json"
---

## High-level description
This file is a TypeScript configuration file (`tsconfig.json`) for the `render` package. It extends a base configuration for React libraries and specifies which files to include and exclude from the TypeScript compilation process.

## Symbols

### `extends`
#### Description
This property specifies the base configuration file that this `tsconfig.json` extends. In this case, it extends `"tsconfig/react-library.json"`, which likely contains common TypeScript settings for React library projects.

### `include`
#### Description
This property defines which files should be included in the TypeScript compilation process. Here, it is set to `["."]`, which means all TypeScript files in the current directory and its subdirectories will be included.

### `exclude`
#### Description
This property specifies which files or directories should be excluded from the TypeScript compilation process. In this configuration, it excludes the following:
- `"dist"`: Typically used for output files
- `"build"`: Another common directory for build outputs
- `"node_modules"`: The directory containing third-party dependencies

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| tsconfig/react-library.json | Base TypeScript configuration for React libraries |

Note: The exact contents of the `tsconfig/react-library.json` file are not provided, but it likely contains common TypeScript settings optimized for React library development.

This configuration file is concise and straightforward, focusing on extending a base configuration and specifying include/exclude patterns for the TypeScript compiler. It's a typical setup for a React library project within a monorepo or a structured project setup.
