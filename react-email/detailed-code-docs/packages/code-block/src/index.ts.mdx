## Symbols

### Export statements
#### Description
The file contains three export statements, each importing and re-exporting all symbols from different files within the package.

1. `export * from "./code-block";`
   This statement exports all symbols from the "code-block" file, which likely contains the main CodeBlock component and related types.

2. `export * from "./themes";`
   This statement exports all symbols from the "themes" file, which probably contains various theme definitions for syntax highlighting.

3. `export * from "./languages-available";`
   This statement exports all symbols from the "languages-available" file, which defines the available programming languages for syntax highlighting.

## Dependencies
The file depends on three internal modules:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| "./code-block" | Provides the main CodeBlock component and related functionality |
| "./themes" | Contains theme definitions for syntax highlighting |
| "./languages-available" | Defines the available programming languages for syntax highlighting |

## References
This file doesn't directly reference any symbols, but it re-exports all symbols from the imported files, making them available to users of the package.
