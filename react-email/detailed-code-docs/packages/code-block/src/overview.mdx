## High-level description
This directory implements a React component for rendering syntax-highlighted code blocks. It leverages the Prism.js library for tokenization and styling, offering a variety of themes and language support.

## What does it do?
The code defines a React component that takes source code as input and renders it with syntax highlighting. It breaks down the code into individual tokens (keywords, comments, strings, etc.) and applies styles based on the selected theme and language. This makes the code more readable and visually appealing, especially for technical documentation or code examples.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this package is `index.ts`, which exports the `CodeBlock` component, available themes, and supported languages. Developers using this package would import these exports to use the code block functionality in their applications.

## Key Files

### packages/code-block/src/code-block.tsx
This file defines the main `CodeBlock` React component. It handles tokenization of the code using Prism.js based on the provided language and applies styles from the selected theme. The component recursively renders individual lines and tokens, applying appropriate styling and handling nested elements.

### packages/code-block/src/themes.ts
This file defines various syntax highlighting themes as TypeScript objects. Each theme maps Prism.js token types to CSS styles, allowing for customizable color schemes for code highlighting. The themes are exported as constants and can be used with the `CodeBlock` component to change the visual appearance of the rendered code.
