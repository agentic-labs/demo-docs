## High-level description
This file defines a TypeScript type `PrismLangauge` that represents a comprehensive list of programming languages and markup formats supported by the Prism syntax highlighting library. It serves as a type definition for language selection in code highlighting components.

## Symbols

### PrismLangauge
#### Description
`PrismLangauge` is a TypeScript type alias that defines a union of string literals, each representing a supported language or file format for syntax highlighting.

#### Inputs
This type doesn't have inputs as it's a type definition.

#### Outputs
The type itself serves as an output, providing a set of valid language options for type checking and autocompletion in TypeScript.

#### Internal Logic
The type is defined as a union of string literals, each corresponding to a language identifier used by Prism.js. It includes both primary language names (e.g., "javascript", "python") and common file extensions or aliases (e.g., "js", "py").

## Dependencies
This file doesn't explicitly import any external dependencies. However, it is closely related to the Prism.js library, as it defines the languages supported by that library.

## References
The `PrismLangauge` type is referenced in other parts of the codebase:

1. In `packages/code-block/src/code-block.tsx`, it's used as part of the `CodeBlockProps` interface:
   ```typescript
   export type CodeBlockProps = Readonly&lt;{
     // ...
     language: PrismLangauge;
     // ...
   }&gt;;
   ```
   This ensures that only valid language identifiers can be passed to the `CodeBlock` component.

2. The type is exported in `packages/code-block/src/index.ts`, making it available for use in other parts of the application or by consumers of this package.

## Performance Considerations
While the `PrismLangauge` type itself doesn't have runtime performance implications, it provides compile-time checks and autocompletion, which can improve developer productivity and reduce errors related to invalid language selection.

## Notes
1. The type includes multiple aliases for some languages (e.g., "javascript" and "js"), providing flexibility in language specification.
2. The extensive list of languages suggests that this code block component supports a wide range of programming languages and file formats, making it versatile for various use cases.
3. The spelling of "Langauge" in the type name appears to be a typo and should probably be corrected to "Language" for consistency and clarity.
