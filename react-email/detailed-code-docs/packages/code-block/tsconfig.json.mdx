title: "tsconfig.json"
---

## High-level description
This file is a TypeScript configuration file (`tsconfig.json`) for the `code-block` package. It sets up the TypeScript compiler options for a React library project, extending a base configuration and specifying which files to include and exclude from compilation.

## Symbols

### `extends`
#### Description
This property specifies the base configuration file that this `tsconfig.json` extends from. In this case, it's using a configuration file named `react-library.json` from a `tsconfig` package or directory.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| extends | string | Path to the base configuration file |

### `include`
#### Description
This property defines an array of file or directory patterns to be included in the compilation process. In this configuration, it's set to include all files in the current directory.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| include | array | Array of glob patterns for files to include |

### `exclude`
#### Description
This property defines an array of file or directory patterns to be excluded from the compilation process. It's used to prevent TypeScript from processing certain files or directories.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| exclude | array | Array of glob patterns for files to exclude |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| tsconfig/react-library.json | Base TypeScript configuration for React libraries |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| extends | string | "tsconfig/react-library.json" | Specifies the base configuration to extend |
| include | array | ["."] | Includes all files in the current directory |
| exclude | array | ["dist", "build", "node_modules"] | Excludes specified directories from compilation |

This `tsconfig.json` file is relatively simple and straightforward. It extends a pre-defined configuration for React libraries, which likely contains most of the necessary compiler options. The file then specifies to include all files in the current directory for compilation, while excluding the `dist`, `build`, and `node_modules` directories, which typically contain generated code, build artifacts, and third-party dependencies respectively.
