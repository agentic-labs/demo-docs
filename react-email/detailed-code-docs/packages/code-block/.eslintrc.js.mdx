## High-level description
This code configures ESLint for a React-based internal package named "code-block". It extends a custom ESLint configuration specifically designed for internal React libraries.

## Code Structure
The file exports a single configuration object that extends the "custom/react-internal" ESLint configuration.

## Symbols

### module.exports
#### Description
This is the main export of the ESLint configuration file. It defines the ESLint rules and settings for the "code-block" package.

#### Inputs
N/A

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| extends | Array | An array containing the ESLint configuration to extend |

#### Internal Logic
The configuration extends a single custom ESLint configuration: "custom/react-internal". This custom configuration is likely defined in a separate file and contains specific rules and settings for internal React libraries.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| custom/react-internal | Custom ESLint configuration for internal React libraries |

## References
The "custom/react-internal" configuration is referenced in this file. Based on the related code snippet provided, this configuration is likely defined in the file "packages/eslint-config-custom/react-internal.js".

## Additional Context
From the related code snippet, we can infer that the "custom/react-internal" configuration:

1. Extends multiple configurations from the Vercel Engineering Style Guide.
2. Sets up parser options for TypeScript.
3. Configures the environment for Node.js.
4. Sets up import resolution for TypeScript.
5. Ignores certain directories and files.
6. Overrides some ESLint rules, particularly for React and TypeScript.

This configuration provides a comprehensive set of linting rules tailored for internal React libraries, ensuring code consistency and quality across the project.
