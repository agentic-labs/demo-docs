title: "tsconfig.json"
---

## High-level description
This file, `tsconfig.json`, is a configuration file for TypeScript in the `hr` package. It defines how TypeScript should compile the code in this directory by inheriting settings from a shared configuration file and specifying what files to include and exclude.

## Symbols
### `tsconfig.json`
#### Description
This file configures the TypeScript compiler for the `hr` package. It extends a base configuration for React libraries and customizes the include and exclude paths for this specific package.

#### Inputs
This file does not take any inputs. It is read by the TypeScript compiler.

#### Outputs
This file does not produce any direct outputs. It influences the behavior of the TypeScript compiler.

#### Internal Logic
* **`"extends": "tsconfig/react-library.json"`**: This line indicates that this configuration inherits settings from a file located at `tsconfig/react-library.json`. This likely contains common settings for React projects that use TypeScript.
* **`"include": ["."]`**: This line specifies that the TypeScript compiler should include all files within the current directory (`.`) and its subdirectories.
* **`"exclude": ["dist", "build", "node_modules"]`**: This line excludes the specified directories (`dist`, `build`, `node_modules`) from being processed by the TypeScript compiler. These directories likely contain build artifacts, generated files, or external dependencies that shouldn't be compiled. 

## Dependencies
This configuration file depends on a shared TypeScript configuration file located at `tsconfig/react-library.json`. This dependency suggests a centralized way of managing common TypeScript settings across multiple packages or projects.
