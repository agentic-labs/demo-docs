## High-level description
This code defines the ESLint configuration for the `hr` package, extending a custom React configuration for internal libraries. It sets up linting rules and parser options based on the Vercel Engineering Style Guide.

## References
- `custom/react-internal`: This refers to a custom ESLint configuration defined in the `eslint-config-custom` package, specifically the `react-internal.js` file. This configuration likely contains rules tailored for React projects within the organization.

## Symbols
### `module.exports`
#### Description
This symbol defines the ESLint configuration object that is exported from this file. It extends the `custom/react-internal` configuration, inheriting its rules and settings.

#### Internal Logic
The configuration object has a single property:

- `extends`: This property specifies that the current configuration should extend the `custom/react-internal` configuration. This means that all rules and settings defined in the `custom/react-internal` configuration will be inherited by the `hr` package's ESLint configuration.

## Dependencies
This configuration file implicitly depends on the following ESLint configurations:

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `custom/react-internal` | Provides a base set of ESLint rules and settings specifically designed for internal React libraries. |
| `@vercel/style-guide/eslint/browser` | Enforces the Vercel Engineering Style Guide for browser-based JavaScript code. |
| `@vercel/style-guide/eslint/typescript` | Enforces the Vercel Engineering Style Guide for TypeScript code. |
| `@vercel/style-guide/eslint/react` | Enforces the Vercel Engineering Style Guide for React code. |
| `eslint-config-prettier` | Disables ESLint rules that conflict with Prettier formatting rules. |
