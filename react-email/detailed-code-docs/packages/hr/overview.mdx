## High-level description
The `packages/hr` directory contains the implementation of a React component for rendering horizontal rules (`&lt;hr&gt;`) in email templates. This package is part of the React Email library, providing a simple yet customizable way to add dividers to email content.

## What does it do?
This package offers a single React component called `Hr` that generates a horizontal line for use in email templates. It provides default styling suitable for emails while allowing customization through props. The component is designed to be compatible with various email clients, ensuring consistent rendering across different platforms.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this package is the `index.ts` file in the `src` directory. It exports the `Hr` component, making it accessible for use in email templates built with React Email.

## Key Files
1. `src/hr.tsx`: Contains the implementation of the `Hr` component, defining its structure, default styles, and prop handling.
2. `src/hr.spec.tsx`: Houses unit tests for the `Hr` component, ensuring its functionality and correct rendering.
3. `package.json`: Defines the package metadata, dependencies, and build scripts.
4. `tsconfig.json`: Configures TypeScript compilation settings for the package.

## Dependencies
The package has the following key dependencies:
- `react`: Core React library (peer dependency)
- `@react-email/render`: Used for rendering components in tests

Development dependencies include TypeScript, ESLint, and other tools for building and testing the component.

## Configuration
The package uses the following configuration files:
- `.eslintrc.js`: Extends the custom React ESLint configuration for internal libraries.
- `tsconfig.json`: Extends a shared TypeScript configuration for React libraries.

The `package.json` file configures the build process, specifying output formats (CommonJS, ES modules, and TypeScript definitions) and setting up scripts for building, testing, and linting.

## Code Snippet
Here's a basic example of how to use the `Hr` component:

```jsx
import { Hr } from "@react-email/hr";

const Email = () =&gt; {
  return (
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Content above the line&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;Hr /&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Content below the line&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
};
```

The `Hr` component can be customized with props to adjust its appearance, such as color, width, and alignment, making it flexible for various email design needs.
