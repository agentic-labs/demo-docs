title: "index.ts"

## High-level description
This file exports the `hr` module, which provides a React component for rendering a horizontal rule (`&lt;hr&gt;`) element with default styling.

## References
- `./hr`: This refers to the `hr.tsx` file, which likely contains the implementation of the `hr` module being exported.

## Symbols
### Symbol Name
`export * from "./hr";`

#### Description
This statement exports all named exports from the `./hr` module, making them available for use in other parts of the application.

#### Internal Logic
This is a standard JavaScript module export statement. It takes all exported symbols (functions, classes, variables, etc.) from the specified module (`./hr`) and re-exports them from the current module (`index.ts`). This allows for a cleaner and more organized API by aggregating exports from multiple files into a single entry point.
