## High-level description
The `packages/hr/src` directory houses the implementation of a React component designed specifically for rendering horizontal rules (`&lt;hr&gt;`) within email templates. This component, named `Hr`, provides a streamlined way to include styled horizontal rules while ensuring compatibility with email clients.

## What does it do?
This directory provides a single React component, `Hr`, that simplifies the process of adding a styled horizontal line to an email template. It offers default styling suitable for emails while allowing customization through props.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this component is `index.ts`. It exports the `Hr` component from `hr.tsx`, making it accessible to other parts of the application. The `hr.spec.tsx` file contains unit tests for the `Hr` component, ensuring its functionality and stability.

## Key Files
- **`hr.tsx`**: This file contains the implementation of the `Hr` component. It defines the component's structure, styles, and how it handles props.
- **`hr.spec.tsx`**: This file houses the unit tests for the `Hr` component. These tests ensure that the component renders correctly with default and custom styles and that it behaves as expected under different conditions.

## Dependencies
- **`react`**: This dependency provides the core React functionality, including `React.forwardRef` for accessing the underlying DOM element and JSX support.
- **`@react-email/render`**: This dependency is used specifically within the test file (`hr.spec.tsx`) to render the `Hr` component into an HTML string for testing purposes.
