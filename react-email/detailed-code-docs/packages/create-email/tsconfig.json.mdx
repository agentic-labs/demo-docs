## High-level description

This file is a TypeScript configuration file (`tsconfig.json`) for the `create-email` package. It extends a base configuration for React libraries and specifies which files to include and exclude from the TypeScript compilation process.

## Symbols

### `tsconfig.json`

#### Description

This JSON configuration file defines the TypeScript compiler options for the `create-email` package. It uses a base configuration and customizes the include and exclude paths.

#### Internal Logic

1. The configuration extends a base configuration file named `react-library.json` from the `tsconfig` package.
2. It includes all files in the current directory and its subdirectories for compilation.
3. It excludes specific directories from the compilation process.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| tsconfig | Provides the base configuration (`react-library.json`) for React libraries |

### Configuration

| Option | Type | Value | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------|:------------|
| extends | string | "tsconfig/react-library.json" | Specifies the base configuration file to extend |
| include | array | ["."] | Defines which files to include in the compilation process |
| exclude | array | ["dist", "build", "node_modules"] | Specifies directories to exclude from compilation |

## Notes

1. The configuration extends `tsconfig/react-library.json`, which likely contains pre-defined settings optimized for React library development.
2. The `include` option is set to `["."]`, which means it will include all TypeScript files in the current directory and its subdirectories.
3. The `exclude` option lists directories that should be ignored during compilation:
   - `dist`: Typically used for compiled output
   - `build`: Another common directory for build artifacts
   - `node_modules`: Contains third-party dependencies
4. This configuration ensures that only the relevant source files are compiled, excluding any build outputs or external dependencies.
