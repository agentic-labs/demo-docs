## High-level description
The `packages/create-email` directory contains the source code and configuration for a command-line tool called "create-email". This tool is designed to help users quickly set up a new React Email project by providing a pre-configured template and necessary dependencies.

## What does it do?
The `create-email` tool simplifies the process of starting a new React Email project. When a user runs the command, it performs the following actions:

1. Creates a new directory (either with a default name or a user-specified name).
2. Copies a pre-configured template into the new directory, which includes:
   - Sample email templates (e.g., welcome emails, verification codes, invitations)
   - A development environment for previewing and testing email templates in the browser
   - Scripts for building and exporting email templates
   - Configuration files for dependencies and project metadata
3. Updates the `package.json` file to remove any unnecessary workspace prefixes from dependencies.
4. Displays a success message along with a visual representation of the newly created project's directory structure.

## Entry points
The main entry point for the tool is `src/index.js`. This file uses the `commander` library to handle command-line arguments and execute the appropriate actions. The `tree.js` file in the `src` directory provides a utility function for generating a visual tree representation of the created project's directory structure.

## Key Files
1. `src/index.js`: The main script that handles the command-line interface and project creation process.
2. `src/tree.js`: Utility function for generating a tree-like representation of a directory structure.
3. `template/`: Directory containing the pre-configured React Email project template, including:
   - `emails/`: Sample email template components (e.g., `notion-magic-link.tsx`, `stripe-welcome.tsx`)
   - `package.json`: Project configuration and dependencies
   - `readme.md`: Instructions for setting up and running the project

## Dependencies
The project relies on several external libraries:

- `commander` (v9.4.1): For creating the command-line interface
- `fs-extra` (v11.1.1): Provides enhanced file system operations
- `log-symbols` (v5.1.0): For logging with symbols in the console
- `ora` (v6.1.2): Creates elegant terminal spinners for visual feedback

The template project also includes dependencies for React Email development:

- `@react-email/components` (v0.0.23): Pre-built components for creating email templates
- `react-email` (v3.0.1): Core library for creating React-based email templates
- `react` (v18.3.1) and `react-dom` (v18.3.1): Core React libraries

## Configuration
The tool uses the following configuration:

1. Version: The current version is 0.0.32, as specified in the `package.json` file.
2. Node.js requirement: The package requires Node.js version 18.0.0 or higher.
3. Template configuration:
   - `VERCEL_URL` environment variable: Used to determine the base URL for assets in email templates.
   - npm scripts: `build`, `dev`, and `export` for various development and production tasks.

The `create-email` tool provides an easy-to-use solution for developers to quickly set up and start working on React Email projects, streamlining the initial setup process and providing a solid foundation for email template development.
