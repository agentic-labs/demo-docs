## High-level description
This code defines a `tree` function that generates a tree-like representation of a directory structure. It's designed to visualize the hierarchy of files and folders up to a specified depth, using ASCII characters to represent the structure.

## Code Structure
The main functionality is split into two functions: `getTreeLines` (an async recursive function that builds the tree structure) and `tree` (the exported function that calls `getTreeLines` and formats the output).

## Symbols

### `SYMBOLS`
#### Description
An object containing ASCII characters used to represent different parts of the tree structure.

| Symbol | Description |
|:-------|:------------|
| BRANCH | Represents a branch in the tree |
| EMPTY | An empty string |
| INDENT | Used for indentation |
| LAST_BRANCH | Represents the last branch in a set of siblings |
| VERTICAL | Represents a vertical line in the tree |

### `getTreeLines`
#### Description
An asynchronous recursive function that generates an array of strings representing the tree structure of a directory.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| dirPath | string | The path of the directory to process |
| depth | number | The maximum depth to traverse |
| currentDepth | number | The current depth in the recursion (default: 0) |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| lines | string[] | An array of strings representing the tree structure |

#### Internal Logic
1. Resolve the full path of the directory
2. Get the directory name and create the first line of the output
3. If the current depth is less than the maximum depth and the path is a directory:
   a. Read the directory contents
   b. Sort the contents (directories first, then alphabetically)
   c. For each item in the directory:
      - If it's a file, add it to the output with the appropriate branching symbol
      - If it's a directory, recursively call `getTreeLines` and add the results to the output
4. Return the array of lines

### `tree`
#### Description
The main exported function that generates a string representation of the directory tree.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| dirPath | string | The path of the directory to process |
| depth | number | The maximum depth to traverse |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| treeString | string | A string representation of the directory tree |

#### Internal Logic
1. Call `getTreeLines` with the provided `dirPath` and `depth`
2. Join the resulting array of lines using the operating system's end-of-line character

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| node:fs | For file system operations (using promises API) |
| node:os | To get the operating system's end-of-line character |
| node:path | For path manipulations |

## Performance Considerations
The function uses asynchronous file system operations, which can be beneficial for performance when dealing with large directory structures. However, for very deep or wide directory trees, the recursive nature of the algorithm might lead to high memory usage or stack overflow errors.
