## High-level description
This directory contains the source code for a command-line tool called "create-email". This tool simplifies the process of starting a new React Email project by copying a pre-configured template directory and setting up the necessary files and dependencies.

## What does it do?
The `create-email` tool allows users to quickly bootstrap a new React Email project without manually creating files and configuring dependencies. When a user runs the `create-email` command in their terminal, the tool copies a template directory containing a basic React Email project structure to the specified location. It then updates the `package.json` file to remove any unnecessary workspace prefixes from dependencies. Finally, the tool displays a success message along with a visual representation of the newly created project's directory structure.

## Entry points
The main entry point for the code is `index.js`. This file utilizes the `commander` library to handle command-line arguments and execute the appropriate actions. The `tree.js` file provides a utility function for generating a visual tree representation of a directory structure, which is used to display the created project's structure to the user.

## Key Files
### `tree.js`
This file contains the logic for generating a tree-like representation of a directory structure. It defines a function called `tree` that takes a directory path and an optional depth parameter as input. The function recursively traverses the directory structure up to the specified depth and constructs a string representation of the directory tree using ASCII characters. This visual representation is then used by `index.js` to display the structure of the newly created project to the user.

## Dependencies
- **commander:** Used for parsing command-line arguments and defining commands.
- **fs-extra:** Provides enhanced file system operations, including copying directories and files.
- **log-symbols:** Offers a set of symbols for logging messages, such as success and error symbols.
- **ora:** Used for creating and managing terminal spinners to indicate progress.

## Configuration
The `index.js` file defines a default version number for the `create-email` tool. This version number is displayed in the console output when the tool is executed.
```javascript
Command.version("0.0.30-canary.0")
```
