## High-level description
This directory contains React components that define email templates for various purposes. Each template is implemented as a separate component, using the `@react-email/components` library for structuring the email content.

## What does it do?
This directory provides pre-built email templates that can be used to send different types of emails, such as welcome messages, verification codes, and invitations. Each template component defines the layout and content of the email, including text, images, buttons, and links. These components can be rendered server-side to generate HTML email content that can be sent using an email sending service.

## Key Files

### `notion-magic-link.tsx`
This file defines the `NotionMagicLinkEmail` component, which renders an email template for Notion's magic link login. It includes a login link, a temporary login code, and information about Notion.

### `plaid-verify-identity.tsx`
This file defines the `PlaidVerifyIdentityEmail` component, which renders an email template for Plaid's identity verification process. It includes a validation code, Plaid branding, and contact information.

### `stripe-welcome.tsx`
This file defines the `StripeWelcomeEmail` component, which renders a welcome email template for Stripe users. It includes a logo, welcome message, instructions, and links to Stripe resources.

### `vercel-invite-user.tsx`
This file defines the `VercelInviteUserEmail` component, which renders an email template for inviting users to Vercel. It includes user and team information, an invitation link, and details about the invitation sender.

## Dependencies
All email template components in this directory depend on the following libraries:

- `@react-email/components`: Provides pre-built components for creating email templates.
- `react`: The core React library for building components.

## Configuration
The email template components use the `VERCEL_URL` environment variable to determine the base URL for assets, such as images and logos. If this variable is not set, the base URL defaults to an empty string.
