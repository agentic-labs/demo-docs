## High-level description
This directory contains a template for creating React Email projects. It includes pre-built email templates, configuration files, and a basic project structure for developing and building email templates using React and the React Email library.

## What does it do?
The template provides a starting point for developers to create and customize email templates using React components. It includes:

1. Pre-built email templates for common scenarios (e.g., welcome emails, verification codes, invitations).
2. A development environment for previewing and testing email templates in the browser.
3. Scripts for building and exporting email templates for production use.
4. Configuration for dependencies and project metadata.

Developers can use this template to quickly set up a React Email project, customize existing templates, or create new ones using the provided components and structure.

## Key Files

### `emails/` directory
Contains pre-built email template components:

- `notion-magic-link.tsx`: Email template for Notion's magic link login.
- `plaid-verify-identity.tsx`: Email template for Plaid's identity verification process.
- `stripe-welcome.tsx`: Welcome email template for Stripe users.
- `vercel-invite-user.tsx`: Email template for inviting users to Vercel.

These templates demonstrate how to structure email content using React components and the `@react-email/components` library.

### `package.json`
Defines the project configuration, including:

- Project name and version
- Scripts for development, building, and exporting
- Dependencies and their versions

```json
{
  "name": "react-email-starter",
  "version": "0.0.32",
  "private": true,
  "scripts": {
    "build": "email build",
    "dev": "email dev",
    "export": "email export"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@react-email/components": "0.0.23",
    "react-email": "3.0.1",
    "react-dom": "18.3.1",
    "react": "18.3.1"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@types/react": "18.3.4",
    "@types/react-dom": "18.3.0"
  }
}
```

### `readme.md`
Provides instructions for setting up and running the project:

```markdown
# React Email Starter

A live preview right in your browser so you don't need to keep sending real emails during development.

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```sh
npm install
# or
yarn
```

Then, run the development server:

```sh
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Dependencies
The project relies on the following key dependencies:

1. `@react-email/components` (v0.0.23): Provides pre-built components for creating email templates.
2. `react-email` (v3.0.1): Core library for creating React-based email templates.
3. `react` (v18.3.1) and `react-dom` (v18.3.1): Core React libraries for building components and interacting with the DOM.

Development dependencies include TypeScript type definitions for React and React DOM.

## Configuration
The project uses the following configuration:

1. `VERCEL_URL` environment variable: Used to determine the base URL for assets in email templates. If not set, it defaults to an empty string.

2. npm scripts:
   - `build`: Runs the email build process
   - `dev`: Starts the development server
   - `export`: Exports the email templates

3. The project is marked as private, indicating it's not intended for publication to npm.

This template provides a solid foundation for developers to start creating and customizing email templates using React and the React Email library, with a focus on ease of use and rapid development.
