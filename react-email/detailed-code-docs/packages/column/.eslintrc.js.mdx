## High-level description
This code configures ESLint for a React-based internal package named "column". It extends a custom ESLint configuration specifically designed for internal React libraries.

## Code Structure
The file exports a single configuration object that extends the "custom/react-internal" ESLint configuration.

## Symbols

### module.exports
#### Description
This is the main export of the ESLint configuration file. It defines the ESLint rules and settings for the "column" package.

#### Internal Logic
The configuration extends the "custom/react-internal" ESLint preset, which is likely defined in a separate file within the project's ESLint configuration setup.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| custom/react-internal | Provides the base ESLint configuration for internal React libraries |

## References
The "custom/react-internal" configuration is referenced and extended in this file. Based on the related code snippet provided, this configuration is likely defined in the file `packages/eslint-config-custom/react-internal.js`.

## Additional Context
From the related code snippet, we can infer that the "custom/react-internal" configuration:

1. Extends multiple ESLint configurations from the Vercel Engineering Style Guide.
2. Sets up parser options for TypeScript.
3. Configures the environment for Node.js.
4. Sets up import resolution for TypeScript projects.
5. Ignores certain directories and files.
6. Overrides some ESLint rules to customize the linting behavior for React and TypeScript projects.

This configuration provides a comprehensive set of linting rules tailored for internal React libraries, ensuring code consistency and quality across the project.
