## High-level description
The `packages/column` directory contains the source code and configuration files for the `@react-email/column` package. This package provides a React component called `Column` that is designed to be used in email templates for creating structured, table-based layouts. The package is part of a larger React Email project and is set up for development, testing, and distribution.

## What does it do?
The `Column` component allows developers to create vertical separations of content areas in email templates. It renders as a table cell (`&lt;td&gt;`) element and can be customized with various props, including styles and standard HTML attributes. This component is typically used in conjunction with a `Row` component to create complex, responsive email layouts that work across different email clients.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this package is the `index.ts` file in the `src` directory. It exports the `Column` component and its corresponding `ColumnProps` type definition. Developers would import the `Column` component from this package to use it in their email templates.

## Key Files
1. `src/column.tsx`: Defines the `Column` component using React's `forwardRef` for advanced ref handling.
2. `src/column.spec.tsx`: Contains unit tests for the `Column` component, ensuring proper rendering and prop handling.
3. `package.json`: Configures the package, including metadata, scripts, and dependencies.
4. `tsconfig.json`: Specifies TypeScript compiler options for the package.
5. `.eslintrc.js`: Configures ESLint for maintaining code quality.

## Dependencies
The package has the following key dependencies:
- `react` (peer dependency): The core React library.
- `@react-email/render` (dev dependency): Used for rendering React Email components during development and testing.
- `typescript`: For TypeScript support.
- `eslint-config-custom`: Custom ESLint configuration for the project.

## Configuration
The package uses several configuration files:
1. `tsconfig.json`: Extends a base React library configuration and specifies include/exclude paths for TypeScript compilation.
2. `.eslintrc.js`: Extends a custom React internal ESLint configuration.
3. `package.json`: Configures npm scripts, peer dependencies, and publishing settings.

Key configuration points include:
- The package requires Node.js version 18.0.0 or higher.
- It's set up for both ESM and CommonJS module systems.
- The package is published with public access.

The `Column` component has been tested and is compatible with major email clients, including Gmail, Apple Mail, Outlook, Yahoo! Mail, HEY, and Superhuman.
