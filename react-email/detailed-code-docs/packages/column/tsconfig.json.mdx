## High-level description

This file is a TypeScript configuration file (`tsconfig.json`) for the "column" package. It extends a base configuration for React libraries and specifies which files to include and exclude from the TypeScript compilation process.

## Symbols

### tsconfig.json
#### Description
This JSON configuration file defines the TypeScript compiler options and project settings for the "column" package. It uses a base configuration and customizes the include and exclude paths.

#### Internal Logic
1. The configuration extends a base configuration file named "react-library.json" from the "tsconfig" package.
2. It includes all files in the current directory and its subdirectories.
3. It excludes the "dist", "build", and "node_modules" directories from compilation.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| tsconfig/react-library.json | Base TypeScript configuration for React libraries |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| extends | string | "tsconfig/react-library.json" | Specifies the base configuration file to extend |
| include | array | ["."] | Defines which files to include in the compilation |
| exclude | array | ["dist", "build", "node_modules"] | Specifies directories to exclude from compilation |

Note: The actual compiler options are not visible in this file as they are inherited from the base configuration. The visible settings are focused on file inclusion and exclusion.
