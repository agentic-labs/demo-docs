## High-level description
This code exports all symbols from the "./column" module, making them available for use in other parts of the application. It serves as an entry point for the Column component and its related types.

## Symbols

### `export * from "./column"`
#### Description
This statement re-exports all named exports from the "./column" module. It allows users of this module to import the Column component and its related types directly from this file, rather than having to import from the specific "./column" file.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| "./column" | Source module for the Column component and related types |

## References
The code in this file references and re-exports the following symbols from the "./column" module:

1. `Column`: A React component that renders a table cell (`&lt;td&gt;`) element.
2. `ColumnProps`: A type definition for the props of the Column component.

These symbols are defined in the related "packages/column/src/column.tsx" file.

Note: While not directly visible in the target file, understanding the contents of the "./column" module is crucial for comprehending what this index file is exporting. The Column component is a forwarded ref component that renders a table cell with some additional attributes and styling options.
