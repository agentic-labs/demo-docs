## High-level description
This code is an index file that re-exports all the contents from the "section" module. It serves as a central point of access for the Section component and its related types, allowing users to import them from the package's root.

## Symbols

### `export * from "./section"`
#### Description
This is a re-export statement that exports all named exports from the "./section" module. It makes the contents of the "section" module available to consumers of this package without them needing to know the internal file structure.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
All named exports from the "./section" module, which include:
- `SectionProps`: A type representing the props for the Section component
- `Section`: The Section component itself

## References
This file references the "./section" module, which contains the actual implementation of the Section component and its related types.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| "./section" | Contains the implementation of the Section component and its types |

## Additional Notes
Based on the related code snippet provided, we can infer that this index file is re-exporting:

1. The `SectionProps` type, which extends React's `ComponentPropsWithoutRef&lt;"table"&gt;`.
2. The `Section` component, which is a React forwardRef component that renders a table element with specific attributes and styling.

By using this index file, consumers of the package can import the Section component and its props type like this:

```typescript
import { Section, SectionProps } from 'package-name';
```

This approach simplifies imports and provides a cleaner API for the package users.
