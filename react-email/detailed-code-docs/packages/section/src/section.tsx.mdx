## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `Section` that renders a table element with specific attributes and styling. It's designed to be a reusable component for creating sections in an email template or similar structured layout.

## Symbols

### `SectionProps`
#### Description
A type alias that represents the props for the `Section` component. It extends the default props of a `table` element, excluding the `ref` prop.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| - | React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef&lt;"table"&gt; | All props of a table element, excluding the ref prop |

### `Section`
#### Description
A React component that renders a table element with predefined attributes and styling. It uses React's `forwardRef` to allow passing a ref to the underlying table element.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| children | React.ReactNode | The content to be rendered inside the table cell |
| style | React.CSSProperties | Optional custom styles for the table |
| ...props | SectionProps | Any additional props to be spread onto the table element |

#### Outputs
Returns a React element representing a table with the specified props and children.

#### Internal Logic
1. The component renders a `table` element with the following attributes:
   - `align="center"`
   - `width="100%"`
   - `border={0}`
   - `cellPadding="0"`
   - `cellSpacing="0"`
   - `role="presentation"`
2. It spreads any additional props passed to the component onto the table element.
3. The `ref` is forwarded to the table element.
4. The `style` prop is applied to the table.
5. Inside the table, it creates a `tbody` with a single `tr` and `td`.
6. The `children` prop is rendered inside the `td` element.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| React | Used for creating the functional component and utilizing React's forwardRef |

## References
The `Section` component is exported from this file and then re-exported in the `index.ts` file, making it available for use in other parts of the application.

## Notes
- The `Section` component is given a `displayName` of "Section", which can be useful for debugging purposes.
- The component is designed to be flexible, allowing additional props to be passed through to the underlying table element.
- The use of `role="presentation"` indicates that this table is being used for layout purposes rather than data presentation.
