## High-level description
This code defines an ESLint configuration for a React-based internal package. It extends a custom ESLint configuration specifically designed for React internal projects, ensuring consistent code style and best practices across the codebase.

## Code Structure
The code exports a single object that extends the "custom/react-internal" ESLint configuration.

## Symbols

### module.exports
#### Description
This is the main export of the ESLint configuration file. It defines the ESLint rules and settings for the package.

#### Internal Logic
The configuration extends the "custom/react-internal" ESLint preset, which is likely defined in a separate file within the project's ESLint configuration setup.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| custom/react-internal | Provides the base ESLint configuration for React internal projects |

## References
The "custom/react-internal" configuration is referenced, which is likely defined in the `packages/eslint-config-custom/react-internal.js` file provided in the related code snippets.

## Additional Context
Based on the related code snippet (`packages/eslint-config-custom/react-internal.js`), we can infer that the "custom/react-internal" configuration:

1. Extends multiple ESLint configurations from the Vercel Engineering Style Guide.
2. Sets up TypeScript support with project-specific settings.
3. Configures the environment for both browser and Node.js.
4. Sets up import resolution for TypeScript files.
5. Ignores certain directories and files.
6. Overrides some default rules to customize the linting behavior for React and TypeScript projects.

This configuration ensures that the package follows best practices for React development, TypeScript usage, and overall code quality, while also adhering to the Vercel Engineering Style Guide.
