title: "tsconfig.json"
---

## High-level description
This file is a `tsconfig.json` file that configures the TypeScript compiler for the `link` package. It extends a base configuration for React libraries and specifies the source files to include and exclude during compilation.

## Symbols
### `tsconfig.json`
#### Description
This file defines the TypeScript compiler configuration for the `link` package. It inherits settings from a shared configuration file (`tsconfig/react-library.json`) and overrides some options.

#### Inputs
This file does not take any inputs. It is read by the TypeScript compiler.

#### Outputs
This file does not produce any direct outputs. It influences the behavior of the TypeScript compiler.

#### Internal Logic
* **`extends`**: This property specifies that the configuration should inherit settings from the `tsconfig/react-library.json` file. This promotes consistency and avoids code duplication.
* **`include`**: This property specifies the files and directories to include in the compilation process. In this case, it includes all files in the current directory (".").
* **`exclude`**: This property specifies the files and directories to exclude from the compilation process. It excludes the `dist`, `build`, and `node_modules` directories, which typically contain build artifacts, generated files, and external dependencies.

## Dependencies
This configuration file implicitly depends on the TypeScript compiler and the configuration defined in the `tsconfig/react-library.json` file.
