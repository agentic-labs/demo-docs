## High-level description
The `packages/link/src` directory houses the implementation of a custom `&lt;Link&gt;` component for the application. This component extends the functionality of a standard anchor tag (`&lt;a&gt;`) by providing default styling and behavior, such as opening links in a new tab and applying a specific link color.

## What does it do?
This code defines a reusable `&lt;Link&gt;` component that simplifies the process of creating links within the application. It ensures a consistent look and feel for all links by applying default styles, and it improves the user experience by opening links in a new tab by default. This prevents users from accidentally navigating away from the current page.

## Entry points
The primary entry point for this directory is `link.tsx`, which defines the `&lt;Link&gt;` component itself. Developers can import this component directly into their applications to use the custom link functionality. The `index.ts` file simply re-exports the `&lt;Link&gt;` component from `link.tsx`, making it easier to import and use in other parts of the codebase.

## Key Files
- **`link.tsx`**: This file contains the implementation of the `&lt;Link&gt;` React component. It handles prop forwarding, applies default styles, and manages the opening of links in new tabs.
- **`link.spec.tsx`**: This file contains a suite of unit tests written using Jest to ensure the correctness of the `&lt;Link&gt;` component. The tests cover aspects such as rendering behavior, prop passing, and default functionality.

## Dependencies
```
@react-email/render
jest
```

- **`@react-email/render`**: This library is used to render the `&lt;Link&gt;` component to HTML within the test environment.
- **`jest`**: This is a popular JavaScript testing framework used to write and run the unit tests for the `&lt;Link&gt;` component.
