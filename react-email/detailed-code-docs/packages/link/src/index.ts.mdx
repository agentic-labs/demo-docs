## High-level description
This file exports the `Link` component from the `./link.tsx` file. This suggests that the `Link` component is the primary export of the `link` package.

## References
- `./link.tsx`: This file defines the `Link` component that is being exported.

## Symbols
### `*`

This symbol is used to re-export the `Link` component from the `./link.tsx` file. This makes the `Link` component available for use in other parts of the application.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is an export statement, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is an export statement, not a function.

#### Internal Logic
This statement imports all exported symbols from `./link.tsx` and then re-exports them from the current file. This allows users to import the `Link` component directly from the `link` package, rather than having to import it from a specific file within the package.
