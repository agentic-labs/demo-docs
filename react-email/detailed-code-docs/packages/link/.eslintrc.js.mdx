## High-level description
This configuration file extends the ESLint rules from `custom/react-internal` for linting code within the `packages/link` directory. This setup enforces coding style and best practices specific to React projects within the internal development environment. 

## References
- `custom/react-internal`: This reference points to a shared ESLint configuration file likely located at `packages/eslint-config-custom/react-internal.js`, which defines the base ruleset for internal React projects.

## Symbols
### `module.exports`
#### Description
This symbol defines the ESLint configuration for the current directory by exporting a configuration object. It extends the `custom/react-internal` configuration, inheriting its rules and settings.

#### Internal Logic
The code defines an object with a single property, `extends`, which is set to an array containing a single string: `"custom/react-internal"`. This instructs ESLint to use the rules and settings defined in the `custom/react-internal` configuration as a base and apply them to the code in this directory.
