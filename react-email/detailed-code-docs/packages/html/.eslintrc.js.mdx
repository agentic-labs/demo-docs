## High-level description
This code configures ESLint for a React-based project within the "html" package. It extends a custom ESLint configuration specifically designed for internal React libraries.

## Code Structure
The file exports a single configuration object that extends the "custom/react-internal" ESLint configuration.

## Symbols

### module.exports
#### Description
This is the main export of the ESLint configuration file. It defines the ESLint rules and settings for the "html" package.

#### Inputs
N/A

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| extends | Array | An array containing the ESLint configuration to extend |

#### Internal Logic
The configuration extends a single custom ESLint configuration named "custom/react-internal". This likely refers to a shared configuration defined elsewhere in the project, specifically tailored for internal React libraries.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| custom/react-internal | Custom ESLint configuration for internal React libraries |

## References
The "custom/react-internal" configuration is likely defined in the `packages/eslint-config-custom/react-internal.js` file, which is provided in the related code snippets.

## Additional Context
Based on the related `react-internal.js` file, we can infer that the "custom/react-internal" configuration:

1. Extends multiple configurations from the Vercel Engineering Style Guide.
2. Sets up parser options for TypeScript.
3. Configures the environment for both browser and Node.js.
4. Sets up import resolution for TypeScript.
5. Ignores certain directories and files.
6. Overrides some ESLint rules specific to React and TypeScript development.

This configuration provides a comprehensive set of linting rules for React and TypeScript projects, with some customizations for the specific needs of internal libraries.
