## High-level description

This file is a TypeScript configuration file (`tsconfig.json`) for the HTML package in a React library project. It extends a base configuration and specifies which files to include and exclude from the TypeScript compilation process.

## Symbols

### tsconfig.json
#### Description
This JSON configuration file defines the TypeScript compiler options and project settings for the HTML package. It uses a base configuration and customizes the include and exclude paths.

#### Internal Logic
1. Extends a base configuration file for React libraries.
2. Includes all files in the current directory.
3. Excludes specific directories from compilation.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| tsconfig/react-library.json | Base TypeScript configuration for React libraries |

### Configuration

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| extends | string | "tsconfig/react-library.json" | Specifies the base configuration file to extend |
| include | array | ["."] | Defines which files to include in the compilation process |
| exclude | array | ["dist", "build", "node_modules"] | Specifies directories to exclude from compilation |

The configuration options in this file are as follows:

1. `extends`: This option specifies that the current configuration extends the settings from "tsconfig/react-library.json". This likely contains pre-defined settings optimized for React library development.

2. `include`: This array specifies which files should be included in the compilation process. In this case, it's set to `["."]`, which means all TypeScript files in the current directory and its subdirectories will be included.

3. `exclude`: This array specifies which directories should be excluded from the compilation process. It excludes the following directories:
   - "dist": Typically used for compiled output
   - "build": Another common directory for build artifacts
   - "node_modules": The directory containing third-party dependencies

This configuration ensures that only the relevant source files are compiled, excluding any build outputs or third-party code.
