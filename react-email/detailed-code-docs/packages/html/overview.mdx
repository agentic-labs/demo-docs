## High-level description
The `packages/html` directory contains the implementation of the `&lt;Html&gt;` component for the React Email library. This component serves as the root element for email templates, providing a way to set the language and text direction of the email content.

## What does it do?
The `&lt;Html&gt;` component creates the top-level `&lt;html&gt;` element for email templates built with React Email. It allows developers to specify the language and text direction of the email, defaulting to English (`en`) and left-to-right (`ltr`) respectively. This component is designed to wrap all other content in an email template, ensuring proper structure and accessibility.

## Key Files
1. `src/html.tsx`: Defines the `&lt;Html&gt;` component using React's `forwardRef` API. It renders an `&lt;html&gt;` element with configurable `lang` and `dir` attributes, along with any other props passed to it.

2. `src/html.spec.tsx`: Contains unit tests for the `&lt;Html&gt;` component, ensuring it renders correctly and produces the expected HTML output.

3. `src/index.ts`: Acts as the main entry point, re-exporting the `&lt;Html&gt;` component and its associated type (`HtmlProps`) for use in other parts of the library or user projects.

4. `package.json`: Defines the package configuration, including metadata, dependencies, and build scripts.

## Dependencies
- React (^18.0 || ^19.0 || ^19.0.0-rc): The core library for building the component.
- @react-email/render (workspace:*): Used in testing to render React components to HTML strings.

## Configuration
The package uses the following configuration files:

1. `.eslintrc.js`: Extends the "custom/react-internal" ESLint configuration, ensuring consistent code style and quality.

2. `tsconfig.json`: Extends a base TypeScript configuration for React libraries and specifies include/exclude paths for compilation.

## Example Usage
```jsx
import { Html } from "@react-email/html";

const EmailTemplate = () =&gt; (
  &lt;Html lang="en"&gt;
    {/* Other email content components */}
  &lt;/Html&gt;
);
```

This component provides a crucial foundation for building accessible and well-structured email templates using React Email. It ensures that the root `&lt;html&gt;` element is properly configured, allowing developers to focus on the content of their email templates while maintaining best practices for email HTML structure.
