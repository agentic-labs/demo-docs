## High-level description
This code is an index file that re-exports all the contents from the "html" module. It serves as a central point of access for the HTML-related components and types defined in the "html" module.

## Symbols

### `export * from "./html"`
#### Description
This is a re-export statement that makes all the exported symbols from the "./html" module available to consumers of this index file. It allows users to import HTML-related components and types from this index file instead of directly from the "html" module.

## Dependencies
The code indirectly depends on the contents of the "./html" module. Based on the related code snippet provided, we can infer that it includes:

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| React | Used for creating the `Html` component |

## References
The code references the following:

1. The "./html" module, which contains the actual implementation of HTML-related components and types.

Based on the related code snippet, we can see that the "./html" module exports:

1. `HtmlProps`: A type representing the props for the `Html` component.
2. `Html`: A React component for rendering the `&lt;html&gt;` element.

By using this index file, consumers can import these symbols like this:

```typescript
import { Html, HtmlProps } from 'path/to/packages/html';
```

This approach centralizes imports and can make it easier to manage and organize the package's exports.
