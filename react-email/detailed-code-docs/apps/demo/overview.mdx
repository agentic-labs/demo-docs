## High-level description
The `apps/demo` directory contains a demonstration application that showcases various email templates built using the `@react-email` library. This directory includes a collection of React components for generating HTML email templates, configuration files, and the necessary setup for a Next.js application.

## What does it do?
The demo application serves several purposes:

1. Email Template Showcase: It provides a comprehensive set of email templates for various scenarios, including authentication, notifications, newsletters, receipts, password resets, reviews, and welcome emails. These templates are designed to mimic the styles of popular services like AWS, GitHub, Vercel, Yelp, Apple, Nike, Dropbox, Twitch, Airbnb, Amazon, Koala, Netlify, and Stripe.

2. Development Environment: It sets up a development environment for creating and testing email templates using React and Next.js.

3. Export Functionality: It allows developers to export the email templates for use in other applications or email sending services.

4. Demonstration of @react-email Usage: It showcases how to use the `@react-email` library and its components to create responsive and visually appealing email templates.

## Entry points
The main entry points for this demo application are:

1. Email Components: Located in the `emails` subdirectory, these React components are the core of the application. Each component represents a different email template and can be imported and used individually.

2. Next.js Application: The `package.json` file indicates that this is a Next.js application, which likely has standard entry points such as `pages/index.js` or `pages/_app.js` (not visible in the provided directory structure).

3. Build and Development Scripts: The `package.json` file defines scripts for building, developing, and exporting the application, which serve as entry points for different stages of the development lifecycle.

## Key Files
1. `emails/` directory: Contains all the email template components, organized into subdirectories based on their purpose (e.g., authentication, notifications, newsletters).

2. `package.json`: Defines the project's dependencies, scripts, and metadata. It's crucial for setting up and running the application.

3. `license.md`: Contains the MIT license for the project, defining the terms under which the software can be used, modified, and distributed.

## Dependencies
The project relies on several key dependencies:

1. `@react-email/components` (version not specified): Provides React components specifically designed for creating HTML emails.

2. `react` (version not specified): The core React library for building user interfaces.

3. `react-dom` (version not specified): Provides DOM-specific methods for React.

4. `react-email` (version not specified): The core library for building emails with React.

5. `next` (version not specified): A React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation.

Development dependencies include TypeScript-related packages (`@types/react`, `@types/react-dom`, `tsx`) for improved development experience with type checking.

These dependencies were chosen to create a robust development environment for building and testing email templates using React and Next.js, with the added benefit of TypeScript support.

## Configuration
The application uses the following configuration:

1. Environment Variables:
   - `VERCEL_URL`: Used to dynamically construct the base URL for image sources and links within the emails. It's typically set when the application is deployed on the Vercel platform.

2. Scripts (defined in `package.json`):
   - `build`: Installs dependencies and builds the application.
   - `dev`: Runs the application in development mode.
   - `start`: Starts the application.
   - `export`: Exports the application, likely generating static files for the email templates.

3. Inline Styles: Each email component includes inline styles defined as JavaScript objects to ensure consistent appearance across different email clients.

In summary, the `apps/demo` directory contains a comprehensive demonstration of email template creation using React and the `@react-email` library. It provides a wide range of customizable, responsive email templates along with the necessary setup for development, testing, and exporting these templates. This demo serves as both a showcase of the library's capabilities and a starting point for developers looking to implement similar email functionality in their own projects.
