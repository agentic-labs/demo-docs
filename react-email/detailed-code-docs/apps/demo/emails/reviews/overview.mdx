## High-level description
The `apps/demo/emails/reviews` directory houses React components that generate HTML markup for various review-related email templates. These templates are designed to be sent to users after they've interacted with a product or service, prompting them to leave a review.

## What does it do?
This directory contains components that produce the HTML content for emails asking users to leave reviews. These emails might be sent after a purchase on an e-commerce platform or after a stay at an Airbnb. The components take in data like the reviewer's name, product details, or booking information and use it to personalize the email content. They utilize a library specifically designed for building emails in React, ensuring the layout and styling are compatible with email clients.
