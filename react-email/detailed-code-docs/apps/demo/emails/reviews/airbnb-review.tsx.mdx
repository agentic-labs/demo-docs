## Code Structure
The `AirbnbReviewEmail` component uses several components from the `@react-email/components` library to structure the email content. It also defines several inline style objects to customize the appearance of the email elements.

### `AirbnbReviewEmail`
#### Description
This functional component generates the HTML markup for an Airbnb review email. It takes in props like the author's name, image, and review text to personalize the email.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| authorName | string | The name of the person who wrote the review. |
| authorImage | string | The URL of the reviewer's profile image. |
| reviewText | string | The text content of the review. |

#### Outputs
React component that renders the HTML for an Airbnb review email.

#### Internal Logic
The component structures the email using a combination of `@react-email/components` and inline styles. It first displays the Airbnb logo, followed by the reviewer's image and name. The main section presents the review text within a styled container. The email then informs the recipient that the review period is over and their review is published on their Airbnb profile. It also provides a call to action button to send feedback to the reviewer. Finally, the email includes a FAQ section with links to relevant Airbnb help articles and contact information.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @react-email/components | Provides React components specifically designed for creating HTML emails. |
| react | Used for building the user interface of the component. |

## Configuration
The `baseUrl` variable is dynamically set based on the `VERCEL_URL` environment variable. This allows the email to correctly reference static assets like the Airbnb logo and user images.

## Error Handling
The code does not implement specific error handling beyond basic exception raising.

## Logging
The code does not implement any logging mechanisms.
