## High-level description
This directory contains React components that render HTML emails for password reset functionality in the demo application. It includes separate components for different platforms, each tailored to the specific brand and messaging.

## What does it do?
This directory provides the email templates used for password reset notifications in the demo application. When a user requests a password reset, the application will use these components to generate an email specific to the platform they are using (e.g., Dropbox or Twitch). The emails inform users about the password reset and provide instructions on how to proceed.

## Key Files
* **dropbox-reset-password.tsx:** This file defines the `DropboxResetPasswordEmail` component, which renders the password reset email for Dropbox users. It includes a personalized greeting, instructions for resetting the password, and a link to complete the process.
* **twitch-reset-password.tsx:** This file defines the `TwitchResetPasswordEmail` component, which renders the password reset email for Twitch users. It informs users about the password update, provides the date of the update, and includes links for security advice and support.

## Dependencies
* **@react-email/components:** This library provides pre-built React components specifically designed for creating responsive HTML emails. It simplifies the process of building and styling email templates.
* **react:** This is the core library for building user interfaces in React applications. 

## Configuration
Both email components use the `VERCEL_URL` environment variable to construct the base URL for static assets, such as images used in the emails. If the variable is not set, it defaults to an empty string.
