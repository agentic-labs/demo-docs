## High-level description
This directory contains React components that render HTML email templates for various purposes, including promoting a CodePen challenge, announcing a Google Play policy update, and providing tips for searching on Stack Overflow. Each email template is self-contained in its own file and utilizes the `@react-email/components` library for structuring the email content.

## What does it do?
This directory houses the code for generating HTML emails for different purposes. Each file in this directory corresponds to a specific type of email, such as a promotional email for a CodePen challenge or an informational email about a Google Play policy update. These email templates are built using React components and are designed to be dynamically populated with data.

For example, the `codepen-challengers.tsx` file defines an email template that promotes a CodePen challenge. This template includes sections for the challenge description, ideas, resources, and a call to action. The content of these sections can be easily updated to reflect the details of a specific challenge.

Similarly, the `google-play-policy-update.tsx` file contains an email template that informs Google Play developers about updates to the Google Play Target API Level policy. This template includes information about the policy changes, exceptions, the extended deadline, and links to relevant resources.

The `stack-overflow-tips.tsx` file defines an email template that provides tips for effectively searching on Stack Overflow. This template includes a header with the Stack Overflow logo, a section with search tips, and a footer with links to manage email preferences and contact information.

These email templates can be used to send out mass emails to users or developers. The dynamic nature of these templates allows for personalization and ensures that the information in the emails is always up-to-date.
