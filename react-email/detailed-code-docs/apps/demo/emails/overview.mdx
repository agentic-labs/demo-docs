## High-level description
The `apps/demo/emails` directory contains a collection of React components that generate HTML email templates for various purposes, including authentication, notifications, newsletters, receipts, password resets, reviews, and welcome emails. These templates are designed to be used across different applications and services, such as AWS, GitHub, Vercel, Yelp, Apple, Nike, Dropbox, Twitch, Airbnb, Amazon, Koala, Netlify, and Stripe.

## What does it do?
This directory provides a comprehensive set of email templates that can be used in different scenarios:

1. Authentication and Verification: Generates emails for account verification, magic link authentication, and login code verification for services like AWS, JobAccepted, Linear, Notion, Plaid, Raycast, and Slack.

2. Notifications: Creates email notifications for events such as GitHub access token creation, Vercel team invitations, and Yelp recent logins.

3. Newsletters: Produces promotional and informational emails, including CodePen challenges, Google Play policy updates, and Stack Overflow search tips.

4. Receipts: Renders email receipts styled after popular brands like Apple and Nike.

5. Password Reset: Generates password reset emails for platforms such as Dropbox and Twitch.

6. Reviews: Creates email templates for soliciting reviews from users, such as Airbnb host reviews and Amazon product reviews.

7. Welcome Emails: Produces onboarding emails for new users of platforms like Koala, Netlify, and Stripe.

Each email template is designed to be responsive, visually appealing, and consistent with the branding of the respective service. The templates can be easily customized with dynamic content using props passed to the React components.

## Entry points
The main entry points for this directory are the individual React components within each subdirectory. Developers can import these components and use them to generate HTML email content for their specific use cases. The workflow typically involves:

1. Importing the desired email component
2. Passing necessary props to customize the email content
3. Rendering the component to generate the HTML email markup
4. Sending the generated HTML as the email body using an email delivery service

## Dependencies
The primary dependencies used across these email components are:

1. `@react-email/components`: A library that provides React components specifically designed for creating HTML emails. It's used extensively to structure email content and ensure responsiveness across different email clients.

2. `react`: The core React library used to create functional components that render the email templates.

## Configuration
The email components use environment variables for configuration, primarily:

- `VERCEL_URL`: Used to dynamically construct the base URL for image sources and links within the emails. It's typically set when the application is deployed on the Vercel platform.

Example usage:
```javascript
const baseUrl = process.env.VERCEL_URL
  ? `https://${process.env.VERCEL_URL}`
  : '';
```

This configuration allows the email templates to use absolute URLs for images and links, ensuring they work correctly when sent to users' email clients.

Each email component also includes inline styles to define the appearance of various elements within the email. These styles are typically defined as JavaScript objects at the top of each component file to ensure consistent appearance across different email clients.

In summary, the `apps/demo/emails` directory provides a comprehensive set of React components for generating HTML email templates for various purposes. These components are designed to be easily customizable, responsive, and compatible with different email clients, making them suitable for use in a wide range of applications and services.
