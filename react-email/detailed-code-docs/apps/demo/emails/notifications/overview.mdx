## High-level description
This directory contains React components for generating email notifications for various services, including GitHub, Vercel, and Yelp. These components are designed to create responsive HTML email templates using the `@react-email/components` library.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory creates email templates for different scenarios:

1. GitHub Access Token Creation: Notifies users when a new personal access token is created on their GitHub account.
2. Vercel Team Invitation: Sends an invitation email to join a Vercel team.
3. Yelp Recent Login: Alerts users about a recent login to their Yelp account.

These email templates are structured using React components and include personalized information, relevant links, and styling to create professional-looking notifications.

## Key Files

1. `github-access-token.tsx`: 
   - Renders an email notification for a new GitHub access token creation.
   - Includes a button to view the token and links to security audit log and support.

2. `vercel-invite-user.tsx`:
   - Generates an HTML email for Vercel team invitations.
   - Includes personalized information like user names, team details, and an invitation link.

3. `yelp-recent-login.tsx`:
   - Creates an email notification for recent logins to a Yelp account.
   - Displays login details such as time, device, and location.

Each file exports a React functional component that takes specific props to customize the email content.

## Dependencies
The main external dependency used across these components is `@react-email/components`, which provides React components specifically designed for building responsive HTML emails. The core React library is also used for component creation and management.

## Configuration
All components use the `VERCEL_URL` environment variable to construct base URLs for static assets (like images) used in the emails. If this variable is not set, it defaults to an empty string.

Example usage of the environment variable:

```typescript
const baseUrl = process.env.VERCEL_URL ? `https://${process.env.VERCEL_URL}` : '';
```

This configuration allows for flexible deployment across different environments while ensuring correct asset URLs.

The email components are highly customizable through their props, allowing for personalized content such as usernames, dates, and specific details relevant to each notification type.

For instance, the `YelpRecentLoginEmail` component accepts props like:

```typescript
{
  userFirstName: string;
  loginDate: Date;
  loginDevice: string;
  loginLocation: string;
  loginIp: string;
}
```

These props are then used to populate the email template with specific user and login information.

Overall, this directory provides a set of reusable, customizable email notification templates that can be easily integrated into larger applications for GitHub, Vercel, and Yelp services.
