## High-level description
The code defines a React component, `NetlifyWelcomeEmail`, that renders a welcome email for new Netlify users. It uses the `@react-email/components` library to construct the email's structure and styling. The email includes a welcome message, steps to get started with Netlify, and links to resources.

## Code Structure
The `NetlifyWelcomeEmail` component uses the `PropDefaults` object to define default content for the email, including steps and links. The component renders a structured email layout with a header, body, and footer, using components like `Container`, `Heading`, `Section`, `Row`, and `Column` for layout. It also uses `Img` to display the Netlify logo and `Button` for a call to action.

## Symbols

### `NetlifyWelcomeEmail`
#### Description
This functional React component renders a welcome email for new Netlify users. It takes optional props for customizing the steps and links displayed in the email.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| steps | `{ id: number; Description: React.ReactNode }[]` | An array of objects representing steps to get started with Netlify. Each step has an `id` and a `Description` which can be a ReactNode. |
| links | `string[]` | An array of strings representing links to Netlify resources. |

#### Outputs
Returns a React component representing the rendered HTML of the welcome email.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Default Props:** If `steps` or `links` are not provided, it uses default values from `PropDefaults`.
2. **Email Structure:** Renders the email structure using `@react-email/components` like `Html`, `Head`, `Preview`, `Body`, `Container`, `Heading`, `Section`, `Row`, `Column`, `Img`, `Link`, `Text`, and `Button`.
3. **Dynamic Content:** Maps over the `steps` and `links` arrays to render their content dynamically.
4. **Styling:** Uses Tailwind CSS for styling, with custom colors and spacing defined in the `Tailwind` component's `config` prop.
