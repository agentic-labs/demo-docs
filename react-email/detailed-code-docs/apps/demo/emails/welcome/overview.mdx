## High-level description
This directory contains React components that render welcome emails for different platforms: Koala, Netlify, and Stripe. Each component generates an HTML email tailored to the specific platform, including a welcome message, relevant instructions, and links to resources.

## What does it do?
This directory houses the code for generating welcome emails sent to new users of three different platforms: Koala, Netlify, and Stripe. Each platform has a dedicated React component that constructs the email's content and styling. These components use the `@react-email/components` library to ensure the emails render correctly in email clients.

When a new user signs up for one of these platforms, the corresponding welcome email component is called. This component dynamically generates an HTML email that includes:

- **A personalized welcome message:** This greets the new user and introduces them to the platform.
- **Platform-specific instructions:** These guide the user on how to get started, access resources, or complete initial setup steps.
- **Links to relevant resources:** These might include links to documentation, support, or other helpful information.
- **Branding elements:** Each email incorporates the platform's logo and color scheme for a consistent brand experience.

The generated HTML email is then sent to the new user, providing them with a welcoming and informative onboarding experience.

## Dependencies
All three email components share the following dependencies:

| Dependency | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `@react-email/components` | Provides React components specifically designed for constructing HTML emails, ensuring proper rendering across various email clients. |
| `react` | The core library for building user interfaces with React. |

## Configuration
Each email component utilizes the `VERCEL_URL` environment variable to dynamically construct the base URL for assets like logos. This suggests that these emails are intended for deployment on the Vercel platform.
