## High-level description
This directory contains components for rendering HTML email receipts styled after popular brands. Currently, it includes implementations for Apple and Nike receipts. These components are designed to be used in email templates, providing a visually appealing and familiar experience for users.

## What does it do?
This directory houses React components that generate the HTML content for email receipts, mimicking the style of well-known brands like Apple and Nike. When these components are rendered, they produce the HTML markup that forms the structure and content of an email receipt. This markup includes sections for order details, billing information, purchased items, and other relevant information, all styled to match the branding of the respective company.
