## Code Structure
The `MagicCodeEmail` component is a functional component that returns the JSX structure of the email.

The email content includes:
- A preview text "Sign in to jobaccepted.com"

- A title "Your authentication code"
- Instructions for the user on how to use the code
- A placeholder authentication code "564873"
- A "Sign in" button linking to "https://www.jobaccepted.com/"
- Instructions for users who did not request the code, including a link to contact support at "mailto:support@jobaccepted.com"

The styling for the email is defined inline using several constant objects, each representing a specific style for elements like the main container, company name, code title, code container, button, paragraph text, and link.
