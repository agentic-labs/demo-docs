### Configuration
The `baseUrl` variable is dynamically set based on the `VERCEL_URL` environment variable. If `VERCEL_URL` is defined, it's used to construct the base URL with `https://`. Otherwise, an empty string is used. This suggests the application might be deployed on Vercel, and the URL is determined at runtime.
