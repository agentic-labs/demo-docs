## High-level description
The `unreachable` function is a utility function that throws an error when an unreachable code branch is executed. It takes a `condition` argument of type `never` and an optional `message` argument.

## Symbols

### `unreachable`
#### Description
This function throws a `TypeError` when called. It's intended to be used in code branches that should never be reached during normal execution, such as the `default` case of a switch statement that already handles all possible values.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| condition | `never` | The value that led to the unreachable code. This should theoretically never be passed in, as the type `never` indicates that no value is assignable to it. |
| message | `string` | An optional error message to be thrown. If not provided, a default message including the `condition` is used. |

#### Outputs
This function does not return any value. Instead, it throws a `TypeError`.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Constructs the error message:**
    - If a `message` argument is provided, it's used directly.
    - Otherwise, a default message is constructed: `Entered unreachable code. Received '${condition}'.`
    - If the `condition` is not a string, it's stringified using `JSON.stringify`.
2. **Throws a `TypeError` with the constructed message.**

#### Side Effects
- Throws a `TypeError`, potentially halting program execution.

#### Performance Considerations
This function is intended for development and debugging purposes. In production code, it's expected that unreachable branches are eliminated, making the performance impact of this function irrelevant.
