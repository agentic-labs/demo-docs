## High-level description
This CSS file defines global styles for a web application, including Tailwind CSS configuration, scroll behavior, and element isolation for improved rendering performance. It also sets up a basic layout structure with a dark background, specific font styles, and responsive container widths.

## References
- This file is referenced in `apps/web/src/app/layout.tsx` to apply the defined styles to the application's layout.

## Symbols
### `@tailwind base;`
#### Description
This line imports the base styles from the Tailwind CSS framework. These styles provide a reset and foundation for the application's styling.

#### Internal Logic
This directive instructs the CSS preprocessor to include the base styles defined by Tailwind CSS.

### `@tailwind components;`
#### Description
This line imports the component styles from the Tailwind CSS framework. These styles provide pre-defined styles for common UI elements.

#### Internal Logic
This directive instructs the CSS preprocessor to include the component styles defined by Tailwind CSS.

### `@tailwind utilities;`
#### Description
This line imports the utility classes from the Tailwind CSS framework. These classes provide a wide range of pre-defined styles for quick and easy styling.

#### Internal Logic
This directive instructs the CSS preprocessor to include the utility classes defined by Tailwind CSS.

### `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference) { ... }`
#### Description
This media query applies smooth scrolling behavior to all elements when the user has not expressed a preference for reduced motion.

#### Internal Logic
- It targets users who have not explicitly enabled the "Reduce Motion" accessibility setting in their operating system.
- It sets the `scroll-behavior` property to `smooth` for all elements, resulting in smooth scrolling animations.

### `#root, #__next { ... }`
#### Description
This CSS rule applies isolation to the `#root` and `#__next` elements, which are typically used as the root elements for single-page applications.

#### Internal Logic
- It selects the elements with the IDs `root` and `#__next`.
- It sets the `isolation` property to `isolate`, which creates a new stacking context for the elements and their descendants. This can improve rendering performance by isolating the elements from the rest of the DOM tree.
