## High-level description
The code defines a React component called `Menu` that renders a navigation menu with links to different sections of a website and social media icons. It provides two different layouts: a horizontal layout for larger screens and a drawer-based layout for smaller screens.

## Code Structure
The `Menu` component uses several helper components and constants:
- `MenuItem`: Represents a single menu item with a link.
- `MenuItems`: Renders a group of menu items for website sections.
- `SocialIcons`: Renders a group of social media icons.
- `GITHUB_URL`, `DISCORD_URL`: Constants for social media URLs.

The `Menu` component itself manages the state of the drawer and renders either the horizontal or drawer-based layout based on screen size.

## References
- `Drawer` from the `vaul` library.
- `MenuIcon` from the `lucide-react` library.
- `Link` from the `next/link` library.

#### Internal Logic
- Uses the `useState` hook to manage the `isDrawerOpen` state, which determines whether the drawer is open or closed.
- Renders a horizontal navigation bar with menu items and social icons for larger screens.
- Renders a drawer-based navigation menu for smaller screens.
- The `handleItemClick` function is called when any menu item or social icon is clicked, which closes the drawer if it's open.
