## High-level description
The `PageTransition` component provides a smooth transition effect when navigating between pages or sections within a Next.js application. It uses Framer Motion to animate the opacity and vertical position of the content, creating a visually appealing transition.

## Code Structure
The `PageTransition` component utilizes the `AnimatePresence` and `motion` components from the Framer Motion library to manage the animation state and apply animation properties to its children. It accepts props for customization, such as the HTML tag to render, custom class names, and a unique key for animation tracking.

## References
- `classNames`: A utility for conditionally joining class names.
- `AnimatePresence`, `motion`: Components from the Framer Motion library for animation control.

### `PageTransition`
#### Description
This functional component renders a container element (defaulting to a `div`) that animates its children using Framer Motion. It provides a smooth transition effect for page changes or content updates.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| tag | MotionComponentType | (Optional) The HTML tag to render for the container. Defaults to "div". |
| children | React.ReactNode | The content to be animated during the transition. |
| className | string | (Optional) Additional CSS class names to apply to the container. |
| key | string | A unique key to identify the animation instance. Required for `AnimatePresence` to work correctly. |

#### Outputs
A React element representing the animated container with the specified tag, class names, and children.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Determine the Motion Component:** Based on the provided `tag` prop, it selects the appropriate component from `framer-motion` to apply animation properties.
2. **Render with AnimatePresence:** It uses `AnimatePresence` to manage the animation lifecycle (mounting and unmounting) of the component.
3. **Apply Animation Properties:** The `MotionComponent` is configured with `animate`, `initial`, and `transition` props to define the animation states and timing.
   - `animate`: Defines the target state of the animation (opacity: 1, y: 0).
   - `initial`: Defines the starting state of the animation (opacity: 0, y: 4).
   - `transition`: Specifies the animation duration, easing function, and other transition properties.
4. **Render Children:** The provided `children` are rendered within the animated container.
