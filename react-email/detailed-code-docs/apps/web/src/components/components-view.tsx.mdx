## High-level description
The `ComponentsView` component is responsible for rendering a list of components. It iterates over an array of `RenderedComponent` objects and renders each one using the `ComponentView` component. 

It adds a top border to each component view except for the first one.

## Code Structure
The `ComponentsView` component is a simple functional component that takes a single prop, `components`, which is an array of `RenderedComponent` objects. It maps over the `components` array and renders a `ComponentView` component for each one.

## References
- `ComponentView`: This component is used to render each individual component.
- `RenderedComponent`: This type defines the structure of the component data passed to `ComponentView`.

### `ComponentsView`
#### Description
This functional component renders a list of components, each displayed using the `ComponentView` component. It applies a top border to all but the first component in the list.

#### Internal Logic

2. **For each `component` in the array:**
   - Renders a `ComponentView` component.
   - Passes the current `component` and a dynamically generated `className` to the `ComponentView`.
   - The `className` applies a top border if the component is not the first one in the array.
