### `IconButton`
#### Description
This functional component renders a styled button element specifically designed for icon-based buttons. It applies a set of default styles for appearance and accessibility, and allows for customization through props.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| children | `React.ReactNode` | The content to be rendered within the button, typically an icon component. |
| className | `string` | Optional. Additional CSS class names to apply to the button element. |
| ...props | `IconButtonProps` | Any other valid props for a button element. |

#### Outputs
- A styled `button` element containing the provided children and props.

#### Internal Logic
1. The component uses the `classNames` function to construct the CSS class string for the button element.
2. It applies default styles for rounded corners, padding, text color, transitions, hover effects, and focus states.
3. It merges any provided `className` prop with the default styles.
4. The button's `type` attribute is set to "button" to prevent unintended form submission behavior.
5. Finally, it renders the provided `children` within the styled button element.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| classNames | Used for conditionally applying CSS class names to the button element. |
