### `Footer`
#### Description
This functional component renders a footer element containing an attribution line with a link to the Resend website.

#### Inputs
This component does not accept any props.

#### Outputs
Returns a React fragment containing the rendered footer element.

#### Internal Logic
The component renders a `&lt;footer&gt;` element with flexbox styling for alignment. Inside, it uses the `Text` component to display the attribution text "Brought to you by". An `Anchor` component is used to create a clickable link to the Resend website, which includes an image of the Resend logo.

## Dependencies
- `next/image`: Used for displaying optimized images.
- `react`: Used for core React functionality.
