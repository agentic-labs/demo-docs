## High-level description
The `Code` component displays a code snippet with syntax highlighting, a copy button, and optional line numbers. It uses the `prism-react-renderer` library for syntax highlighting and provides a visually appealing presentation of code blocks.

## Code Structure
The `Code` component uses the `Highlight` component from `prism-react-renderer` to handle syntax highlighting. It also utilizes the `IconButton` component for the copy button and `classnames` for conditional class styling. The `theme` object defines the syntax highlighting styles.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| prism-react-renderer | Provides syntax highlighting for code snippets. |
| lucide-react | Provides icons for the copy button. |
| classnames | Utility for conditionally applying CSS classes. |

## Symbols

### `Code`
#### Description
A React functional component that renders a code snippet with syntax highlighting, a copy button, and optional line numbers.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| children | string | The code snippet to be displayed. |
| className | string (optional) | Additional CSS classes to apply to the code block. |
| language | string (optional) | The programming language of the code snippet (defaults to "html"). |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSX.Element | React element | A rendered code block with syntax highlighting and a copy button. |

#### Internal Logic
1. **State Management:** Uses `useState` to track whether the code has been copied (`isCopied`).
2. **Syntax Highlighting:** Utilizes `prism-react-renderer`'s `Highlight` component to apply syntax highlighting based on the provided `language`.
3. **Copy Functionality:**
    - An `IconButton` is used for the copy button, displaying either a `ClipboardIcon` or a `CheckIcon` based on the `isCopied` state.
    - When clicked, the button copies the code to the clipboard using `navigator.clipboard.writeText` and updates the `isCopied` state.
    - After a timeout, the `isCopied` state is reset to `false`.
4. **Styling:**
    - Applies default styles for the code block, including font, background, border, and padding.
    - Uses `classnames` to conditionally apply additional classes based on props and state.
    - Defines a custom `theme` object to customize the syntax highlighting colors.
5. **Line Numbers:**
    - Conditionally renders a "$" symbol before each line if the `language` is "bash" and there's only one line of code.

#### Side Effects
- Modifies the system clipboard when the copy button is clicked.

#### Performance Considerations
- The component uses a timeout to reset the `isCopied` state, which could be optimized by using a more efficient state management approach if performance becomes an issue.
