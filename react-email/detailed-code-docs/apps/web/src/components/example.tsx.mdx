## High-level description
The `Example` component renders a preview card for an email template. It displays a thumbnail of the email, its name, and author. Clicking the card opens a live preview of the email in a new tab.

## Code Structure
The `Example` component uses the `Image` component from `next/image` to display the email thumbnail and the `Link` component from `next/link` to create a clickable card that opens the live preview. It also utilizes the `Heading` and `Text` components for displaying the email name and author information.

## Symbols

### `Example`
#### Description
A React functional component that renders a preview card for an email template.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| path | `string` | The path to the email template, used for both the preview link and constructing the image source. |
| name | `string` | The name of the email template. |
| className? | `string` | Optional. Additional CSS class names to apply to the component. |
| author | `string` | The GitHub username of the email template author. |

#### Outputs
JSX.Element representing the email preview card.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Extracts email name:** Extracts the email name from the `path` prop.
2. **Manages image source:** Uses a state variable to store the image source. Initially, it constructs the source using the email name. If the image fails to load, it defaults to a placeholder image.
3. **Renders the card:** Renders a `Link` component that wraps an `Image` component (for the thumbnail) and a div containing the email name and author information.

## Side Effects
- **Fetches image:** When the component mounts, it attempts to fetch the email preview thumbnail from the constructed image source.
- **Navigates to preview:** When the user clicks the card, it opens a new tab and navigates to the email preview URL constructed using the `path` prop.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `classnames` | For conditionally joining CSS class names. |
| `next/image` | For displaying optimized images. |
| `next/link` | For creating links to other pages. |

## Error Handling
Throws an error if the `path` prop is empty or if the email name cannot be extracted from it.
