## High-level description
The `Spotlight` component creates a visual effect where a radial gradient follows the user's mouse cursor within its boundaries. This is achieved using Framer Motion to track mouse position and dynamically update the gradient's center point.

## Code Structure
The `Spotlight` component uses Framer Motion's `useMotionValue` hooks to track the mouse's X and Y coordinates. These values are then used within a `useMotionTemplate` to dynamically generate the radial gradient's position based on mouse movement. The component also utilizes event listeners to capture mouse movements within its container.

### `Spotlight`
#### Description
A React component that renders a radial gradient that follows the user's mouse cursor, creating a spotlight effect.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| children | ReactNode | The content to be rendered within the spotlight container. |
| className | string | Optional. Additional CSS class names to apply to the container. |

#### Outputs
This function renders a React component and doesn't return any value.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Mouse Position Tracking:** Uses `useMotionValue` hooks to create reactive variables (`mouseX`, `mouseY`) that store the current mouse coordinates within the component.
2. **Event Handling:** Attaches an `onMouseMove` event listener to the container. On each mouse movement, it calculates the mouse position relative to the container's top-left corner and updates the `mouseX` and `mouseY` values.
3. **Dynamic Gradient Generation:** Employs `useMotionTemplate` to create a dynamic radial gradient string. The template uses the `mouseX` and `mouseY` values to position the gradient's center, resulting in the spotlight effect.
4. **Rendering:** Renders a container `&lt;div&gt;` with the provided `className` and the `onMouseMove` handler.
5. **Content and Overlay:** Renders the `children` within the container and an absolutely positioned `&lt;motion.div&gt;` with the dynamic gradient as its background. This overlay is styled to be initially transparent and gains opacity on hover, creating a smooth transition.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| classNames | Utility for conditionally joining CSS class names. |
| framer-motion | Animation library for creating smooth and interactive animations. |

## Side Effects
- Attaches an event listener to the `onMouseMove` event of the container element.

## Performance Considerations
- The use of `useMotionValue` and `useMotionTemplate` from Framer Motion ensures performant animation by directly manipulating the DOM.
- The gradient overlay has a `transition` applied to its `opacity`, creating a smooth visual effect on hover.
- The component utilizes CSS transitions and transforms for optimal performance.
