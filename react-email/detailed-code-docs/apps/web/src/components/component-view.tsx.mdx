title: "component-view.tsx"

## High-level description
The `ComponentView` component displays a single component from the Radix Primitives website's component library. It provides a tabbed interface to view the component in desktop and mobile sizes, as well as its source code in different styling solutions (Tailwind CSS or inline styles).

## Code Structure
The `ComponentView` component uses several functional components internally: `TabTrigger`, `TabContent`, `ComponentPreview`, and `CodeBlock`. It also utilizes the `Tabs` component from the `@radix-ui/react-tabs` library and the `Select` component from the `@radix-ui/react-select` library for its UI.

## References
- `RenderedComponent`: This type is defined in `components-view.tsx` and represents a component with its HTML representation.
- `CodeVariant`: This type is defined in `app/components/get-components.ts` and defines the available code variants (Tailwind CSS or inline styles).

### `ComponentView`
#### Description
This component renders a single component view with tabs for desktop, mobile, and code views. It allows users to switch between different views and copy the component's code.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| component | RenderedComponent | The component to display, including its HTML and code. |
| className | string (optional) | Additional CSS classes to apply to the component view. |

#### Outputs
This component renders the component view.

#### Internal Logic
1. **State Management:**
   - `activeView`: Stores the currently active view ("code", "desktop", or "mobile").
   - `selectedCodeVariant`: Stores the selected code variant ("tailwind" or "inline-styles").
   - `isCopied`: Tracks whether the code has been copied to the clipboard.
2. **Effect Hooks:**
   - Sets the initial active view based on the current state.
   - Sets the initial code variant based on local storage or defaults to "tailwind".
3. **Code Selection and Copying:**
   - Retrieves the appropriate code based on the selected code variant.
   - Handles code copying and provides feedback to the user.
4. **Rendering:**
   - Renders a tabbed interface using `Tabs.Root` from `@radix-ui/react-tabs`.
   - Each tab (desktop, mobile, code) renders its content using `TabContent`.
   - `ComponentPreview` is used to display the component in desktop and mobile views.
   - `CodeBlock` is used to display the component's code with syntax highlighting.
   - A dropdown menu using `Select.Root` from `@radix-ui/react-select` allows users to switch between code variants if available.
