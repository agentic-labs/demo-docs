## High-level description
The code defines a React component, `IconMonitor`, that renders an SVG icon of a computer monitor. This component is built using the `IconBase` component for common SVG properties and is designed to be reusable with customizable size and color.

## Code Structure
The `IconMonitor` component is a React functional component that uses `React.forwardRef` to allow passing refs to the underlying DOM element. It utilizes the `IconBase` component to render the base SVG structure and applies specific path data and styling for the monitor icon.

## References
 - `IconBase`: Used as the base component for rendering the SVG icon.
 - `IconProps`: An interface defining the props accepted by the icon components.
