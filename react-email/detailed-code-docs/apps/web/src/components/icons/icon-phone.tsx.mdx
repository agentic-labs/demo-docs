title: "icon-phone.tsx"

## High-level description
The code defines a React component, `IconPhone`, that renders an SVG icon of a phone. This component is likely used to display a visually consistent phone icon across the application.

## Code Structure
The `IconPhone` component is a functional component that uses React's `forwardRef` API to allow access to the underlying DOM element. It renders an `IconBase` component, passing along any received props. The `IconBase` component is responsible for rendering the basic SVG structure, while `IconPhone` defines the specific path elements that draw the phone icon.

## References
- `IconBase`: This component is imported from `./icon-base` and is responsible for rendering the base SVG element.
- `IconElement`: A type alias imported from `./icon-base` that defines the type of the SVG element.
- `IconProps`: An interface imported from `./icon-base` that defines the props accepted by the icon components.

### `IconPhone`
#### Description
This functional component renders an SVG icon of a phone. It leverages the `IconBase` component for the basic SVG structure and defines the specific paths to draw the phone shape.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ...props | `Readonly&lt;IconProps&gt;` |  Props to be passed to the underlying `IconBase` component. This may include properties like `size` to control the icon's dimensions. |

#### Outputs
React component that renders an SVG icon of a phone.

#### Internal Logic
1. The component uses `React.forwardRef` to allow parent components to access the underlying DOM element of the rendered SVG.
2. It renders an `IconBase` component, passing along all received props (`...props`) and the `forwardedRef`.
3. Within the `IconBase` component, two `&lt;path&gt;` elements are defined, each drawing a part of the phone icon:
    - The first path draws the outline of the phone.
    - The second path draws a small horizontal line representing the microphone.

## Dependencies
- `react`: This dependency provides the necessary React APIs for creating components and managing their lifecycle.

### Configuration
The `IconPhone` component itself doesn't define any specific configuration options. However, it accepts props that are passed down to the `IconBase` component, which might include configuration options for the icon's size and other visual attributes.
