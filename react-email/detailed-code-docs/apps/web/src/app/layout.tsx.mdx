## High-level description
The `RootLayout` component in `layout.tsx` defines the main layout structure for the React Email application. It sets up the basic HTML structure, includes global styles, imports and applies fonts, and renders common elements like the top navigation bar (`Topbar`) and footer (`Footer`).

## Code Structure
The `RootLayout` component uses several imported components and symbols:
- `Topbar`: Renders the top navigation bar.
- `Footer`: Renders the website footer.
- `inter` and `commitMono`: Local font definitions loaded using `next/font/local`.
- `metadata`: Defines metadata for the application.
- `viewport`: Sets the viewport configuration.
