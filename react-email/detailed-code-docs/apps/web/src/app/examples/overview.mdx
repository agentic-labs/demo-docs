## High-level description
The `Examples` component renders a page showcasing various email templates built with React Email. It displays a grid of example emails, each linking to a live preview. The page also includes a brief introduction to React Email and encourages contributions.

## Code Structure
The `Examples` component uses the `items` array to render individual `Example` components. Each `Example` component represents an email template and links to a live preview. The component also uses several other components for styling and layout, including `Image`, `PageTransition`, `Heading`, `Text`, and `Anchor`.
