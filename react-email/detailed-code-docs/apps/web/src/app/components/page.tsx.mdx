## High-level description
The `ComponentsPage` component renders a page showcasing different categories of React Email components. It dynamically imports illustrations for each category and provides links to individual component pages.

The `ComponentsPage` component uses the `componentsStructure` array to map and render each component category. It dynamically imports illustrations based on the category name and utilizes the `slugify` function for generating URL slugs.
