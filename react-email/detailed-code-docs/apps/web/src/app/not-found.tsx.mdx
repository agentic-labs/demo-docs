### `NotFound`
#### Description
This is a functional React component that renders a 404 Not Found page. It uses the `PageTransition` component to provide a smooth transition effect.

#### Inputs
This component does not accept any props.

#### Outputs
- **JSX.Element:** Renders a `div` element containing the 404 page content.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Background Styling:** A `div` with absolute positioning and a hidden overflow is used to create a background with diagonal lines using borders.
2. **Page Transition:** The `PageTransition` component wraps the main content, providing a fade-in and slide-up animation when the component mounts.
3. **Content:** The main content includes an `h1` heading with "404 Not Found" text and two paragraphs explaining that the page does not exist and suggesting to check the URL.
