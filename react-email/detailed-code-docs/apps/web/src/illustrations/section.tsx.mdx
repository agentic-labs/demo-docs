This code defines a React functional component called `IllustrationSection` that renders a styled `div` element. This component likely serves as a placeholder or container for illustrations within a larger layout. 

## Symbols

### `IllustrationSection`
#### Description
This React functional component renders a `div` element with specific styling to represent a section intended for illustrations. The styling suggests a dark, slightly rounded rectangle with a subtle gradient and hover effect.

#### Inputs
This component does not accept any props.

#### Outputs
This component renders a styled `div` element to the DOM.

#### Internal Logic
The component directly returns a `div` element with a set of inline styles applied. These styles define the appearance and behavior of the section:
- `relative flex aspect-video w-[40%] flex-col items-center gap-2 rounded-md border-[.1875rem] border-dashed border-slate-4 bg-[#0F0F10] bg-gradient-to-b from-transparent via-black/20 to-black/20 px-2 pb-4 pt-2 shadow-sm transition-transform duration-150 ease-[cubic-bezier(.42,0,.58,1.8)] group-hover:skew-x-2`:
    - `relative`: Sets the element's positioning context to relative.
    - `flex aspect-video w-[40%] flex-col items-center gap-2`: Defines it as a flex container, with aspect ratio of a video, 40% width, column direction, centered items and a gap of 2 units between them.
    - `rounded-md`: Applies medium rounded corners.
    - `border-[.1875rem] border-dashed border-slate-4`: Sets a dashed border with a specific thickness and color.
    - `bg-[#0F0F10] bg-gradient-to-b from-transparent via-black/20 to-black/20`: Defines a background color with a gradient from transparent at the top, to black with 20% opacity in the middle, and fully opaque black at the bottom.
    - `px-2 pb-4 pt-2`: Applies padding to the element.
    - `shadow-sm`: Adds a small shadow effect.
    - `transition-transform duration-150 ease-[cubic-bezier(.42,0,.58,1.8)] group-hover:skew-x-2`: Defines a transition effect for the transform property, with a duration of 150ms, a custom easing function, and a skew transformation on hover of the parent element (group).
