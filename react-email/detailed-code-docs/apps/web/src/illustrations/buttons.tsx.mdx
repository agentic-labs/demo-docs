## Symbols

### `IllustrationButtons`
#### Description
This React functional component renders a button illustration with a hover effect. The illustration includes a rounded rectangle representing the button and a mouse pointer icon. On hover, the button rotates slightly, and the mouse pointer icon rotates more dramatically.

#### Inputs
This component does not accept any props.

#### Outputs
Returns a React fragment containing the button illustration.

#### Internal Logic
The component uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling and positioning the elements. 
- A `div` with rounded corners and a blue background simulates the button. 
- A semi-transparent black `div` inside the button creates a highlight effect.
- The `MousePointer2Icon` from the `lucide-react` library is positioned near the button.
- The `group-hover` classes apply transformations (rotation) to both the button and the mouse pointer on hover, creating an interactive effect. 

## Dependencies
