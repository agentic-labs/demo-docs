### `IllustrationDivider`
#### Description
This React functional component renders a styled horizontal divider element. It uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling and includes a hover effect that skews the divider slightly.

#### Inputs
This component takes no props.

#### Outputs
Returns a `div` element representing the styled divider.

#### Internal Logic
The component returns a `div` element with nested `div` elements to create the visual structure of the divider:
- The outer `div` sets up the overall container with rounded corners, background gradient, padding, shadow, and a hover transition effect.
- Two inner `div`s with the class "bg-slate-5" represent the gray lines on either side of the central blue line.
- The central `div` creates the blue line with a border, background color, and a box shadow. It also includes a hover effect that scales it horizontally.
