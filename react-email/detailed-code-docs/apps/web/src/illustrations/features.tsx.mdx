## High-level description
The code defines a React functional component `IllustrationFeatures` that renders a placeholder illustration, likely representing a list of features. It consists of three rectangular divs styled to resemble UI elements, with a gradient background and hover effects.

## Code Structure
The `IllustrationFeatures` component directly renders three divs. The first two divs are styled as rounded rectangles with background color and hover effects. The third div is styled similarly but also includes four nested divs that represent placeholder list items.

## Symbols

### Symbol Name: `IllustrationFeatures`
#### Description
This functional component renders a placeholder illustration of UI elements, likely representing a feature list. It uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling and responsiveness.

#### Inputs
This component does not accept any props.

#### Outputs
Returns a React fragment (`&lt;&gt;`) containing three divs styled to resemble UI elements.

#### Internal Logic
The component directly renders the divs with pre-defined Tailwind CSS classes. The styling suggests:
- The first two divs are positioned absolutely and animated on hover to rotate and change background color.
- The third div is positioned relatively and contains four nested divs that represent list items. These items are also styled with background color, borders, and shadows.

#### Side Effects
This component has no side effects. It simply renders UI elements.

#### Performance Considerations
This component is relatively simple and shouldn't pose any performance concerns.
