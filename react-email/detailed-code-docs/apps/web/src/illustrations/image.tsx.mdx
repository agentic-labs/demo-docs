## Symbols

### `IllustrationImage`
#### Description
This React functional component renders a styled square container containing a Lucide "image" icon. It's designed to be a placeholder or illustration representing an image. The component includes a hover effect where the background darkens and the icon becomes more prominent.

#### Inputs
This component accepts no props.

#### Outputs
This component renders a `div` element styled to represent an image placeholder.

#### Internal Logic
The component uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling:
- `flex aspect-square w-[30%] items-center justify-center rounded-md`: Styles the container as a square with 30% width, rounded corners, centered content, and using flexbox for layout.
- `bg-slate-4 transition-colors group-hover:bg-slate-5`: Sets the background color and adds a transition effect on hover, darkening the background slightly.
- `opacity-5 transition-opacity group-hover:opacity-20`: Sets the initial opacity of the icon to 5% and adds a transition effect on hover, increasing the opacity to 20%.
