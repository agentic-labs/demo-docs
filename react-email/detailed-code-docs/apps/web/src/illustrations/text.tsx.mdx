### `IllustrationText`
#### Description
This React functional component renders a placeholder illustration that resembles a block of text. It uses CSS classes and inline styles to create the visual effect of lines and a background gradient.

#### Inputs
This component does not accept any props.

#### Outputs
- **JSX.Element:** A div element styled to represent a text placeholder.

#### Internal Logic
The component returns a div element with nested divs. 
- The outer div acts as a container, styled with rounded corners, background gradient, padding, and shadow. 
- The first inner div represents a single line of text with a light gray background. 
- The second inner div contains two more divs, representing lines of text with varying shades of gray.

#### Performance Considerations
This component is relatively simple and should not have any significant performance implications.
