### `IllustrationCodeInline`
#### Description
This functional React component renders a visual illustration of an inline code block. It uses a combination of CSS classes and elements to create the effect of a code snippet with a highlighted section.

#### Inputs
This component does not accept any props.

#### Outputs
Returns a JSX structure representing the inline code illustration.

#### Internal Logic
The component renders a parent `div` with styling to create a rounded rectangle with a gradient background. Inside, it places:
- A `ChevronRightIcon` to resemble the opening bracket of an inline code block.
- A smaller `div` with specific styling to represent the highlighted portion of the code.
- Another `div` with a flexible width to push the highlighted section to the left.
