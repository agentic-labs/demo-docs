### `IllustrationCodeBlock`
#### Description
This functional component renders a series of divs styled to resemble lines and highlights within a code block. It uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling and responsiveness.

#### Inputs
This component does not accept any props.

#### Outputs
This component renders a `&lt;div&gt;` element containing the styled code block illustration.

#### Internal Logic
