## High-level description
The code defines a React functional component called `IllustrationGrid` that renders a stylized grid illustration. This illustration likely represents a layout or design element within the application's user interface.

## Code Structure
The `IllustrationGrid` component is a self-contained unit that directly renders JSX elements to create the grid illustration. It doesn't have any internal methods or state.

## Symbols

### `IllustrationGrid`
#### Description
This functional component renders a grid illustration composed of four rectangular divs arranged in a 2x2 grid. The grid has a dark background with a subtle gradient and rounded corners. Each cell within the grid has its own background color and gradient, creating a visually appealing pattern. The bottom-right cell is highlighted with a border and a "move" icon, suggesting interactivity or repositioning.

#### Inputs
This component does not accept any props.

#### Outputs
This component renders a JSX representation of the grid illustration.

#### Internal Logic
The component directly returns the JSX structure of the grid. Each `&lt;div&gt;` element represents a cell in the grid, and their styling creates the visual appearance of the illustration. The `MoveDownRightIcon` from the `lucide-react` library is positioned in the bottom-right cell, further enhancing the visual representation.
