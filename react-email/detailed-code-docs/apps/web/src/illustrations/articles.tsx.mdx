### `IllustrationArticles`
#### Description
This React functional component renders a placeholder illustration resembling a stack of articles. It utilizes Tailwind CSS classes for styling and layout.

#### Inputs
This component takes no props.

#### Outputs
- **JSX.Element:** A div element containing the styled illustration.

#### Internal Logic
The component renders a parent div with rounded corners, a gradient background, and a hover effect that skews the element. Inside, it renders:
- A larger div representing the top article with a placeholder gray background.
- Two smaller divs below, also with placeholder gray backgrounds.
- A final small div with a distinct blue background and a border, simulating a highlighted or selected article.

#### Performance Considerations
This component is relatively simple and should not pose any performance concerns.
