## Symbols

### `IllustrationHeading`
#### Description
This React functional component renders a decorative heading element composed of four cascading horizontal bars. The bars have a subtle gradient background and a hover effect that scales them horizontally.

#### Inputs
This component takes no props.

#### Outputs
Returns a `div` element containing the styled heading bars.

#### Internal Logic
The component renders four nested `div` elements, each representing a bar in the heading. 
- Each bar is styled with a rounded-sm class for rounded corners and a background color from the Tailwind CSS slate palette (slate-6 being the darkest and slate-3 the lightest). 
- The width of each bar decreases progressively, creating the cascading effect. 
- The `transition-transform` and `group-hover:scale-x-105` classes are used to apply a subtle scaling animation on hover to the entire heading element.

## Dependencies
- **React:** This code is a React functional component and relies on the React library for rendering.
- **Tailwind CSS:** The styling of the component heavily relies on Tailwind CSS utility classes for layout, colors, and hover effects.
