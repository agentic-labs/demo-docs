## High-level description
This code defines a React functional component called `IllustrationLink` that renders a simple, static illustration of a link. The illustration is composed of several colored rectangles arranged to resemble a chain of links.

## Code Structure
The `IllustrationLink` component is a self-contained unit that doesn't interact with other symbols. It renders a series of nested divs with specific styles to create the visual representation of a link.

## Symbols

### `IllustrationLink`
#### Description
This React functional component renders a static illustration of a link using styled divs. The illustration consists of rectangles representing link segments and a highlighted segment to indicate an active or selected link.

#### Inputs
This component does not accept any props.

#### Outputs
This component renders a `div` element containing the link illustration.

#### Internal Logic
The component uses nested `div` elements with Tailwind CSS classes to style and position the rectangles that form the link illustration. The styles define the size, color, border, and shadow of each segment. The `group-hover` classes apply hover effects to specific segments, creating a visual cue for interaction.
