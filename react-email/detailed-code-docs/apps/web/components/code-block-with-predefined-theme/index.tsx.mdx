## High-level description
This code defines a React component that displays a pre-themed code block using the `@react-email/components` library. The code block showcases an example of using the `resend` library to send an email. This component is then rendered within a basic layout structure.

## References
- `Layout` component from `../_components/layout.tsx`

## Symbols
### `component`
#### Description
This is a React component that renders a code block with a predefined theme. It uses the `CodeBlock` component from the `@react-email/components` library to display a code snippet with syntax highlighting. The code snippet demonstrates how to send an email using the `resend` library.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props.

#### Outputs
- JSX.Element: A rendered code block component.

#### Internal Logic
The component directly renders a `CodeBlock` component with the following props:
- `code`: The code snippet to be displayed.
- `language`: The programming language of the code snippet, set to "javascript".
- `theme`: The theme to use for syntax highlighting, set to "dracula".

### `default`
#### Description
This is a default exported React component that serves as an entry point for rendering the code block component within a layout.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props.

#### Outputs
- JSX.Element: A rendered layout component containing the code block component.

#### Internal Logic
The component renders the `Layout` component and passes the `component` as its child. This ensures the code block is displayed within the defined layout structure.
