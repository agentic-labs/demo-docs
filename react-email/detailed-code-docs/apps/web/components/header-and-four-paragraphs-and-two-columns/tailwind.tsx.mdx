## High-level description
This code defines a React component that renders a section with a header, four paragraphs of text, and two columns of content. Each column contains two images with accompanying text. The component is wrapped in a layout component for consistent styling.

## Code Structure
The code defines a single React component, `component`, which is wrapped in a `Layout` component. The `component` itself uses a `Section` component for the overall structure and a `Row` component for the header. The two columns are implemented using a `table` element with two rows and two cells. Each cell contains an `Img` component for the image and `Text` components for the accompanying text.
