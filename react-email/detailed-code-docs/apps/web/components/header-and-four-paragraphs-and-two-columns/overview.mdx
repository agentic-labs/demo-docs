## High-level description
This directory contains two React components designed for use in email templates. Both components render a section with a header, four paragraphs of text, and two columns of content, each containing two images with accompanying text. The key difference between the two components lies in their styling approach: one uses inline styles (`inline-styles.tsx`), while the other leverages Tailwind CSS (`tailwind.tsx`).

## What does it do?
Both components provide a structured layout for presenting information in an email. They display a header followed by four paragraphs of introductory text. The content is then divided into two columns, each featuring two images with accompanying descriptions. This layout is particularly useful for showcasing products, services, or any information that can be presented in a visually appealing and easily digestible manner.

## Entry points
The main entry points for this directory are the two component files:

- `inline-styles.tsx`: This component defines the layout and styling using inline styles.
- `tailwind.tsx`: This component utilizes Tailwind CSS classes for styling.

Developers can choose the component that best suits their project's styling approach. Both components are wrapped in a `Layout` component, which provides basic HTML structure and optional Tailwind CSS support. This ensures consistency in styling and structure across different email components.
