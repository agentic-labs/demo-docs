## High-level description
This code defines a React component that renders an article preview with an image, title, short description, and a "Read more" button. It's designed for use in an email template, utilizing the `@react-email` library for styling and layout. The component is wrapped in a `Layout` component which provides basic email structure and styling.

## Code Structure
The code exports two symbols: `component` and a default function. The `component` is a React functional component that represents the article preview itself. The default function acts as a wrapper, rendering the `component` within a `Layout` component.

## Symbols
### `component`
#### Description
This functional component renders the visual structure and content of the article preview. It uses `@react-email` components for styling and layout elements like `Section`, `Img`, `Text`, `Heading`, and `Button`.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any explicit props.

#### Outputs
This component returns a React fragment containing the rendered HTML structure of the article preview.

#### Internal Logic
The component renders an image at the top, followed by a section containing the article title, a short description, and a "Read more" button. The styling and layout are achieved using Tailwind CSS classes.

### `default` (function)
#### Description
This is a default exported function that serves as a wrapper for the `component`. It renders the `component` within a `Layout` component, which provides basic email structure and styling.

#### Inputs
This function doesn't accept any explicit arguments.

#### Outputs
This function returns a React fragment containing the `component` rendered within the `Layout` component.
