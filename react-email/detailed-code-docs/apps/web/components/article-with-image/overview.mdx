## High-level description
The `apps/web/components/article-with-image` directory houses two React components designed to display an article preview with an image, title, short description, and a "Read more" button. These components are intended for use in email templates, with one utilizing inline styles (`inline-styles.tsx`) and the other leveraging Tailwind CSS (`tailwind.tsx`) for styling.

## What does it do?
This directory provides two different styling implementations for an article preview component meant for emails. Both components achieve the same visual result: displaying an article preview with an image, title, short description, and a button to read more. The difference lies in how they handle styling - one uses inline styles directly within the component, while the other relies on external Tailwind CSS classes. This offers flexibility depending on the project's styling preferences and setup.

## Entry points
Developers can choose between `inline-styles.tsx` or `tailwind.tsx` depending on their preferred styling method. Both files export a default function that renders the `article-with-image` component wrapped in a `Layout` component.

## Key Files
- **`inline-styles.tsx`**: This file defines the article preview component using inline styles for all visual elements. It relies on the `@react-email/components` library for email-safe rendering of components like `Section`, `Img`, `Text`, `Heading`, and `Button`.
- **`tailwind.tsx`**: This file defines the article preview component using Tailwind CSS classes for styling. It also utilizes `@react-email/components` for layout and email-safe rendering.

## Dependencies
Both `inline-styles.tsx` and `tailwind.tsx` depend on:

- **`@react-email/components`**: This library provides React components specifically designed for email rendering, ensuring compatibility with various email clients.
