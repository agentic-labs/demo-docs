## High-level description
The code defines a React component that renders an article preview with an image, title, short description, and a "Read more" button. It's designed for use in an email template, utilizing the `@react-email/components` library for email-safe rendering. The component is wrapped in a `Layout` component which sets up basic HTML structure and styling.

## Code Structure
The code exports two symbols: `component` and a default unnamed function. The `component` is a React functional component that represents the article preview itself. The default function wraps the `component` within a `Layout` component, which provides basic HTML structure and styling for an email template.

## Symbols

### `component`
#### Description
This functional component renders the visual structure and content of an article preview. It uses `@react-email/components` for elements like `Section`, `Img`, `Text`, `Heading`, and `Button` to ensure compatibility with email clients.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props.

#### Outputs
Returns a React component tree representing an article preview with an image, title, description, and a button.

#### Internal Logic
The component directly renders JSX, structuring the layout with `Section` components. It uses an `Img` component for the article image, `Heading` and `Text` components for the title and description, and a `Button` component for the "Read more" call to action. Inline styles are heavily used to control the appearance of these elements.

### `default` (unnamed function)
#### Description
This unnamed function serves as the default export of the module. It acts as a wrapper for the `component`, placing it within a `Layout` component.

#### Inputs
This function doesn't accept any props.

#### Outputs
Returns a React component tree consisting of the `component` wrapped in a `Layout` component.

#### Internal Logic
The function directly returns JSX, rendering the `Layout` component and passing the `component` as its child.
