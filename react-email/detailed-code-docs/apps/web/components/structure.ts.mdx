## High-level description
The code defines the structure and metadata for displaying React Email components on the website. It includes categories, component information, and a function to retrieve the file path of a component based on its slug.

## Code Structure
The code defines several interfaces and a constant array `componentsStructure`. The `getComponentPathFromSlug` function uses the `pathToComponents` constant and the input `slug` to construct the file path. The `componentsStructure` array utilizes the interfaces `Category` and `Component` to structure the component data.

## Symbols
### `pathToComponents`
#### Description
A constant string representing the absolute path to the components directory.

#### Internal Logic
It uses `process.cwd()` to get the current working directory and `path.resolve` to join it with "./components" to create the absolute path.

### `Category`
#### Description
An interface that defines the structure of a component category.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is an interface, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is an interface, not a function.

#### Internal Logic
It includes properties for the category's `name`, `description`, and an array of `components`.

### `Component`
#### Description
An interface that defines the structure of a component.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is an interface, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is an interface, not a function.

#### Internal Logic
It includes properties for the component's `slug` and `title`.

### `getComponentPathFromSlug`
#### Description
A function that takes a component slug as input and returns the absolute file path to that component.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| slug | string | The slug of the component. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
|  | string | The absolute file path to the component. |

#### Internal Logic
It uses `path.resolve` to join the `pathToComponents` with the input `slug`, creating the absolute file path.

### `componentsStructure`
#### Description
A constant array that defines the structure of all component categories and their respective components.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a constant, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a constant, not a function.

#### Internal Logic
It is an array of `Category` objects. Each `Category` object contains the category's `name`, `description`, and an array of `Component` objects. Each `Component` object contains the component's `slug` and `title`.
