## High-level description
This directory contains React components that display inline code snippets with a green background color. Two versions of the component are provided: one using inline styles and another using the `@react-email/components` library.

## What does it do?
This directory provides reusable components for displaying code snippets within text. These components ensure that the code snippets are visually distinct from the surrounding text by applying a green background color. This is useful for highlighting code examples or package names in documentation or tutorials.

## Entry points
The main entry points are `inline-styles.tsx` and `tailwind.tsx`.

- `inline-styles.tsx`: This component uses inline styles to achieve the green background color for the code snippet.
- `tailwind.tsx`: This component utilizes the `CodeInline` component from the `@react-email/components` library to style the code snippet.

Both components render the same text: "Install the `@react-email/components` package", highlighting the package name.

## Dependencies
- `@react-email/components`: Used in the `tailwind.tsx` component to style the inline code snippet. This library provides pre-built components for email development, including code styling.
