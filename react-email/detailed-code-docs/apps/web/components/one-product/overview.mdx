## High-level description
The `apps/web/components/one-product` directory contains two React components designed to display a single product within an email template. Both components present the same information: product image, title, description, price, and a "Buy now" button. The key difference lies in their styling approach: `inline-styles.tsx` uses inline styles, while `tailwind.tsx` leverages Tailwind CSS for styling.

## What does it do?
This directory provides two stylistic variations of a product display component for email templates. When an email needs to showcase a single product, developers can choose between the `inline-styles` or `tailwind` versions based on the project's styling preferences and whether Tailwind CSS is already integrated. Both components structure the product information consistently, ensuring a unified presentation regardless of the styling approach.

## Key Files
### `inline-styles.tsx`
This file defines a React component that renders a product display section using inline styles. It utilizes components from the `@react-email/components` library for email-safe rendering and structures the product information with elements like `Section`, `Img`, `Text`, `Heading`, and `Button`.

### `tailwind.tsx`
Similar to `inline-styles.tsx`, this file defines a React component for a product display section. However, it employs Tailwind CSS classes for styling instead of inline styles. It also utilizes components from the `@react-email/components` library for structure and email compatibility.

## Dependencies
Both components within this directory depend on the `@react-email/components` library. This library provides email-safe React components, ensuring that the rendered HTML is compatible with various email clients.
