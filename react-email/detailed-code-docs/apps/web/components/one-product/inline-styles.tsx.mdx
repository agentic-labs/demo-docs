## High-level description
The code defines a React component that renders a product display section for an email template. It showcases a product image, title, description, price, and a "Buy now" button. The component utilizes components from the `@react-email/components` library for email-safe rendering.

## Code Structure
The code exports two symbols: `component` and a default function. The `component` is a React component that defines the structure and content of the product display section. The default function wraps the `component` within a `Layout` component, likely for consistent styling and structure across different email templates.
