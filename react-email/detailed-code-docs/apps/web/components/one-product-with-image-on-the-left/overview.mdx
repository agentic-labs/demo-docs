## High-level description
This directory contains two React components that render a product display section for an email template. Both components present an image on the left and product details on the right. The key difference lies in their styling approach: `inline-styles.tsx` uses inline styles, while `tailwind.tsx` leverages Tailwind CSS.

## What does it do?
Both components render a visually consistent product display section suitable for email clients. They present a product image on the left and arrange product details like title, description, price, and a "Buy" button on the right. The components ensure proper layout and styling for optimal display within email clients.

## Entry points
The main entry points are `inline-styles.tsx` and `tailwind.tsx`. These represent two implementations of the same component with different styling approaches. Developers can choose the implementation that best suits their project's styling preferences and setup.
