## High-level description
The code defines a React component that renders a product display section in an email template. This section features an image on the left and product details on the right, laid out using a table for compatibility with email clients.

## Code Structure
The code exports two symbols: `component` and an anonymous default export. The `component` is a React functional component that represents the product display section. The anonymous default export is another React functional component that wraps the `component` within a `Layout` component.

## Symbols

### `component`
#### Description
This functional component renders a product display section with an image on the left and product information on the right. It uses a table to achieve the two-column layout.

#### Inputs
This component does not accept any props.

#### Outputs
Returns a React fragment containing a `Section` component with a table inside. The table contains an image, product title, description, price, and a "Buy" button.

#### Internal Logic
The component directly renders JSX elements to construct the layout. It uses inline styles for styling the elements. The layout is based on a table with two columns, one for the image and one for the product details.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @react-email/components | Provides React components specifically designed for email rendering, such as `Section`, `Img`, `Text`, and `Button`. |
| ../_components/layout | Imports a custom `Layout` component, likely providing a common structure or wrapper for the email template. |

## Side Effects
This code has no side effects. It simply renders UI elements.
