## High-level description
This code defines a React component that renders a product display section with an image on the left and product details on the right. It uses a table layout to position the image and details side-by-side. The component is then wrapped in a `Layout` component for consistent styling.

## Code Structure
The code defines two components: `component` and a default export. The `component` is a functional component that renders the product display section. The default export is another functional component that renders the `component` within a `Layout` component.

## References
- `Layout`: This component is imported from `../_components/layout.tsx` and provides a wrapper for the product display section.

## Symbols

### `component`
#### Description
This functional component renders a product display section with an image on the left and product details on the right. It uses a table layout to achieve the side-by-side positioning.

#### Inputs
This component does not accept any explicit inputs.

#### Outputs
This component returns a React element representing the product display section.

#### Internal Logic
The component uses a `&lt;table&gt;` element to create the layout. The image is placed in the left cell (`&lt;td&gt;`) and the product details are placed in the right cell. The `Img` component from `@react-email/components` is used to display the product image. The `Text` component from the same library is used to display the product title, description, and price. A `Button` component is used to provide a "Buy" button that links to `https://react.email`.

### `default` export
#### Description
This functional component renders the `component` within a `Layout` component.

#### Inputs
This component does not accept any explicit inputs.

#### Outputs
This component returns a React element representing the product display section wrapped in a `Layout` component.

#### Internal Logic
The component simply renders the `component` within the `Layout` component.
