## High-level description
This code defines a React component that renders a series of headings (H1 to H6) with the names of different people. Each heading is centered on the page. The component is then wrapped in a layout component for consistent styling.

## Code Structure
The code defines two symbols: `component` and an unnamed default export function. The `component` is a React fragment that holds the headings. The default export function renders the `component` within a `Layout` component.

## Symbols

### `component`
#### Description
This symbol is a React fragment that renders a series of six headings (H1 to H6), each containing a person's name. Each heading is styled with `text-center` class from Tailwind CSS to center it horizontally.

#### Inputs
This symbol doesn't take any inputs.

#### Outputs
This symbol renders a React fragment containing six headings.

#### Internal Logic
The component simply renders six `Heading` components from the `@react-email/components` library. Each heading is given a different `as` prop to specify the heading level (H1-H6) and the `className` prop is set to "text-center" for centering.

### `default export function`
#### Description
This is a default exported React component that renders the `component` within a `Layout` component.

#### Inputs
This symbol doesn't take any inputs.

#### Outputs
This symbol renders the `component` wrapped in a `Layout` component.

#### Internal Logic
The function returns a JSX element where the `component` is rendered as a child of the `Layout` component.
