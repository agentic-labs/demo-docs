## High-level description
This directory contains React components that demonstrate rendering multiple headings within an email, styled using two different methods: inline styles and Tailwind CSS. 

## What does it do?
This directory provides two example components for rendering a series of headings (H1 to H6) with different names, showcasing how to center headings within an email context. One component utilizes inline styles for centering, while the other leverages Tailwind CSS utility classes. Both components are wrapped in a `Layout` component for consistent styling and structure.

## Key Files
- **`inline-styles.tsx`**: This component demonstrates centering headings using inline styles.
- **`tailwind.tsx`**: This component showcases centering headings using Tailwind CSS's `text-center` utility class.

Both components utilize the `Heading` component from the `@react-email/components` library for rendering email-compatible headings and a `Layout` component (presumably from a shared location) for basic layout structure.
