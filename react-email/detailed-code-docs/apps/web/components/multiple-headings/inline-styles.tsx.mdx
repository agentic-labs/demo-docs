## High-level description
This code defines a React component that renders a series of headings (H1 to H6) with the names of different people. Each heading is centered horizontally using inline styles. The component is then wrapped in a `Layout` component for basic styling and structure.

## Code Structure
The code defines two symbols: `component` and a default exported anonymous function. The `component` is a React fragment containing a series of `Heading` components, each displaying a name. The default exported function renders the `component` within a `Layout` component.

## References
- `Heading`: This component is imported from the `@react-email/components` library and is used to render the headings.
- `Layout`: This component is imported from a local file `../_components/layout` and provides a basic layout structure.
