## High-level description
This directory contains two React components that render a footer with a single-column layout. The footer is intended for use in email templates and includes elements such as a logo, company name, tagline, social media links, address, and contact information. 

The two components, `inline-styles.tsx` and `tailwind.tsx`, offer different styling approaches:

- `inline-styles.tsx` uses inline styles for layout and styling.
- `tailwind.tsx` utilizes the Tailwind CSS framework for styling.

Both components share a similar structure and content, differing primarily in their styling implementation.

## What does it do?
Both components render a visually identical footer designed for email templates. They present the company's logo, name, tagline, social media links, address, and contact information in a single, vertically stacked column. The key difference lies in how they handle styling: one embeds styles directly into the elements, while the other leverages external CSS classes provided by the Tailwind CSS framework.

## Entry points
The main entry points for this directory are the two React component files:

- `inline-styles.tsx`: This component defines the footer structure and styles it using inline styles.
- `tailwind.tsx`: This component defines the footer structure and styles it using Tailwind CSS classes.

Both components are wrapped in a `Layout` component, which is imported from a relative path and likely provides a consistent structure and styling for the application's components.

Developers can choose the appropriate component based on their preferred styling approach and integrate it into their email templates.
