## High-level description
This code defines a React component for a footer with a single column layout, typically used in email templates. It includes a logo, company name, tagline, social media links, address, and contact information. The footer is wrapped in a `Layout` component which provides basic HTML structure and styling.

## Code Structure
The code defines a functional React component that returns a JSX structure representing the footer. It uses various components from the `@react-email/components` library for layout and content. The `Layout` component is used to wrap the footer and provide basic HTML structure and styling.

## Symbols

### `component`
#### Description
This symbol is a React component that represents the structure and content of the footer. It uses a table to arrange the elements in a single column layout.

#### Inputs
This component does not accept any props.

#### Outputs
JSX structure representing the footer.

#### Internal Logic
The component uses a `&lt;table&gt;` element to create the single-column layout. Each `&lt;tr&gt;` element represents a row in the footer, and `&lt;td&gt;` elements are used for cells within each row. The content of the footer includes:
- An image logo.
- Company name and tagline.
- Social media icons with links.
- Address and contact information.

### `default`
#### Description
This is a default exported functional React component that renders the `component` within a `Layout` component.

#### Inputs

#### Outputs
JSX structure representing the footer wrapped in a layout.

#### Internal Logic
The component simply renders the `component` within the `&lt;Layout&gt;` component, passing the `component` as children.
