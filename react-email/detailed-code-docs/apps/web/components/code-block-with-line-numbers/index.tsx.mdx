## High-level description
This code defines a React component that renders a code block with line numbers using the `@react-email/components` library. The code block displays a JavaScript snippet demonstrating how to send an email using the `resend` library. This component is then wrapped in a `Layout` component for basic styling and structure.

## Code Structure
The code defines two symbols: `component` and a default export function component. The `component` is a React element that renders a `CodeBlock` with pre-defined code, language, line numbers, and theme. The default export function component renders the `component` within a `Layout` component.
