## High-level description
This directory contains two React components that render a header section for email templates. Both components display a logo on the left and social media icons on the right, but they use different styling approaches: one uses inline styles (`inline-styles.tsx`), while the other uses Tailwind CSS (`tailwind.tsx`).

## What does it do?
Both components render a header section suitable for an email template. The header includes a logo on the left side and icons for social media platforms (X, Instagram, and Facebook) on the right side. Clicking on the icons takes the user to the respective social media pages. The header is designed to be responsive and visually appealing within the context of an email client.
