## High-level description
This code defines a React component that renders a header section with a logo on the left and social media icons on the right. It is designed for use in email templates, utilizing the `@react-email/components` library.

## Code Structure
The code exports two symbols: `component` and a default function. The `component` is a React element representing the header structure with logo and social icons. The default function wraps this `component` within a `Layout` component, likely for consistent styling and structure across email templates.

## Symbols
### `component`
#### Description
This symbol is a React element representing the header section of an email template. It includes a logo on the left and social media icons (X, Instagram, Facebook) on the right.

#### Inputs
This symbol takes no inputs.

#### Outputs
This symbol returns a React element representing the header section.

#### Internal Logic
The component uses a `Section` to define the overall header area with padding. Inside, a `Row` is used for horizontal alignment of the logo and social icons.

- The logo is displayed using an `Img` component within a `Column` that takes up 80% of the row's width.
- The social icons are grouped within another `Column` on the right side. Each icon is an `Img` component wrapped in a `Link` component, placed within its own `Column` for spacing.

### `default` function
#### Description
This is a default exported function that renders the `component` within a `Layout` component.

#### Inputs
This function takes no inputs.

#### Outputs
This function returns a React element, which is the `component` wrapped in a `Layout` component.

#### Internal Logic
The function simply returns the `component` wrapped in a `Layout` component. This suggests that `Layout` provides a common structure and styling for email templates.

## References
- `Layout`: This symbol is referenced from `../_components/layout`, indicating a separate component responsible for the overall layout of the email template.
