## High-level description
This code defines a React component that renders a header section with the React Email logo on the left and social media icons (X, Instagram, Facebook) on the right. The header is wrapped in a `Layout` component for consistent styling.

## Code Structure
The code defines a functional React component that returns JSX code representing the header structure. It uses `Row` and `Column` components from `@react-email/components` for layout and `Img` and `Link` components for displaying images and links respectively. The header is wrapped in a `Layout` component.

## References
- `Layout`: A custom component imported from `../_components/layout`.

## Symbols

### `component`
#### Description
This symbol is a React component that renders the header content, including the React Email logo and social media icons.

#### Inputs
This component does not accept any props.

#### Outputs
JSX code representing the header structure.

#### Internal Logic
The component uses `Row` and `Column` components to arrange the logo and social media icons in a two-column layout. The `Img` component is used to display the logo and icons, and the `Link` component wraps each icon to make it clickable.

### `default` (anonymous function)
#### Description
This is a default exported anonymous function that renders the `component` within a `Layout` component.

#### Inputs
This function does not accept any arguments.

#### Outputs
JSX code representing the header wrapped in a `Layout` component.

#### Internal Logic
The function simply returns the `component` wrapped in a `&lt;Layout&gt;` component. This ensures consistent styling and structure for the header.
