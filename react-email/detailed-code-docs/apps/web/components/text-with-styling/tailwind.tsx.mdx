title: "tailwind.tsx"

## High-level description
This code defines a React component that renders two lines of text with specific styling using the `@react-email/components` library and Tailwind CSS. The first line is styled with larger font size, semi-bold weight, and indigo color, while the second line uses default styling. The component is then wrapped in a `Layout` component for consistent page structure.

## Code Structure
The code defines two symbols: `component` and a default exported arrow function. The `component` is a React fragment containing two `Text` components with different styling. The default exported function renders the `component` within a `Layout` component.

## Symbols
### `component`
#### Description
This symbol is a React fragment that renders two lines of text with distinct styling using the `Text` component from `@react-email/components` and Tailwind CSS classes.

#### Inputs
This symbol takes no inputs.

#### Outputs
This symbol returns a React fragment containing two styled `Text` components.

#### Internal Logic
- The first `Text` component renders "Amazing content" with the following styles:
    - `text-[24px]` sets the font size to 24 pixels.
    - `font-semibold` applies a semi-bold font weight.
    - `leading-[32px]` sets the line height to 32 pixels.
    - `text-indigo-400` sets the text color to indigo with a shade of 400.
- The second `Text` component renders "This is the actual content that the accented text above refers to." with default styling.

### Default exported arrow function
#### Description
This symbol is a React component that renders the `component` within a `Layout` component.

#### Inputs
This symbol takes no inputs.

#### Outputs
This symbol returns a React element representing the `Layout` component with the `component` rendered inside.

#### Internal Logic
- The function returns a `Layout` component with the `component` passed as children. This ensures the text content is rendered within the defined layout structure.
