## High-level description
This code defines a React component for a header with a centered menu, typically used in email templates. It includes a logo at the top and a single-row menu with links to "About", "Blog", "Company", and "Features". The header is wrapped in a `Layout` component for consistent styling.

## Code Structure
The code defines a React component as a constant `component` which is a `Section` containing a logo (`Img`) and a menu (`Row` of `Column`s containing `Link`s). This `component` is then used within the main functional component which wraps it in a `Layout` component.

## References
- `Layout`: This component is imported from `"../_components/layout"` and provides the overall structure and styling for the header.

## Symbols

### `component`
#### Description
This constant represents the main structure of the header, including the logo and the menu. It's a React component defined using JSX syntax.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props.

#### Outputs
React component representing the header structure.

#### Internal Logic
- A `Section` component defines the overall container for the header.
- A `Row` with a centered `Column` is used to display the logo.
- Another `Row` with a centered `Column` contains a `table` element.
- The `table` has a single row (`&lt;tr&gt;`) with four cells (`&lt;td&gt;`), each containing a `Link` component for the menu items.

### Default export (anonymous function)
#### Description
This anonymous function represents the main component that is exported and used to render the header.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props.

#### Outputs
React component representing the header wrapped in a `Layout` component.

#### Internal Logic
- It renders the `Layout` component and passes the `component` (defined earlier) as its child.

## Dependencies
- `@react-email/components`: This library provides the necessary components for building email-compatible layouts and elements like `Section`, `Row`, `Column`, `Link`, `Img`.
- `../_components/layout`: This local module provides the `Layout` component.
