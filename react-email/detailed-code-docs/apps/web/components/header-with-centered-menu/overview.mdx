## High-level description
This directory contains two React components for rendering a header with a centered menu: one styled with inline styles (`inline-styles.tsx`) and the other with Tailwind CSS (`tailwind.tsx`). Both components feature a logo at the top and a single-row menu with links to "About", "Blog", "Company", and "Features". They are typically used in email templates or web applications, respectively.

## What does it do?
This directory provides two different implementations of a header component, allowing developers to choose the styling approach that best suits their needs. Both components display a logo prominently at the top, followed by a horizontal menu with links to various sections of a website or email template. The inline-styles version directly embeds CSS rules within the component's code, while the Tailwind CSS version leverages utility classes for styling.

## Entry points
- `inline-styles.tsx`: Use this file for the inline-styled header component.
- `tailwind.tsx`: Use this file for the Tailwind CSS-styled header component.

Both components are structured similarly, exporting a default function that renders the header within a `Layout` component. The `Layout` component is assumed to be defined in a separate file and provides a consistent wrapper for the header content.

## Dependencies
Both header components depend on the `@react-email/components` library for layout and styling:

- `@react-email/components`: Provides components like `Section`, `Row`, `Column`, `Link`, and `Img` for building email-compatible layouts.

Additionally, the Tailwind CSS version implicitly relies on the Tailwind CSS framework for its utility-first styling approach.
