## High-level description
The code defines a React component that renders a section displaying four product cards in two rows. Each card features an image, product name, description, price, and a "Buy" button.

## Code Structure
The code defines a functional React component that returns a JSX structure. The structure is built using components from the `@react-email/components` library for creating email layouts. It uses `Section`, `Row`, `Column`, `Img`, `Text`, `Hr`, and `Button` components to structure the layout and content of the product cards. The `Layout` component is imported and used to wrap the main content.

## References
- `Layout`: A custom component imported from `../_components/layout`.

## Symbols

### `component`
#### Description
A React component that renders a section with four product cards arranged in two rows. Each card displays product information including an image, title, description, price, and a "Buy" button.

#### Inputs
This component does not accept any props.

#### Outputs
JSX structure representing a section with four product cards.

#### Internal Logic
The component uses a combination of `Section`, `Row`, and `Column` components to structure the layout. Each product card is wrapped in a `Column` component with a width of 50%. The `Img` component is used to display the product image, while `Text` components are used for the product title, description, and price. A `Button` component with a link to `https://react.email` is provided for purchasing. An `Hr` component acts as a visual separator between the two rows of cards.
