## High-level description
The `apps/web/components/title-four-cards` directory houses two React components designed to display a grid of four product cards. Both components achieve the same visual result, showcasing product information such as an image, title, description, price, and a "Buy" button. The key difference lies in their styling approach: `inline-styles.tsx` directly applies styles within the component, while `tailwind.tsx` leverages the Tailwind CSS framework for styling.

## What does it do?
This directory provides two reusable components for rendering a visually appealing product grid. Each component presents four product cards, arranged in two rows of two. Each card highlights key product details and includes a "Buy" button, aiming to entice users with product offerings.

## Key Files
| File | Description |
|---|---|
| `inline-styles.tsx` | This component defines the product grid structure and styling directly within the component's code using inline styles. It relies on the `@react-email/components` library for layout and elements. |
| `tailwind.tsx` | This component mirrors the structure of `inline-styles.tsx` but employs Tailwind CSS classes for styling. It also utilizes `@react-email/components` for layout and elements. |

## Dependencies
Both components share the following dependencies:

| Dependency | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `@react-email/components` | Provides React components specifically designed for building email-friendly layouts and elements. This ensures the product grid renders correctly across various email clients. |
| `../_components/layout` | Imports a custom `Layout` component, likely providing a consistent structure and basic styling to the page where the product grid is embedded. |
