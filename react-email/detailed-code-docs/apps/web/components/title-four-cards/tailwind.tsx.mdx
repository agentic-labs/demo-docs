## High-level description
The code defines a React component that displays a grid of four product cards, arranged in two rows of two. Each card features an image, title, description, price, and a "Buy" button. The component is wrapped in a layout component that provides basic styling and structure.

## Code Structure
The code defines a single component, `component`, which is a functional React component. It uses various components from the `@react-email/components` library to construct the layout and elements of the product cards. The `component` is then wrapped in a `Layout` component, also imported from a local file, which provides a basic HTML structure and styling.

## References
- `Layout`: A component imported from `../_components/layout` that provides the basic HTML structure and styling for the page.

## Symbols
### `component`
#### Description
This functional React component renders a grid of four product cards. Each card displays product information including an image, title, description, price, and a "Buy" button.

#### Inputs
This component does not accept any props.

#### Outputs
This component renders a React fragment (`&lt;&gt;&lt;/&gt;`) containing the grid of product cards.

#### Internal Logic
The component uses the `Row` and `Column` components from `@react-email/components` to create the grid layout. Each product card is wrapped in a `Column` component, and each row of cards is wrapped in a `Row` component. The `Img`, `Text`, and `Button` components are used to display the product image, information, and the "Buy" button respectively.
