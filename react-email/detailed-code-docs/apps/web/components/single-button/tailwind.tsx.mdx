## High-level description
This code defines a simple React component that renders a styled button with a link to the "react.email" website. It utilizes the `@react-email/components` library for email-specific rendering and styling. The button is wrapped in a layout component for basic page structure.

## Code Structure
The code defines two symbols: `component` and a default exported arrow function. The `component` is a React element representing the styled button. The default exported function renders the `component` within a `Layout` component.

## Symbols
### `component`
#### Description
This symbol is a React element representing a styled button. It uses the `BaseButton` component from `@react-email/components` and applies Tailwind CSS classes for styling. The button has a link to "https://react.email" and displays the text "Get started".

#### Inputs
This symbol does not take any inputs.

#### Outputs
This symbol renders a React element representing a styled button.

### `default` (exported arrow function)
#### Description
This symbol is a default exported arrow function that acts as a functional React component. It renders the `component` (the styled button) within a `Layout` component, providing basic page structure.

#### Inputs
This symbol does not take any inputs.

#### Outputs
This symbol renders a React fragment containing the `Layout` component with the `component` (styled button) nested inside.
