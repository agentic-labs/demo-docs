## High-level description
The `apps/web/components/single-button` directory houses two implementations of a styled "Get Started" button component for the React Email website. Both implementations use the `Button` component from the `@react-email/components` library but differ in their styling approaches: one uses inline styles (`inline-styles.tsx`), while the other utilizes Tailwind CSS (`tailwind.tsx`).

## What does it do?
This directory provides two options for rendering a visually consistent "Get Started" button across the React Email website. Developers can choose between inline styles or Tailwind CSS, depending on the project's styling preferences and setup. Both implementations ultimately render a button that links to the React Email homepage.

## Entry points
While there are only two files, they represent distinct implementations of the same component. Developers should choose the appropriate file based on their preferred styling method:

- `inline-styles.tsx`: Use this file for inline styling.
- `tailwind.tsx`: Use this file for styling with Tailwind CSS.

Both files export their respective button components as the default export, allowing for easy integration into other parts of the application.
