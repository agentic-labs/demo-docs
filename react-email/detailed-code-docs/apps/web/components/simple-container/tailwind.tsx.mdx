title: "tailwind.tsx"
---

## High-level description
This code defines a React component for a simple container element that uses Tailwind CSS for styling. It showcases how to use the `Container` and `Text` components from the `@react-email/components` library to create a basic email layout.

## Code Structure
The code exports two symbols: `component` and a default function component. The `component` is a React element representing a styled container with text. The default function component renders the `component` within a `Layout` component, likely providing a consistent structure across the application.

## References
- `Container`, `Text` from `@react-email/components`: Used for creating the container and text elements.
- `Layout` from `../_components/layout`: A custom component assumed to provide a layout structure.

## Symbols

### `component`

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSX.Element | React Element | A React element representing a container with text. |

#### Internal Logic
The component uses the `Container` component from `@react-email/components` to create a container with a gray background (`bg-[#93989C]`). Inside the container, it uses the `Text` component to display text with padding and white color.

### Default function component
#### Description
This is a default exported functional React component that renders the `component` within a `Layout` component.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSX.Element | React Element | A React element representing the layout with the container component. |

#### Internal Logic
The component simply renders the `component` within a `Layout` component, likely to ensure a consistent structure across different parts of the application.
