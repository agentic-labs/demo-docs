## High-level description
The `apps/web/components/simple-container` directory houses two React components designed to render a simple container element with text, primarily for use in email templates. Two implementations are provided, one using inline styles (`inline-styles.tsx`) and the other leveraging Tailwind CSS (`tailwind.tsx`). Both components share a similar structure, utilizing components from the `@react-email/components` library for email-specific styling and layout.

## What does it do?
This directory provides two ways to create a simple container with text, typically used in email templates. One uses inline styles directly within the component, while the other utilizes Tailwind CSS for styling. Both options offer a basic structure for displaying content within a visually separated container.

## Entry points
The primary entry points are `inline-styles.tsx` and `tailwind.tsx`, representing the two different styling implementations for the simple container component. Both files export a default function component that renders the final container element.

## Key Files

### apps/web/components/simple-container/inline-styles.tsx
This file defines a React component that renders a simple container with centered text content using inline styles. It utilizes the `Container` and `Text` components from the `@react-email/components` library for styling and layout.

### apps/web/components/simple-container/tailwind.tsx
This file defines a React component similar to `inline-styles.tsx`, but it employs Tailwind CSS for styling the container and text elements. It also uses the `Container` and `Text` components from the `@react-email/components` library.

## Dependencies
Both `inline-styles.tsx` and `tailwind.tsx` depend on the following:

- **@react-email/components:** This library provides React components specifically designed for building emails, including the `Container` and `Text` components used for layout and styling.
- **react:** The core React library.

`tailwind.tsx` additionally relies on Tailwind CSS for styling.
