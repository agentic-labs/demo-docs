## High-level description
The code defines a React component that renders a section with a heading, a descriptive paragraph, and three feature sections, each with an icon, a title, and a description. It utilizes the `@react-email/components` library for email-specific layout and styling.

## Code Structure
The code defines a single component as a constant variable `component`. This component is then wrapped in a `Layout` component which is assumed to provide basic HTML structure and styling.

## Symbols
