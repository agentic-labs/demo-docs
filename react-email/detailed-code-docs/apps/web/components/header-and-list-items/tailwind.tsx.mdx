## High-level description
This code defines a React component that renders a section with a header, a list of items, and horizontal rules as separators. Each item in the list consists of an icon, a title, and a short description. The component utilizes Tailwind CSS for styling and is wrapped in a layout component.

## Code Structure
The code defines a functional React component that returns JSX for rendering a section with a header and a list of items. The `Layout` component is used to wrap the content and provide basic styling. The `component` constant holds the JSX structure for the header and list items, which are then rendered within the `Layout` component.
