## High-level description
This directory provides two React components for rendering a single row with three equally sized columns in an email template. Both components achieve the same visual result but use different styling approaches: one uses inline styles (`inline-styles.tsx`) while the other leverages Tailwind CSS (`tailwind.tsx`).

## What does it do?
Both components in this directory render a single row divided into three equal columns. Each column has a distinct background color and displays simple text content. This structure is intended for use in email templates, providing a visually appealing way to present information in three distinct sections within a single row.

## Entry points
The main entry points are `inline-styles.tsx` and `tailwind.tsx`. Developers can choose which component to use based on their preferred styling approach. Both components are wrapped in a `Layout` component, suggesting a common structure for email components.

## Key Files
- **`inline-styles.tsx`**: This component defines the row and column structure using inline styles. It directly specifies the width, height, and background color of each column within the component's JSX.
- **`tailwind.tsx`**: This component achieves the same layout as `inline-styles.tsx` but uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling. This approach can lead to cleaner and more maintainable code, especially in larger projects.

## Dependencies
Both `inline-styles.tsx` and `tailwind.tsx` depend on the following:

- **`@react-email/components`**: This library provides JSX components specifically designed for building responsive emails. The `Row` and `Column` components from this library are used to create the three-column layout.
