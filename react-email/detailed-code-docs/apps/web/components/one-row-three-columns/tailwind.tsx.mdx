## High-level description
This code defines a React component that renders a row with three equally sized columns using the `@react-email/components` library. Each column has a distinct background color and displays a simple text label ("First", "Second", "Third"). The component is then wrapped in a `Layout` component for consistent styling.

## Code Structure
The code defines two symbols: `component` and a default exported arrow function. The `component` is a React element representing the row and columns structure. The default exported function renders the `component` within a `Layout` component.

## References
- `Layout`: A component imported from `../_components/layout`, likely providing a common layout structure for email components.

## Symbols

### `component`
#### Description
This symbol is a React element representing a row with three equally sized columns. Each column has a different background color and displays a text label.

#### Inputs
This symbol does not take any inputs.

#### Outputs
This symbol renders a `Row` component containing three `Column` components.

#### Internal Logic
The component uses the `Row` and `Column` components from the `@react-email/components` library to create the layout. Each `Column` is styled with Tailwind CSS classes to define its width, height, background color, and text alignment.

### Default Exported Function
#### Description
This unnamed arrow function acts as the main component, rendering the `component` within a `Layout` component.

#### Inputs
This function does not take any inputs.

#### Outputs
This function renders the `component` wrapped in a `Layout` component.

#### Internal Logic
The function simply returns the `component` wrapped in a `Layout` component. This suggests that `Layout` provides a common structure and styling for email components.
