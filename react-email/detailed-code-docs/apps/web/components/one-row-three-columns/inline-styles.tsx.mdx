## High-level description
This code defines a React component that renders a single row containing three equally sized columns using the `@react-email/components` library. Each column has a distinct background color and displays the text "1/3" centered within it.

## Code Structure
The code exports two symbols: `component` and a default function. The `component` is a React element representing the row and columns structure. The default function wraps this `component` within a `Layout` component imported from another file.

## References
- `Layout`: This component is imported from `../_components/layout.tsx` and provides a basic HTML email layout structure.

## Symbols

### `component`
#### Description
This symbol is a React element representing a row with three equally sized columns, each with a different background color.

#### Outputs
- Returns a `&lt;Row&gt;` element containing three `&lt;Column&gt;` elements.

#### Internal Logic
- Uses `@react-email/components` library to create a row (`&lt;Row&gt;`) and three columns (`&lt;Column&gt;`).
- Each column is set to 1/3 width, 40px height, and has a unique background color.
- The text "1/3" is centered within each column.

### `default` function
#### Description
This is a default exported function that renders the `component` within a `Layout` component.

#### Outputs
- Returns a React element with the `Layout` component wrapping the `component`.

#### Internal Logic
- Renders the `Layout` component imported from `../_components/layout.tsx`.
- Passes the `component` as children to the `Layout` component.
