## High-level description
The code defines a React component that renders a simple survey within an email. The survey asks users to rate their experience on a scale of 1 to 5 and provides clickable buttons for each rating.

## Code Structure
The code exports two symbols: `component` and a default function. The `component` is a React functional component that renders the survey content, including the heading, question, and rating buttons. The default function wraps the `component` within a `Layout` component, which provides basic email styling and structure.

## Symbols

### `component`
#### Description
This functional component renders the visual structure and content of the survey. It uses React Email components like `Section`, `Text`, `Heading`, `Row`, and `Column` to structure the layout and display text elements. It also uses the `Button` component to create clickable rating buttons.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props.

#### Outputs
Returns a React component representing the rendered survey.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Structure:** Uses `Section` to define the main container and sets its padding and text alignment.
2. **Heading and Question:** Displays the survey title ("Your opinion matters", "We want to hear you") using `Text` and `Heading` components with specific styling. It then presents the survey question ("How would you rate your experience...") using the `Text` component.
3. **Rating Buttons:** Generates an array of numbers from 1 to 5 and maps each number to a `Button` component. Each button represents a rating option and is styled with a border, rounded corners, and specific colors. The `href` attribute of the button is currently a placeholder and should be replaced with the actual URL that handles the selected rating.

### `default` (function)
#### Description
This is a default exported function that wraps the `component` within a `Layout` component.

#### Inputs
This function doesn't accept any arguments.

#### Outputs
Returns a React component representing the rendered survey wrapped in a layout.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Layout Wrapping:** Renders the `Layout` component and passes the `component` as its child. This applies basic email styling and structure to the survey component.

## Dependencies

| @react-email/components | Provides React components specifically designed for creating email templates. |

## TODOs
- Replace the placeholder `href` attribute in the `Button` component with the proper URL that saves the selected rating.
