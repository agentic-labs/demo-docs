## High-level description
This directory contains React components for rendering a customer satisfaction survey within an email. The survey asks users to rate their experience on a scale of 1 to 5 using clickable buttons. The directory includes two implementations: one using inline styles and another using Tailwind CSS for styling.

## What does it do?
The components in this directory create a simple, visually appealing survey that can be embedded in an email. The survey presents a question asking users to rate their experience, followed by five buttons representing ratings from 1 to 5. When a user clicks on a rating button, it should (in theory) record their response, although the actual submission logic is not implemented in these components.

The survey is designed to be easily readable and interactive within an email client, making it convenient for recipients to provide quick feedback without leaving their email interface.

## Key Files
1. `inline-styles.tsx`: This file contains a React component that renders the survey using inline styles for layout and appearance.

2. `tailwind.tsx`: This file contains a React component that renders the survey using Tailwind CSS classes for styling.

Both files export a `component` that represents the survey content and a default function that wraps the survey in a `Layout` component for proper email structure.

## Dependencies
The components in this directory rely on the following external libraries:

1. @react-email/components (version not specified)
   - Purpose: Provides React components specifically designed for creating email templates, such as `Button`, `Column`, `Heading`, `Row`, `Section`, and `Text`.
   - Chosen for its specialized components that ensure compatibility with various email clients.

2. Tailwind CSS (used in `tailwind.tsx`)
   - Purpose: Provides utility classes for styling the survey components.
   - Chosen for its flexibility and ease of use in creating responsive designs.

## Configuration
While there are no specific configuration files in this directory, it's worth noting that the survey components have some configurable aspects:

1. Survey question: The text of the survey question can be easily modified within the component.
2. Rating scale: The current implementation uses a 1-5 scale, but this could be adjusted by modifying the array used in the `map` function.
3. Button styling: The appearance of the rating buttons can be customized either through inline styles or Tailwind classes, depending on the implementation.

## Code Examples

Here's a snippet from the `inline-styles.tsx` file showing how the rating buttons are generated:

```jsx
{[1, 2, 3, 4, 5].map((rating) =&gt; (
  &lt;Column key={rating}&gt;
    &lt;Button
      href="#"
      style={{
        backgroundColor: '#ffffff',
        borderRadius: '5px',
        color: '#000000',
        fontSize: '16px',
        fontWeight: 'bold',
        textDecoration: 'none',
        textAlign: 'center' as const,
        display: 'block',
        width: '100%',
        border: '1px solid #cccccc',
      }}
    &gt;
      {rating}
    &lt;/Button&gt;
  &lt;/Column&gt;
))}
```

And here's the equivalent code from the `tailwind.tsx` file:

```jsx
{[1, 2, 3, 4, 5].map((rating) =&gt; (
  &lt;Column key={rating} className="px-1"&gt;
    &lt;Button
      href="#"
      className="block w-full py-4 text-base font-semibold text-center text-black bg-white border border-gray-300 rounded"
    &gt;
      {rating}
    &lt;/Button&gt;
  &lt;/Column&gt;
))}
```

These examples demonstrate the different styling approaches used in each implementation while achieving the same visual result.

## TODOs
Both implementations have a common TODO item:

- Replace the placeholder `href="#"` attribute in the `Button` components with the proper URL that saves the selected rating. This will require implementing a backend service to handle the survey responses and generating unique URLs for each survey recipient.

Implementing this TODO will make the survey fully functional, allowing it to collect and store user responses when the rating buttons are clicked.
