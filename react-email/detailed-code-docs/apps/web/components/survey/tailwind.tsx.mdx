## High-level description
The code defines a React component that renders a simple customer satisfaction survey. Users are asked to rate their experience on a scale of 1 to 5, with each rating represented by a button. 

The component is wrapped in a `Layout` component which provides basic HTML structure and styling using Tailwind CSS.

## Code Structure
The code defines two symbols: `component` and a default export function. The `component` is a functional React component that renders the survey content. The default export function renders the `component` within a `Layout` component.

## Symbols

### `component`
#### Description
This functional React component renders the survey content, including the heading, question, and rating buttons.

#### Inputs
This component does not accept any props.

#### Outputs
This component renders a React fragment containing the survey elements.

#### Internal Logic
The component uses the `map` function to iterate over an array of numbers (1-5) and render a button for each rating. Each button's label is the corresponding number.

### `default export function`
#### Description
This function renders the `component` within a `Layout` component, providing basic HTML structure and styling.

#### Inputs
This function does not accept any arguments.

#### Outputs
This function returns a React fragment containing the `Layout` component with the `component` rendered inside.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @react-email/components | Provides React components specifically designed for email rendering, such as `Button`, `Column`, `Heading`, `Row`, `Section`, and `Text`. |
| ../_components/layout | Provides a custom `Layout` component for basic HTML structure and styling. |

## TODOs
- The `href` attribute of the buttons is currently a placeholder. It should be replaced with the proper URL that saves the selected rating.
