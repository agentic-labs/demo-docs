## High-level description
This code defines a React component that renders an abandoned cart email. It displays a table with the abandoned items, their quantity, and price, and includes a call to action button to encourage the user to complete their purchase.

## Code Structure
The code exports two symbols: `component` and a default unnamed function. The `component` is a React functional component that renders the actual content of the email. The default function acts as a wrapper, using the `Layout` component to provide basic styling and structure to the email.

## Symbols
### `component`
#### Description
This React functional component renders the content of the abandoned cart email. It includes a heading, a table displaying the abandoned items, and a call to action button.

#### Inputs
This component does not accept any explicit inputs.

#### Outputs
This component returns a React fragment containing the rendered HTML for the abandoned cart email.

#### Internal Logic
The component renders a `Section` containing:
- A `Heading` with the text "You left something in your cart".
- Another `Section` containing:
    - A `table` displaying the abandoned items. Each row represents an item with its image, name, quantity, and price.
    - A `Row` containing a `Column` with a `Button` labeled "Checkout" that links to `https://react.email`.

### `default` (unnamed function)
#### Description
This unnamed function acts as a wrapper for the `component`. It uses the `Layout` component to provide basic styling and structure to the email.

#### Inputs
This function does not accept any explicit inputs.

#### Outputs
This function returns the rendered `Layout` component, which wraps the `component`.
