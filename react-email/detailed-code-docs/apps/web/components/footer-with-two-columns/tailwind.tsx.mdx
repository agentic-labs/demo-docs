## High-level description
This code defines a React component for a two-column footer section, typically used in marketing emails. It includes the company logo, name, tagline, social media links, address, and contact information. The component is wrapped in a layout component for consistent styling.

## Code Structure
The `component` constant defines the structure and content of the footer. It utilizes `Row` and `Column` components from `@react-email/components` to arrange elements in a two-column layout. The first column houses the company branding, while the second column contains social media links, address, and contact details. The `export default` statement defines a functional component that renders the `component` within a `Layout` component.

## References
- `Layout` component from `../_components/layout`
