## High-level description
This code defines a React component for a two-column footer section, typically used in email templates. It includes the company logo, name, tagline, social media links, address, and contact information. The footer is wrapped in a `Layout` component for consistent styling.

## Code Structure
The code defines a single React component as a constant `component` which represents the entire footer structure. It utilizes various components from the `@react-email/components` library to construct the layout and content of the footer. The `component` is then used within a default exported arrow function component which wraps it in a `Layout` component.

## References
- `Layout`: A custom component likely providing basic layout and styling for the email template.

## Symbols

### `component`
#### Description
This constant represents the main structure of the two-column footer. It uses a grid system (`Row`, `Column`) to arrange the content into two columns. The left column contains the company branding (logo, name, tagline) and the right column contains social media links, address, and contact information.

#### Inputs
This is a constant, it does not take any inputs.

#### Outputs
This constant is a React component representing the footer structure.

#### Internal Logic
The component uses nested `Row` and `Column` components to create the two-column layout. It utilizes `Img` components for displaying images (logo and social media icons), `Text` components for textual content, and `Link` components for creating clickable links for social media profiles. Inline styles are heavily used to customize the appearance of elements.
