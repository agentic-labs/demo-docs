## High-level description
This directory contains two implementations of a React component for a two-column footer, one using inline styles (`inline-styles.tsx`) and the other using Tailwind CSS (`tailwind.tsx`). Both implementations provide the same basic functionality: displaying company branding, social media links, address, and contact information in a two-column layout typically used in email templates.

## What does it do?
Both components render a footer section divided into two columns. 

The left column typically displays:
- Company logo
- Company name
- Tagline

The right column typically displays:
- Social media links (icons and links to profiles)
- Company address
- Contact information (e.g., email, phone number)

The components use a grid system (`Row`, `Column`) from the `@react-email/components` library to structure the layout. They also utilize other components from this library for displaying images (`Img`), text (`Text`), and links (`Link`).

## Entry points
- `inline-styles.tsx`: This file contains the footer component implementation using inline styles for styling.
- `tailwind.tsx`: This file contains the footer component implementation using Tailwind CSS for styling.

Developers can choose the implementation that best suits their project's styling approach. Both files export the footer component as the default export.
