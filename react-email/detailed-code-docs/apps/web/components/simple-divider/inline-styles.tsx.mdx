## High-level description
This code defines a React component that renders a simple horizontal divider with text above and below it. The divider is styled using inline styles and is wrapped in a layout component.

## Code Structure
The code exports two symbols: `component` and a default function. The `component` is a React fragment that contains the text elements and the styled `Hr` component. The default function acts as a wrapper, rendering the `component` within a `Layout` component.

## Symbols

### `component`
#### Description
This symbol is a React fragment that renders a simple horizontal divider with the text "Before divider" above it and "After divider" below it. The divider is implemented using the `Hr` component from the `@react-email/components` library and is styled using inline styles.

#### Inputs
This symbol does not accept any inputs.

#### Outputs
This symbol renders a React fragment containing the following:
- A `Text` component displaying "Before divider".
- An `Hr` component styled as a horizontal divider.
- A `Text` component displaying "After divider".

#### Internal Logic
The `Hr` component is styled with a top margin and bottom margin of 16, a border color of "#cccccc", and a border top width of 2.

### `default` function
#### Description
This is a default exported function that renders the `component` within a `Layout` component.

#### Inputs
This function does not accept any inputs.

#### Outputs
This function renders the `Layout` component with the `component` as its children.
