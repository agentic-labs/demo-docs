title: "tailwind.tsx"

## High-level description
This code defines a simple horizontal divider component for use in React email templates. It utilizes the `@react-email/components` library for rendering email-safe components and Tailwind CSS for styling. The component displays a horizontal rule with text above and below.

## Code Structure
The code defines two main symbols: `component` and the default export. The `component` is a React fragment that renders the actual divider elements. The default export is a functional component that wraps the `component` within a `Layout` component, presumably for consistent page structure.

## Symbols
### `component`
#### Description
This symbol is a React fragment that renders the visual representation of the simple divider. It includes text elements for "Before divider" and "After divider" and a horizontal rule styled with Tailwind CSS classes.

#### Inputs
This symbol does not accept any inputs.

#### Outputs
This symbol returns a React fragment containing the rendered HTML elements for the divider.

#### Internal Logic
The fragment renders three elements:
1. A `&lt;Text&gt;` component displaying "Before divider".
2. An `&lt;Hr&gt;` (horizontal rule) component with Tailwind CSS classes for styling.
3. A `&lt;Text&gt;` component displaying "After divider".

### `default` (export)
#### Description
This is the default exported function component that represents the Simple Divider component. It renders the `component` within a `Layout` component.

#### Inputs
This symbol does not accept any inputs.

#### Outputs
This symbol returns a React element representing the Simple Divider component wrapped in a `Layout`.

#### Internal Logic
The function returns a JSX expression that renders the `Layout` component with the `component` as its child.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `@react-email/components` | Provides email-safe React components like `Hr`, `Text`, `Layout`. |

## References
- `Layout`: This symbol is referenced in the default export and is likely defined in another file (`../_components/layout.tsx`). It presumably provides a consistent layout structure for email templates.
