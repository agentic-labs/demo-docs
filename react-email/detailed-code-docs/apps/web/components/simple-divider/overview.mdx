## High-level description
The `apps/web/components/simple-divider` directory houses two implementations of a simple horizontal divider component for use in React email templates. Both implementations provide the same visual output: a horizontal rule with customizable text above and below. The key difference lies in their styling approach: one uses inline styles (`inline-styles.tsx`), while the other leverages Tailwind CSS (`tailwind.tsx`).

## What does it do?
This directory provides two options for developers to include a simple horizontal divider in their React email templates. Both components render a horizontal line with text above and below it. The text content is currently hardcoded to "Before divider" and "After divider" but can be easily customized.

## Entry points
Developers can choose between `inline-styles.tsx` for inline styling or `tailwind.tsx` for styling with Tailwind CSS. Both files export a default function that renders the divider component wrapped in a `Layout` component.

## Key Files
- **`inline-styles.tsx`**: This file defines the divider component with inline styles applied directly to the elements.
- **`tailwind.tsx`**: This file defines the divider component using Tailwind CSS classes for styling.

## Dependencies
Both implementations depend on the `@react-email/components` library for rendering email-safe components like `Hr` (horizontal rule) and `Text`. They also utilize a `Layout` component, likely defined in `../_components/layout.tsx`, to ensure consistent page structure across email templates.
