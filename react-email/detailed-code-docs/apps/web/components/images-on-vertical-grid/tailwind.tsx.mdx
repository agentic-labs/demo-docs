## High-level description
This code defines a React component that renders a section with images arranged on a vertical grid layout. It showcases a collection of ceramic mugs with descriptions and links to product pages. The component is wrapped in a layout component for consistent styling.

## Code Structure
The code defines two components: `component` and an unnamed default export component. The `component` renders the image grid structure with text descriptions and links using components from the `@react-email/components` library. The default export component simply wraps the `component` within a `Layout` component.

## Symbols
### `component`
#### Description

#### Internal Logic
The component first renders a section with a heading "Ceramic Mugs" and a brief description. It then renders another section containing an image grid. The grid consists of a hero image linked to a product page and two smaller images arranged side-by-side, each linked to their respective pages.

### `default export` (unnamed)
#### Description
This is the default export of the module. It renders the `component` within a `Layout` component, providing a consistent layout and styling.

#### Inputs
