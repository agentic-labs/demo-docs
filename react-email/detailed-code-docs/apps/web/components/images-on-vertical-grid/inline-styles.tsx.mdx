## High-level description
The code defines a React component that renders a section displaying drinkware, specifically ceramic mugs, with images and descriptive text in a vertical grid layout. It utilizes components from the `@react-email/components` library for structuring the email content.

## Code Structure
The code exports a default function component that renders a `Layout` component, which wraps the main content (`component`). The `component` itself is a functional component that defines the structure and content of the email section. It uses `Section`, `Row`, `Column`, `Text`, `Link`, and `Img` components from the `@react-email/components` library to build the layout and display text, images, and links.

## References
- `@react-email/components`: This library provides the building blocks for creating email layouts and content, including `Section`, `Row`, `Column`, `Text`, `Link`, and `Img` components.
- `Layout`: This component, defined in a separate file, likely provides a common wrapper for email content, potentially handling styling and structure.

## Symbols

### `component`
#### Description
This functional component defines the structure and content of the email section showcasing drinkware. It utilizes components from `@react-email/components` to create a visually appealing layout with images, text, and links.

#### Inputs
This component does not accept any explicit input parameters.

#### Outputs
This component returns JSX that represents the rendered HTML structure of the email section.

#### Internal Logic
The component structures the content within a `Section` element. 
- It first displays a heading "Drinkware" and a subheading "Ceramic Mugs" using the `Text` component with specific styling for font size, weight, and color. 
- A short paragraph of text describes the mugs and their features. 
- An image of the "Mugs Collection" is displayed with a link. 
- Two more images, "Monty Art Cup - 1" and "Monty Art Cup - 2", are displayed side-by-side in a two-column layout, each wrapped in a link.

### `default` (anonymous function)
#### Description
This anonymous function serves as the default export of the module. It renders the `Layout` component, passing the `component` as its child.

#### Inputs
This component does not accept any explicit input parameters.

#### Outputs
This component returns JSX that represents the rendered HTML structure of the email section wrapped within the `Layout` component.
