## High-level description
This code defines a React component that renders a header section with a side menu. The header includes the React Email logo on the left and navigation links on the right.

## Code Structure
The code defines a functional React component that returns a `Section` element containing the header structure. The header is laid out using `Row` and `Column` components from the `@react-email/components` library. The logo is displayed using the `Img` component, and the navigation links are rendered as `Link` components within a nested `Row` structure. The component is then wrapped in a `Layout` component.

## References
- `Layout`: This symbol is imported from a local file and is used to wrap the header component, likely providing common layout elements.
