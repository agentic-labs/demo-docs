## High-level description
The code defines a React component that renders a header section with a logo and navigation links, typically used for a website or web application. It utilizes the `@react-email/components` library for layout and styling, and is designed to be embedded within a `Layout` component.

## Code Structure
The code defines a single component as a constant `component`. This component is then used within a default exported arrow function component which renders it within a `Layout` component.

## Symbols

### `component`
#### Description
This component represents the header section of a webpage. It includes a logo on the left and navigation links on the right.

#### Inputs
This component does not accept any props.

#### Outputs
This component renders a `Section` component containing the header structure.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Structure:** The component uses a `Section` for the overall container, a `Row` to position the logo and links horizontally, and `Column` components for vertical alignment and spacing.
2. **Logo:** An `Img` component displays the logo, sourced from "/static/logo-without-background.png".
3. **Navigation Links:** Three `Link` components are used for "About", "Company", and "Blog" links. They are styled to appear as simple text links.

### `default` (anonymous exported function)
#### Description
This is a default exported arrow function component that serves as an entry point for using the header component.

#### Inputs
This component does not accept any props.

#### Outputs
This component renders the `component` (header) wrapped within a `Layout` component.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `@react-email/components` | Provides layout components like `Column`, `Link`, `Img`, `Row`, and `Section` for building the header structure. |
| `../_components/layout` | Imports the `Layout` component, likely providing a consistent wrapper for page content. |
