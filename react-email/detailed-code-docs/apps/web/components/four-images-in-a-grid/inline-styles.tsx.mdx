title: "inline-styles.tsx"

## High-level description
This code defines a React component that renders a section with a heading, a paragraph of text, and a 2x2 grid of images. Each image is wrapped in a link and has a caption. The component is designed to be responsive and uses inline styles for layout and appearance.

## Code Structure
The code defines a single component as a constant `component`. This component is then used within a default export, which wraps it in a `Layout` component. The `component` itself is structured using a series of nested `Section`, `Row`, `Column`, `Text`, `Link`, and `Img` components from the `@react-email/components` library.

## Symbols

### `component`
#### Description
This component renders a section with a heading, a paragraph of text, and a 2x2 grid of images. Each image is wrapped in a link.

#### Inputs
This component does not accept any props.

#### Outputs
This component renders a React element representing the described section.

#### Internal Logic
The component uses a series of nested `Section`, `Row`, `Column`, `Text`, `Link`, and `Img` components to structure the content. Each image is wrapped in a `Link` component and has alt text specified. The layout is achieved using inline styles that define margins, padding, widths, and other visual properties.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `@react-email/components` | Provides the basic building blocks for creating email-compatible React components, such as `Section`, `Row`, `Column`, `Text`, `Link`, and `Img`. |
| `../_components/layout` | Provides a `Layout` component that wraps the content and likely handles common layout elements and styles. |
