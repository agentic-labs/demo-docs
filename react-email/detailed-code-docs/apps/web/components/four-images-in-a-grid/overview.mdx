## High-level description
The `apps/web/components/four-images-in-a-grid` directory houses two React components designed to display a section with a heading, a description, and a 2x2 grid of images within an email. Each image is wrapped in a link. The two components offer different styling approaches: one uses inline styles (`inline-styles.tsx`), while the other leverages Tailwind CSS (`tailwind.tsx`).

## What does it do?
This directory provides reusable components for rendering a visually appealing grid of four images within an email template. Each component takes care of structuring the layout, including the heading, description, and the grid itself. The images are clickable links, allowing the recipient to interact with the content.

## Entry points
Developers can choose between `inline-styles.tsx` and `tailwind.tsx` based on their preferred styling approach. Both components offer the same basic functionality but differ in how they handle styling.

- `inline-styles.tsx`: This component directly embeds styling information within the JSX structure using inline styles. This approach can be suitable for smaller components or when specific, fine-grained control over styles is required.

- `tailwind.tsx`: This component utilizes Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework, to apply pre-defined CSS classes for styling. This approach can lead to cleaner and more maintainable code, especially for larger projects.

## Dependencies
Both components share the following dependency:

- `@react-email/components`: This library provides JSX components specifically designed for email rendering, ensuring compatibility and responsiveness across different email clients. It offers elements like `Section`, `Row`, `Column`, `Text`, `Link`, and `Img` used to structure the layout and content.

Additionally, both components rely on a `Layout` component imported from `../_components/layout`. This component likely provides a common layout structure for email templates and might handle common styling aspects.
