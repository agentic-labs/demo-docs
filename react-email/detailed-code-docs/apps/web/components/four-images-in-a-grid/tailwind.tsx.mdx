## High-level description
This React component renders a section with a heading, description, and a 2x2 grid of images, each wrapped in a link. It utilizes the `@react-email/components` library for structuring the layout and elements specifically for emails.

## Code Structure
The code defines a functional component that returns JSX for rendering the image grid section. It uses `Section`, `Row`, `Column`, `Text`, `Link`, and `Img` components from `@react-email/components` to structure the layout and content. The `Layout` component, imported from another file, is used to wrap the main content and potentially apply Tailwind CSS styles.

## Symbols

### `component`
#### Description
This symbol is a React component that renders a section with a heading, description, and a 2x2 grid of images. Each image is wrapped in a link.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props.

#### Outputs
Returns JSX that renders the following structure:
- A `Section` containing:
    - Another `Section` with heading and description text.
    - Another `Section` with two `Row` elements, each containing two `Column` elements. Each `Column` holds a `Link` wrapping an `Img` component.

#### Internal Logic
The component uses nested `Row` and `Column` components to achieve the 2x2 grid layout. Each `Img` component has its source (`src`) and alternative text (`alt`) attributes defined.

### `default` (anonymous function)
#### Description
This is a default exported anonymous function that acts as a wrapper for the `component` symbol.

#### Inputs
This function doesn't accept any arguments.

#### Outputs
Returns JSX that renders the `component` wrapped in a `Layout` component.

#### Internal Logic
The function simply calls the `Layout` component, passing the `component` as its children.
