## High-level description
This component renders a simple text with an inline link to the React Email website. It is wrapped in a layout component for basic styling.

## Code Structure
The code defines two symbols: `component` and a default exported arrow function. The `component` is a React element that represents the actual content - a text with an inline link. The default exported function acts as a wrapper, rendering the `component` within a `Layout` component.

## Symbols
### `component`
#### Description
This symbol is a React element that renders a simple text "This is React Email" with "React Email" being a hyperlink to `https://react.email`.

#### Inputs
This symbol takes no inputs.

#### Outputs
This symbol returns a React element:
```jsx
&lt;Text&gt;
  This is &lt;Link href="https://react.email"&gt;React Email&lt;/Link&gt;
&lt;/Text&gt;
```

#### Internal Logic
This symbol uses the `Text` and `Link` components from the `@react-email/components` library to construct the output.

### `default` (exported arrow function)
#### Description
This is a default exported arrow function that serves as a wrapper for the `component`. It renders the `component` within a `Layout` component.

#### Inputs
This symbol takes no inputs.

#### Outputs
This symbol returns a React element:
```jsx
&lt;Layout&gt;{component}&lt;/Layout&gt;
```

#### Internal Logic
This symbol simply renders the `component` within a `Layout` component, which is imported from `../_components/layout`.
