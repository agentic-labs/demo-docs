## High-level description
This code defines a React component that renders two download buttons for an app, one for Google Play and one for the App Store. The buttons are styled to be inline and are displayed within a layout component.

## Code Structure
The code exports two symbols: `component` and a default function. The `component` is a React element that defines the structure and styling of the download buttons. The default function wraps the `component` within a `Layout` component.

## Symbols

### `component`
#### Description
This symbol is a React element that defines the structure and styling of the download buttons. It uses `Row` and `Column` components from the `@react-email/components` library to arrange the buttons in a two-column layout. Each button is an `Img` component wrapped in a `Button` component, linking to the respective app store.

#### Inputs
This symbol does not take any inputs.

#### Outputs
This symbol renders a React element representing the download buttons.

#### Internal Logic
The component uses a table to arrange the buttons in a row with padding between them. Each button is an image with an alt text and a link to the app store.

### `default` (function)
#### Description
This is a default exported function that renders the `component` within a `Layout` component.

#### Inputs
This function does not take any inputs.

#### Outputs
This function renders a React element representing the download buttons within a layout.
