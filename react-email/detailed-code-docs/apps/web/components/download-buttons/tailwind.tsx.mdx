## High-level description
This code defines a React component that renders two download buttons for an app, one for Google Play and one for the App Store. The buttons are styled and laid out using the `@react-email/components` library and Tailwind CSS. The component is wrapped in a `Layout` component which provides basic HTML structure and styling.

## Code Structure
The code exports two symbols: `component` and a default function. The `component` is a React element that defines the structure and content of the download buttons section. The default function acts as a wrapper that renders the `component` within a `Layout` component.

## Symbols

### `component`
#### Description
This symbol is a React element that represents the download buttons section of a webpage. It uses `Row` and `Column` components from `@react-email/components` for layout and `Button` and `Img` components for the buttons themselves.

#### Inputs
This symbol doesn't take any inputs.

#### Outputs
This symbol returns a React element representing the download buttons section.

#### Internal Logic
The component arranges two buttons side by side within a table structure. Each button is a link (`&lt;Button&gt;`) containing an image (`&lt;Img&gt;`) that represents the respective app store's download button. The text above the buttons encourages users to try the app.

### `default` (function)
#### Description
This is a default exported function that serves as an entry point for rendering the download buttons component. It wraps the `component` within a `Layout` component to provide basic HTML structure and styling.

#### Inputs
This function doesn't take any inputs.

#### Outputs
This function returns a React element representing the download buttons section wrapped in a `Layout` component.

#### Internal Logic
The function simply renders the `Layout` component and passes the `component` as its children.
