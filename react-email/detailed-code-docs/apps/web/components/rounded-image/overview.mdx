## High-level description
This directory contains React components for rendering a rounded image of a Stagg Electric Kettle. Two versions of the component are provided: one using inline styles (`inline-styles.tsx`) and another using Tailwind CSS (`tailwind.tsx`). Both versions are designed for use in email templates, leveraging the `@react-email` library for email-specific rendering.

## What does it do?
Both components display a rounded image of a Stagg Electric Kettle. They fetch the image from a local static file and apply styling to give it rounded corners. The key difference lies in how they handle styling: one uses inline styles directly within the component, while the other leverages Tailwind CSS classes for a more maintainable and scalable approach. 

The components are wrapped within a `Layout` component, suggesting they are intended to be part of a larger email template structure.
