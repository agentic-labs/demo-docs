## High-level description
This code defines a React component that renders a rounded image of a Stagg Electric Kettle within a layout structure suitable for an email. It utilizes the `@react-email` library for email-specific rendering and styling.

## Code Structure
The code exports two symbols: `component` and a default function. The `component` is a React element representing the rounded image itself. The default function wraps this `component` within a `Layout` component, likely for consistent email structure and styling.

## Symbols

### `component`
#### Description
This symbol is a React element representing a rounded image of a Stagg Electric Kettle. It uses the `Img` component from the `@react-email` library for rendering images in emails.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSX.Element | `React.ReactElement` | A React element representing a rounded image. |

#### Internal Logic
The `Img` component is configured with:
- `alt`: Set to "Stagg Electric Kettle" for accessibility.
- `height`: Set to 250 pixels.
- `src`: Points to the image file "/static/stagg-eletric-kettle.jpg".
- `style`: Applies inline styles for border radius (12px) and margin (auto) to center the image horizontally.

### `default` function
#### Description
This is a default exported function that returns a React element. It wraps the `component` (rounded image) within a `Layout` component, likely providing a consistent structure and styling for emails.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSX.Element | `React.ReactElement` | A React element representing the rounded image within a layout structure. |
