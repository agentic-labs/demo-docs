title: "tailwind.tsx"

## High-level description
This code defines a React component that displays a rounded image of a Stagg electric kettle within a layout. The image is sourced from a local static file and is styled using Tailwind CSS.

## Code Structure
The code exports two symbols: `component` and a default function. The `component` is a React element representing the rounded image. The default function wraps this `component` within a `Layout` component imported from another file.

## References
- `Layout`: Imported from `../_components/layout.tsx`, provides a basic HTML structure and styling for the component.

## Symbols
### `component`
#### Description
This symbol is a React element representing a rounded image of a Stagg electric kettle. It uses the `Img` component from the `@react-email/components` library.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSX.Element | `React.ReactElement` | A React element representing the rounded image. |

#### Internal Logic
The `Img` component is configured with the following props:
- `alt`: Sets the alternative text for the image for accessibility.
- `className`: Applies Tailwind CSS classes for styling the image with rounded corners and centering.
- `height`: Sets the height of the image to 250 pixels.
- `src`: Specifies the source URL of the image, which is a local static file.

### `default` function
#### Description
This is a default exported function that returns the `component` wrapped within a `Layout` component.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSX.Element | `React.ReactElement` | A React element representing the rounded image within a layout. |

#### Internal Logic
The function returns the `component` wrapped within a `&lt;Layout&gt;` component. This suggests that the `Layout` component provides some common structure or styling for the application.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @react-email/components | Provides React components specifically designed for email rendering, including the `Img` component used for displaying the image. |
| ../_components/layout | Provides a custom `Layout` component that likely defines the basic structure and styling for the application. |
