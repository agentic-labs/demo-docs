## High-level description
This code defines a React component that renders a three-column layout with images and text, specifically designed for use in emails. It utilizes the `@react-email/components` library for email-safe rendering and Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Code Structure
The code defines two components: `component` and a default export. The `component` is a functional component that renders the actual three-column layout with images and text. The default export is another functional component that wraps the `component` within a `Layout` component, presumably for consistent styling and structure across different email components.

## References
- `Layout`: A component imported from `../_components/layout`, likely providing a common layout structure for email components.

## Symbols

### `component`
#### Description
This functional component renders a three-column layout with images and text. It uses `Section`, `Row`, `Column`, `Text`, `Link`, and `Img` components from the `@react-email/components` library to structure the layout and display content.

#### Inputs
This component does not accept any props.

#### Outputs
This component returns a JSX structure representing a three-column layout with images and text.

#### Internal Logic
The component first renders a section with a heading "Elegant Style" and a paragraph of text. Then, it renders another section with three columns, each containing an image wrapped in a link. The images are sourced from local static files.

### Default Export
#### Description
This unnamed functional component serves as the entry point for this module. It renders the `component` within a `Layout` component.

#### Inputs
This component does not accept any props.

#### Outputs
This component returns a JSX structure representing the `component` wrapped in a `Layout` component.
