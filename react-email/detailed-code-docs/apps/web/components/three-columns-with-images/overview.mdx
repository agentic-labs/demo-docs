## High-level description
The `apps/web/components/three-columns-with-images` directory houses two React components designed to render a three-column layout with images and text, specifically for use in email templates. 

It offers two implementations of the same visual structure:
- `inline-styles.tsx`: Uses inline styles for email compatibility.
- `tailwind.tsx`: Leverages Tailwind CSS for styling.

## What does it do?
Both components present a visually consistent layout suitable for showcasing products or services within an email. They display a header section with a title and description, followed by a row of three columns, each featuring an image and potentially a link.

## Entry points
- `inline-styles.tsx`: Renders the layout using inline styles directly within the component.
- `tailwind.tsx`: Utilizes Tailwind CSS classes for styling the layout.

Both files export the component as a default export, making it readily importable and usable in other parts of the application.

## Dependencies
Both components rely on the `@react-email/components` library:

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `@react-email/components` | Provides email-safe HTML elements and styling. |

This library ensures that the generated HTML and CSS are compatible with various email clients.
