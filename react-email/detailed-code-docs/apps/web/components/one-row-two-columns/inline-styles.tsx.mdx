## High-level description
This code defines a React component that renders two rows of colored columns within a layout structure suitable for emails. The first row demonstrates a 50/50 split while the second row showcases a 33.3333/66.6666 split.

## Code Structure
The code exports two symbols: `component` and a default unnamed function. The `component` is a React fragment that defines the layout of the two rows with their respective columns. The default function acts as a wrapper, placing the `component` within a `Layout` component imported from another file.

## References
- `Layout`: Imported from `../_components/layout.tsx`, provides a basic HTML email structure with optional Tailwind CSS support.

## Symbols

### `component`
#### Description
This symbol is a React fragment that defines the structure and styling of two rows of columns. Each row demonstrates different width proportions for its columns.

#### Inputs
This symbol takes no inputs.

#### Outputs
This symbol returns a React fragment containing two `Row` components, each with styled `Column` components nested inside.

#### Internal Logic
The `component` uses the `Row` and `Column` components from the `@react-email/components` library to create the layout. Each `Column` is styled with inline styles to define its width, height, and background color.

### Default function (`export default () =&gt; { ... }`)
#### Description
This unnamed function acts as a wrapper for the `component` symbol. It renders the `component` within a `Layout` component, providing a basic HTML email structure.

#### Inputs
This function takes no inputs.

#### Outputs
This function returns a React element, which is the `Layout` component with the `component` rendered inside.

#### Internal Logic
The function simply returns the `Layout` component and passes the `component` as its children. This ensures the layout structure is applied to the rows and columns defined in the `component`.
