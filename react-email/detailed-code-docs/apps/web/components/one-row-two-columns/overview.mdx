## High-level description
The `apps/web/components/one-row-two-columns` directory contains React components that demonstrate how to create email layouts with one row and two columns using the `@react-email/components` library. It provides two examples: one using inline styles (`inline-styles.tsx`) and another using Tailwind CSS (`tailwind.tsx`).

## What does it do?
This directory provides developers with ready-to-use examples of how to structure a simple email layout with one row and two columns. This is a common layout used in email marketing and newsletters. The examples showcase different styling approaches, allowing developers to choose the one that best suits their needs and project setup.

## Key Files
### `inline-styles.tsx`
This file demonstrates creating a one-row, two-column layout using inline styles. It defines a React component that renders two rows:

- The first row has two columns with a 50/50 width split.
- The second row has two columns with a 33.3333/66.6666 width split.

Each column is styled with a different background color to visually distinguish them.

### `tailwind.tsx`
This file demonstrates creating a one-row, two-column layout using Tailwind CSS for styling. It defines a React component that renders two rows:

- The first row has two columns with equal widths.
- The second row has two columns with a 1/3 - 2/3 width split.

This example showcases how to leverage Tailwind CSS classes to easily style and position the columns.

## Dependencies
Both files in this directory depend on the following:

- `@react-email/components`: This library provides React components specifically designed for email rendering, including the `Row` and `Column` components used to create the layout structure.
- `Layout`: This component, imported from `../_components/layout.tsx`, provides a basic HTML email structure and optionally supports Tailwind CSS.
