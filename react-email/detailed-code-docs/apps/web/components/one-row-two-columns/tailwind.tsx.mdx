## High-level description
This code defines a React component that showcases the use of the `Row` and `Column` components from the `@react-email/components` library to create a responsive email layout with two different row configurations: one with two equal-width columns and another with a 1/3 - 2/3 column split. The component is wrapped in a `Layout` component for basic styling and structure.

## Code Structure
The code defines two main symbols: `component` and a default exported arrow function. The `component` is a React fragment that holds the actual layout structure using `Row` and `Column` components. The default exported function renders the `component` within a `Layout` component.

## References
- `Row`, `Column` from `@react-email/components`
- `Layout` from `../_components/layout`

## Symbols
### `component`
#### Description
This symbol is a React fragment that defines the layout structure of two rows with different column configurations. The first row has two equal-width columns, while the second row has a 1/3 - 2/3 column split. Each column is styled with different background colors and text content to visually represent the layout.

#### Inputs
This symbol does not take any inputs.

#### Outputs
This symbol renders a React fragment containing the layout structure.

#### Internal Logic
The `component` uses the `Row` and `Column` components from `@react-email/components` to define the layout. Each `Column` component represents a single column within a row. The `align` prop is used to center the content within each column. The `className` prop applies Tailwind CSS classes for styling, including background color, height, and width.

### Default Exported Function
#### Description
This unnamed arrow function serves as the main component export. It renders the `component` within a `Layout` component, providing basic styling and structure to the email layout.

#### Inputs
This symbol does not take any inputs.

#### Outputs
This symbol renders the `component` wrapped in a `Layout` component.
