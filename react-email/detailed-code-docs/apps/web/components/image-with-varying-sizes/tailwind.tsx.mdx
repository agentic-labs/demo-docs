## High-level description
This code defines a React component that renders three images of the same source but with varying heights. The images are displayed within a layout component that provides basic styling and structure.

## Code Structure
The code defines two components: `component` and a default exported functional component. The `component` renders three `Img` components with different heights. The default exported component renders the `component` within a `Layout` component.

## Symbols

### `component`
#### Description
This component renders three `Img` components from the `@react-email/components` library. Each `Img` component displays the same image ("/static/atmos-vacuum-canister.jpg") with a different height (150px, 200px, and 250px). All images have the same alt text, are centered horizontally, and have rounded corners.

#### Inputs
This component does not accept any inputs.

#### Outputs
This component returns a React fragment containing three `Img` components.

### `default` (exported functional component)
#### Description
This is the default exported component that renders the `component` within a `Layout` component.

#### Inputs
This component does not accept any inputs.

#### Outputs
This component returns a `Layout` component which wraps the `component`.
