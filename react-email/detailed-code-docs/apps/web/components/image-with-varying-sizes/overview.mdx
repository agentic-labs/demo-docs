## High-level description
This directory contains two React components that demonstrate rendering images with varying heights in emails. Both components use the `Img` component from the `@react-email/components` library and display the same image ("/static/atmos-vacuum-canister.jpg") with heights of 150px, 200px, and 250px. The key difference between the two components lies in their styling approach: one uses inline styles (`inline-styles.tsx`), while the other utilizes Tailwind CSS (`tailwind.tsx`).

## What does it do?
Both components in this directory showcase how to render images with different heights in an email. They fetch an image from a static URL and display three instances of it, each with a distinct height. This demonstrates the flexibility of image rendering within email templates.

## Entry points
The main entry points for this directory are the `inline-styles.tsx` and `tailwind.tsx` files. These files represent two different approaches to styling the image components:

- `inline-styles.tsx`: This component directly applies styles to the image elements using the `style` attribute.
- `tailwind.tsx`: This component leverages Tailwind CSS classes for styling, offering a more maintainable and scalable approach.

## Dependencies
Both components share the following dependency:

- `@react-email/components`: This library provides React components specifically designed for email rendering. The `Img` component from this library is used to display the images.

Additionally, the `inline-styles.tsx` component also imports a `Layout` component from a local file, likely for basic page structure.
