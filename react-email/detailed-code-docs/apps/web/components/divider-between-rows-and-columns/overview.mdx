## High-level description
This directory showcases how to use the `@react-email/components` library to create email layouts with dividers between rows and columns. It provides two examples, one using inline styles (`inline-styles.tsx`) and another using Tailwind CSS (`tailwind.tsx`). Both examples demonstrate the same layout structure and functionality.

## What does it do?
Both files in this directory define React components that render an email layout with two rows of content separated by a horizontal divider. Each row contains two columns of text. The difference between the files lies in their styling approach: `inline-styles.tsx` applies styles directly within the component, while `tailwind.tsx` leverages Tailwind CSS classes for styling.

## Key Files
### `inline-styles.tsx`
This file demonstrates how to create the email layout using inline styles. It defines a React component that structures the layout using `Row`, `Column`, and `Hr` components from the `@react-email/components` library. Styles are applied directly to the elements using the `style` attribute.

### `tailwind.tsx`
This file showcases the same email layout but utilizes Tailwind CSS for styling. It defines a similar React component structure as `inline-styles.tsx`, but instead of inline styles, it applies pre-defined Tailwind CSS classes to the elements via the `className` attribute.

## Dependencies
Both files share the following dependencies:

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `@react-email/components` | Provides React components specifically designed for building email layouts, including `Column`, `Hr`, and `Row`. |
| `Layout` | Imported from `../_components/layout.tsx`, provides a basic email layout structure. |
