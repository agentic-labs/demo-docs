## High-level description
This code defines a React component that renders two rows of columns separated by a horizontal rule. It showcases the usage of `@react-email/components` for building email layouts.

## Code Structure
The code exports two symbols: `component` and a default function. The `component` is a React fragment that defines the layout structure with rows, columns, and a horizontal rule. The default function acts as a wrapper, embedding the `component` within a `Layout` component imported from another file.

## References
- `Layout`: Imported from `../_components/layout.tsx`, provides a basic email layout structure.

## Symbols

### `component`
#### Description
This symbol is a React fragment that defines the structure of two rows separated by a horizontal rule. Each row contains two columns with the text "First column" and "Second column".

#### Inputs
This symbol doesn't take any inputs.

#### Outputs
This symbol renders a React fragment containing the layout structure.

#### Internal Logic
The fragment uses `Row`, `Column`, and `Hr` components from `@react-email/components` to build the layout. The `Hr` component is styled with a top and bottom margin and a gray border color.

### `default` function
#### Description
This is a default exported function that renders the `component` within a `Layout` component.

#### Inputs
This function doesn't take any inputs.

#### Outputs
This function renders the `Layout` component with the `component` as its child.
