## High-level description
This code defines a React component that renders two rows of columns separated by a horizontal rule (HR) element. It showcases the usage of the `@react-email/components` library for building email layouts.

## Code Structure
The code defines two symbols: `component` and a default exported arrow function. The `component` is a React fragment that structures the layout of the email content, while the default exported function wraps this content within a `Layout` component.

## Symbols
### `component`
#### Description
This symbol is a React functional component that renders two rows of columns separated by a horizontal rule. It demonstrates the use of `Row`, `Column`, and `Hr` components from the `@react-email/components` library.

#### Inputs
This component does not accept any props.

#### Outputs
This component renders JSX that represents two rows of columns separated by a horizontal rule.

#### Internal Logic
The component uses the `Row` and `Column` components to create a two-column layout within each row. The `Hr` component is used to render a horizontal rule with specific styling applied using the `className` prop.

### `default export`
#### Description
This symbol is a default exported arrow function that renders the `component` within a `Layout` component.

#### Inputs
This function does not accept any arguments.

#### Outputs
This function returns JSX that renders the `component` wrapped in a `Layout` component.

#### Internal Logic
The function simply returns the `component` wrapped in a `Layout` component. The `Layout` component is imported from a local file and is responsible for providing a basic email layout structure.

## References
- `Layout`: This component is imported from `../_components/layout` and is used to wrap the main content.
