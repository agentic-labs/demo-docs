## High-level description
This code defines a React component that displays a simple image of an "Ode Grinder" within a layout structure. It utilizes the `@react-email/components` library for rendering email-compatible components.

## Code Structure
The code exports two symbols: `component` and a default function. The `component` is a React element representing the image itself, wrapped in `Img` component from `@react-email/components`. The default function acts as a wrapper, placing the `component` within a `Layout` component.

## References
- `Img` and `Layout` are referenced from external modules. `Img` is imported from `@react-email/components` and `Layout` is imported from a local file.

## Symbols
### `component`
#### Description
This symbol is a React element representing an image. It uses the `Img` component from the `@react-email/components` library to render an image that is compatible with emails.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSX.Element | `React.ReactElement` | A React element representing an image. |

#### Internal Logic
The `component` is defined using JSX syntax. It renders an `Img` component with the following properties:
- `alt`: Sets the alternative text for the image to "Ode Grinder".
- `className`: Applies the CSS class "mx-auto" for horizontal centering.
- `height`: Sets the image height to 250 pixels.
- `src`: Specifies the image source URL as "/static/ode-grinder.jpg".

### Default function
#### Description
This is a default exported function component that renders the main content of the component. It wraps the `component` with the `Layout` component.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSX.Element | `React.ReactElement` | A React element representing the layout with the image inside. |

#### Internal Logic
The function returns a JSX expression. It renders the `Layout` component and passes the `component` as children. This effectively places the image within the predefined layout structure.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @react-email/components | Provides email-compatible React components like `Img`. |
