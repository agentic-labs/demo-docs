## High-level description
This directory contains two React components that render a header followed by a numbered list of items. The two components achieve the same visual result using different styling approaches: one uses inline styles (`inline-styles.tsx`) and the other uses Tailwind CSS (`tailwind.tsx`).

## What does it do?
Both components display a header with a title and a brief description. Below the header, a numbered list of items is presented. Each item in the list consists of a number enclosed in a circle, a title, and a short paragraph of descriptive text. The components are intended for use in email templates, providing a visually appealing way to present structured information.

## Entry points
Developers can choose either `inline-styles.tsx` or `tailwind.tsx` depending on their preferred styling approach. Both components achieve the same visual result.

## Key Files
- **`inline-styles.tsx`**: This component defines the layout and styles directly within the component's code using inline styles. This approach provides tight coupling between styling and structure but can be less maintainable for complex components.
- **`tailwind.tsx`**: This component leverages Tailwind CSS for styling. It utilizes predefined CSS utility classes provided by Tailwind, resulting in cleaner and more maintainable code. This approach allows for easier customization and theming through Tailwind's configuration.

## Dependencies
Both components depend on the `@react-email/components` library, which provides pre-built React components specifically designed for creating email templates. This library ensures that the components render correctly across different email clients.
