## High-level description
The code defines a React component that renders a section with a header, a horizontal rule, and a numbered list of items. Each item in the list consists of a number enclosed in a circle and two lines of text. The component uses inline styles to define the layout and appearance of the elements.

## Code Structure
The code defines a single component that renders a series of nested elements. The main elements are `Section`, `Row`, `Column`, `Text`, and `Hr`. The `Section` element is used to group related content, the `Row` and `Column` elements are used to create a grid layout, the `Text` element is used to display text, and the `Hr` element is used to display a horizontal rule.

## Symbols

### `component`
#### Description
This symbol is a React component that renders a section with a header, a horizontal rule, and a numbered list of items. Each item in the list consists of a number enclosed in a circle and two lines of text.

#### Inputs
This component does not take any props.

#### Outputs
This component renders a React fragment containing the following elements:
- `Section`: A container for the entire component.
- `Row`: A container for the header text.
- `Text`: The header text "Functional Style".
- `Text`: A paragraph of text describing functional style.
- `Hr`: A horizontal rule.
- `Section`: A container for the first list item.
- `Row`: A container for the number and text of the first list item.
- `Column`: A container for the number of the first list item.
- `table`: A table used to center the number.
- `td`: A table cell containing the number "1".

- `Hr`: A horizontal rule.
- This pattern repeats for the remaining list items.

#### Internal Logic
The component uses inline styles to define the layout and appearance of the elements. The layout is based on a grid system, with rows and columns used to position the elements. The appearance of the elements is defined using CSS properties such as font size, color, and margin.
