## High-level description
The code defines a React component that renders a header followed by a numbered list of items. Each list item consists of a number within a circle, a title, and a description. The component utilizes the `@react-email/components` library for structure and styling.

## Code Structure
The code defines a single component as a functional React component. It uses components from `@react-email/components` library like `Section`, `Row`, `Column`, `Text`, and `Hr` to structure the layout. The component is then wrapped in a `Layout` component which provides basic HTML structure and Tailwind CSS configuration.

## References
- `Layout`: A custom component likely providing basic layout structure and styling.

## Symbols

### `component`
#### Description
This functional component renders a header followed by a numbered list of items. Each item in the list is structured with a number, a title, and a description.

#### Inputs
This component does not accept any props.

#### Outputs
This component returns a React fragment containing the rendered header and numbered list.

#### Internal Logic
The component uses a combination of `Section`, `Row`, `Column`, and `Text` components from the `@react-email/components` library to structure the layout. 

- A header is displayed first, with a title "Functional Style" and a short description.
- An `Hr` component is used to render a horizontal rule as a separator.
- The numbered list is created by repeating a section for each item. 
- Each section contains a `Row` with two `Column` components. 
    - The first column holds the item number within a styled circle.
    - The second column contains the item title and description using `Text` components.
- Each item is separated by another `Hr` component.
