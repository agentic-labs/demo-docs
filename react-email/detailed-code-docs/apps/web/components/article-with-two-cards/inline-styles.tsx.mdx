## High-level description
This code defines a React component that renders a section with a title, subtitle, and two columns, each containing an image, title, and description. This component is likely used for displaying featured articles or products in an email template.

## Code Structure
The code defines a functional component named `component` that renders the layout of the section. It uses the `@react-email/components` library for structuring the email content. The `component` is then wrapped with a `Layout` component, likely for applying common styles and structure.

## Symbols

### `component`
#### Description
This functional component defines the structure and content of the section with two cards. It uses `Row` and `Column` components from `@react-email/components` to arrange the content in a two-column layout. Each column contains an image, a title, and a description.

#### Inputs
This component does not accept any explicit inputs.

#### Outputs
This component returns a JSX element representing the rendered section with two cards.

#### Internal Logic
The component uses nested `Row` and `Column` components to structure the layout. Each column contains an `Img` component for displaying an image, and `Text` components for the title and description. Inline styles are used to control the appearance of each element.
