## High-level description
This code defines a React component that renders Markdown content with custom styles for specific elements like headings (h1, h2) and inline code. It utilizes the `@react-email/components` library for Markdown rendering and email-specific styling. The component is then wrapped within a `Layout` component for consistent page structure.

## Code Structure
The code defines two components: `component` and a default unnamed functional component. The `component` renders the Markdown content with custom styles using the `Markdown` component from `@react-email/components`. The default component renders the `Layout` component, passing the `component` as children.

## References
- `Layout`: A component from `../_components/layout` that provides a basic layout structure for the email.

## Symbols

### `component`
#### Description
This component renders Markdown content with custom styles applied to specific elements. It uses the `Markdown` component from the `@react-email/components` library and provides custom styles through the `markdownCustomStyles` prop.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props.

#### Outputs
This component renders a `Markdown` component with custom styles applied.

#### Internal Logic
The component defines an object `markdownCustomStyles` that maps HTML elements to their corresponding styles. This object is passed as a prop to the `Markdown` component, which applies these styles during rendering.

### Default Function Component
#### Description
This unnamed functional component serves as the entry point for rendering. It renders the `Layout` component and passes the `component` as children.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props.

#### Outputs
This component renders the `Layout` component with the `component` nested inside.
