## Symbols

### `component`
#### Description
A React component that renders a section with images arranged on a horizontal grid layout. It displays "Bundle & Save" collections with images and links to different product categories.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props.

#### Outputs
JSX for a section element containing a grid of images and text content.

#### Internal Logic
The component uses a combination of `Section`, `Row`, `Column`, `Text`, `Link`, and `Img` components from the `@react-email/components` library to structure the layout and display content. 

- It first renders a header section with title, subtitle, and a brief description.
- Then, it renders a grid of images within two columns. 
    - The left column contains two images stacked vertically, each wrapped in a link.
    - The right column contains a single image, also wrapped in a link.
- Each image has an alt text, source URL, and inline styles for dimensions and appearance.
