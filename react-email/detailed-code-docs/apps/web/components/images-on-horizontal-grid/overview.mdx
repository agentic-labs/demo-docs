## High-level description
The `apps/web/components/images-on-horizontal-grid` directory houses two React components designed to display a grid of images within an email template. Both components showcase "Bundle & Save" collections, featuring coffee grinders and bundles, using images and links. The key difference between the two implementations lies in their styling approach: one utilizes inline styles (`inline-styles.tsx`), while the other leverages Tailwind CSS (`tailwind.tsx`).

## What does it do?
Both components render a visually similar output: a section with a heading, a brief description of "Bundle & Save" collections, and a grid of images. The grid consists of two columns, with the left column displaying two images stacked vertically and the right column showcasing a single, larger image. Each image is wrapped in a link, presumably directing users to the corresponding product collection.

The primary distinction lies in how each component handles styling. The `inline-styles.tsx` component directly embeds style attributes within the JSX elements, leading to a more self-contained but potentially less maintainable approach. Conversely, the `tailwind.tsx` component leverages Tailwind CSS classes to apply pre-defined styles, promoting reusability and consistency across the application.

## Entry points
- `inline-styles.tsx`: This file contains the component implementation using inline styles.
- `tailwind.tsx`: This file houses the component implementation utilizing Tailwind CSS classes.

Developers can choose the entry point that aligns with their preferred styling approach. Both components achieve the same visual outcome, differing only in their styling methodology.
