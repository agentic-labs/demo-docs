## High-level description
This code defines a React component that displays a grid of images with links, representing product collections. It utilizes the `@react-email/components` library for structuring the layout and elements specifically for email rendering. The component is then wrapped in a `Layout` component for consistent styling and structure.

## Code Structure
The code defines two symbols: `component` and an unnamed default export function. The `component` is a functional React component that renders the image grid. The default export function simply renders the `component` within a `Layout` component.

## References
- `Layout`: This is a custom component likely defined in `apps/web/components/_components/layout.tsx`. It probably provides a common layout structure for email components.

## Symbols
### `component`
#### Description
This functional React component renders a section with a grid of images, each wrapped in a link. The grid layout is achieved using `Row` and `Column` components from `@react-email/components`.

#### Inputs
This component does not accept any props.

#### Outputs
This component renders a JSX structure representing a section with an image grid.

#### Internal Logic
The component first renders a section with a heading and description for the "Bundle & Save" collections. Then, it renders another section containing a two-column grid. The left column displays two images stacked vertically, while the right column displays a single, taller image. Each image is wrapped in a `Link` component, presumably linking to the respective product collection.
