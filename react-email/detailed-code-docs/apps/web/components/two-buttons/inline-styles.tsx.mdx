## High-level description
This code defines a React component that renders two buttons, "Login" and "Sign up", styled to appear side-by-side within an email template. Both buttons link to `https://react.email`.

## Code Structure
The code exports two symbols: `component` and a default function. The `component` is a React element representing the two buttons within a layout structure. The default function wraps the `component` within a `Layout` component and exports it for use in an email template.

## Symbols

### `component`
#### Description
This symbol is a React element that defines the structure and styling of two buttons ("Login" and "Sign up") displayed side-by-side. It utilizes `Row` and `Column` components from `@react-email/components` for layout and applies inline styles for visual presentation.

#### Inputs
This symbol does not accept any inputs.

#### Outputs
This symbol returns a React element representing two styled buttons within a layout structure.

#### Internal Logic
The component uses a `Row` to arrange the buttons horizontally. Each button is placed within a `Column` for vertical centering and assigned a width of 50% to occupy equal space. Inline styles are applied to each button to control padding, background color, border, text styling, and link destination.

### `default` (anonymous function)
#### Description
This is a default exported anonymous function that renders the `component` within a `Layout` component.

#### Inputs
This symbol does not accept any inputs.

#### Outputs
This symbol returns a React element representing the `component` wrapped in a `Layout` component.

#### Internal Logic
The function simply returns the `component` wrapped within a `&lt;Layout&gt;` component. This suggests that the `Layout` component likely provides a consistent structure or styling for email templates.

- `@react-email/components`: This library provides components like `Button`, `Column`, and `Row` used for structuring the email content.
- `../_components/layout`: This refers to a local file that likely exports the `Layout` component used to wrap the button component.
