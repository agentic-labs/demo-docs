## High-level description
This code defines a React component that renders two buttons, "Login" and "Sign up", side-by-side within a responsive layout. The buttons are styled using Tailwind CSS and link to the `react.email` website.

## Code Structure
The code defines two components: `component` and a default export. The `component` is a functional component that renders the two buttons within a nested structure of `Row` and `Column` components from the `@react-email/components` library. The default export is another functional component that wraps the `component` within a `Layout` component.

## References
- `Button`, `Column`, `Row` from `@react-email/components`
- `Layout` from `../_components/layout`
