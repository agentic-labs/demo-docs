## High-level description
The `apps/web/components/two-buttons` directory contains two React components that render two buttons, "Login" and "Sign up", side-by-side. These components are designed for use in email templates and offer different styling options: one using inline styles and the other using Tailwind CSS.

## What does it do?
This directory provides reusable components for rendering a pair of buttons commonly used in email templates, such as for prompting users to log in or sign up. Each component defines the layout and styling of the buttons, ensuring consistency across different email templates.

## Key Files
### `inline-styles.tsx`
This file defines a React component that renders the two buttons with inline styles. It provides a self-contained styling solution without external dependencies.

### `tailwind.tsx`
This file defines a React component that renders the two buttons using Tailwind CSS classes. This approach leverages the flexibility and maintainability of a CSS framework.

## Dependencies
Both components rely on the `@react-email/components` library for layout and button elements. This library provides React components specifically designed for creating email templates, ensuring compatibility and responsiveness across different email clients.
