## High-level description
This directory contains two React components designed to render an article section with an image on the right side and text content on the left. These components are intended for use in email templates, specifically for a "What's new" section highlighting a product. Both components utilize the `@react-email/components` library for email-specific rendering, but they differ in their styling approach: one uses inline styles (`inline-styles.tsx`), while the other employs Tailwind CSS (`tailwind.tsx`).

## What does it do?
Both components render an article section suitable for an email template. This section is structured with an image on the right and text content on the left. The text content typically includes a title like "What's new," a product heading, a brief description, and a "Read more" link. The image on the right visually complements the product being highlighted. The components ensure that this layout adapts responsively to different screen sizes, a crucial aspect of email design.

## Entry points
- `inline-styles.tsx`: This component uses inline styles for styling the article section.
- `tailwind.tsx`: This component utilizes Tailwind CSS classes for styling.

Developers can choose the component that aligns with their preferred styling approach. Both components are wrapped within a `Layout` component, likely for consistent styling and structure across different email templates.
