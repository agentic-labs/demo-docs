## High-level description
This code defines a React component that renders a section with an image on the right and text content on the left. It's designed for use in email templates, showcasing a "What's new" section with a product highlight. The component uses responsive design to adapt to different screen sizes.

## Code Structure
The code exports two symbols: `component` and a default function. The `component` is a functional React component that represents the actual layout and content of the article with an image. The default function simply wraps the `component` within a `Layout` component, likely for consistent styling and structure across different email templates.

## Symbols

### `component`
#### Description
This functional component defines the structure and content of an article section with an image displayed on the right side and text content on the left. It utilizes various components from the `@react-email/components` library for email-specific rendering.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any explicit input parameters.

#### Outputs
This component returns a JSX structure representing an article section with an image on the right and text on the left.

#### Internal Logic
The component uses `Section` components to structure the layout. The left `Section` contains `Text` components for the title ("What's new"), heading ("Versatile Comfort"), description, and a `Link` to "Read more". The right `Section` houses an `Img` component displaying an image related to the article. Inline styles are heavily used to control the appearance and layout of these elements.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `@react-email/components` | Provides email-specific React components like `Img`, `Link`, `Section`, and `Text` for rendering in email clients. |

## TODOs
- The code uses an inline image source `/static/versatile-comfort.jpg`. Consider using a more robust method for image handling in email templates, such as embedding or using a dedicated image hosting service.
