## High-level description
The code defines a React component that renders an article section with an image on the right side. It uses the `@react-email/components` library for email-specific components and Tailwind CSS for styling. The component is wrapped in a `Layout` component for consistent structure.

## Code Structure
The code defines a functional React component named `component` which represents the article section with an image. This component is then used within another functional component (default export) which wraps it within a `Layout` component.

## Symbols

### `component`
#### Description
This functional component renders an article section with an image on the right side. It uses `Section`, `Text`, `Link` and `Img` components from `@react-email/components` library for structuring and displaying the content.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any explicit inputs.

#### Outputs
Returns a React element representing an article section with an image on the right.

#### Internal Logic
The component uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling and layout. It consists of two main sections:
- The left section contains the article title, description, and a "Read more" link.
- The right section contains an image.

### `default` (anonymous export)
#### Description
This functional component serves as the entry point for rendering the article component. It wraps the `component` within a `Layout` component.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any explicit inputs.

#### Outputs
Returns a React element representing the `component` wrapped in a `Layout`.

#### Internal Logic
The component simply renders the `Layout` component and passes the `component` as children.
