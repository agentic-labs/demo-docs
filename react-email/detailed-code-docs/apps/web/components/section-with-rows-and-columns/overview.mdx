## High-level description
This code defines a React component that renders a simple email layout with two rows and two columns using the `@react-email/components` library. It showcases a basic structure for arranging content within an email template.

## Code Structure
The code exports two symbols: `component` and a default function component. The `component` is a simple React element representing the email layout with rows and columns. The default function component renders the `Layout` component and passes the `component` as children. The `Layout` component (defined in a separate file) is responsible for rendering the overall HTML structure of the email, including head elements and styling.

## References
- `Layout`: This symbol is imported from `../_components/layout` and is used to render the overall HTML structure of the email.

## Symbols

### `component`
#### Description
This symbol is a React element that defines the structure of the email content. It uses `Section`, `Row`, and `Column` components from the `@react-email/components` library to create a two-row, two-column layout. Each column contains simple text indicating its position within the layout.

#### Outputs

### `default` (anonymous function component)
#### Description
