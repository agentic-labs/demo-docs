## High-level description
This directory contains two React components that render a section with a header and three centered paragraphs with icons. The two components are nearly identical, with the only difference being the styling approach: one uses inline styles (`inline-styles.tsx`) while the other uses Tailwind CSS (`tailwind.tsx`).

## What does it do?
Both components render a visually consistent section within an email template. This section is structured with a header at the top, followed by three columns of content. Each column features an icon, a title, and a paragraph of text. The content itself appears to be related to furniture, suggesting its use in a promotional email for furniture products or services.

## Entry points
The main entry points are the two files: `inline-styles.tsx` and `tailwind.tsx`. Developers can choose which file to use based on their preferred styling approach. Both files export a default component that wraps the core section component within a `Layout` component for consistent styling and structure.

## Key Files
- **inline-styles.tsx:** This file defines the component using inline styles for all visual aspects.
- **tailwind.tsx:** This file defines the component using Tailwind CSS classes for styling.

## Dependencies
Both `inline-styles.tsx` and `tailwind.tsx` share the same dependencies:

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `@react-email/components` | Provides React components specifically designed for building responsive email templates. |
| `../_components/layout` | Imports a custom `Layout` component, likely for consistent styling and structure across the application's email templates. |
