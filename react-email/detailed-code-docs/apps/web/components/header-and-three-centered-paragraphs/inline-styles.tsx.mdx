## High-level description
The code defines a React component that renders a section with a header, three centered paragraphs, and corresponding icons. It utilizes the `@react-email/components` library for structuring the layout and content. The component is then wrapped in a `Layout` component, likely for consistent styling and structure across the application.

## Code Structure
The code defines a functional React component that returns JSX for rendering a section with a specific layout. It uses `Row` and `Column` components from `@react-email/components` to structure the content into a header and three columns. Each column contains an image, a title, and a paragraph. The entire section is wrapped in a `Layout` component.

## Symbols

### `component`
#### Description
This symbol is a React component that renders a section with a header, three centered paragraphs, and corresponding icons. It's designed to be embedded within an email template.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props.

#### Outputs
JSX structure representing a section with a header, three centered paragraphs, and corresponding icons.

#### Internal Logic
The component uses `Row` and `Column` components from `@react-email/components` to structure the content. Each column contains an `Img` component for displaying an icon, a `Text` component for the title, and another `Text` component for the paragraph. Inline styles are used extensively to control the layout and appearance of the elements.

### `default` (anonymous exported function)
#### Description
This is the default export of the module. It's a React component that wraps the `component` within a `Layout` component.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props.

#### Outputs
JSX structure representing the `component` wrapped in a `Layout` component.

#### Internal Logic
The component simply renders the `Layout` component and passes the `component` as its child. This suggests that `Layout` provides some common styling or structure for the application's email templates.
