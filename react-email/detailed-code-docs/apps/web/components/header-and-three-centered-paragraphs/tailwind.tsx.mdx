## High-level description
The code defines a React component that renders a section with a header, three centered paragraphs, and associated icons. This component is designed for use in an email template, likely promoting furniture, as suggested by the text content and imagery.

## Code Structure
The code defines a functional React component that returns JSX. The JSX structures the content into a header section and a section with three columns, each containing an icon, a title, and a paragraph. The component utilizes the `@react-email/components` library for email-specific rendering and layout.

## Symbols

### `component`
#### Description
This symbol is a React component that renders a section with a header and three centered paragraphs, each accompanied by an icon. It's designed for use in an email template.

#### Inputs
This component does not accept any props.

#### Outputs
Returns JSX that renders a section with a header and three centered paragraphs, each with an icon.

#### Internal Logic
The component uses `Row` and `Column` components from `@react-email/components` to structure the layout. Each column contains an `Img` component for displaying an icon, and `Text` components for the title and paragraph. The content and styling are statically defined within the component.

### `default` (anonymous exported function)
#### Description
This is the default exported component, wrapping the `component` within a `Layout` component.

#### Inputs
This component does not accept any props.

#### Outputs
Returns JSX that renders the `component` wrapped in a `Layout` component.

#### Internal Logic
This component simply renders the `component` within a `Layout` component, presumably to apply consistent styling and structure to the email template.
