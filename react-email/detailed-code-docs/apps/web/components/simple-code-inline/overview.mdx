## High-level description
This directory provides two React components for rendering inline code snippets within text paragraphs. Both components utilize the `@react-email/components` library for rendering email-safe HTML and styling. The components differ in their styling approach: one uses inline styles while the other leverages Tailwind CSS.

## What does it do?
This directory provides reusable components for displaying code snippets within text, specifically designed for email rendering. Both components achieve the same visual result: a code snippet highlighted against the surrounding text. They differ in how they apply styles, offering flexibility for different styling preferences within the project.

## Entry points
The main entry points for each styling approach are the default exported components within `inline-styles.tsx` and `tailwind.tsx`. Both components render the same content but with different styling implementations.

## Key Files
- **inline-styles.tsx:** This file defines a component that directly applies inline styles to the code snippet using the `style` attribute. This approach provides direct control over the element's appearance.
- **tailwind.tsx:** This file defines a component that utilizes Tailwind CSS classes for styling the code snippet. This approach leverages the utility-first nature of Tailwind CSS for concise and reusable styles.

## Dependencies
- **@react-email/components:** This library provides the necessary components for building email-safe HTML, including `Text`, `CodeInline`, and `Layout`. It ensures that the rendered output is compatible with various email clients.
