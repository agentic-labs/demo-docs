## High-level description
This code defines a React component that renders an inline code snippet within a text paragraph. The snippet is styled to stand out visually with a gray background, rounded corners, and padding. The component is then wrapped in a layout component for display.

## Code Structure
The code defines two components: `component` and a default export component. The `component` renders the text with the inline code snippet using `CodeInline` from `@react-email/components`. The default export component simply renders the `component` within a `Layout` component.

## Symbols

### `component`
#### Description
This component renders a text paragraph with an inline code snippet styled for visual emphasis.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props.

#### Outputs
JSX.Element representing a text paragraph with a styled inline code snippet.

#### Internal Logic
The component uses `Text` and `CodeInline` components from the `@react-email/components` library to render the text and code snippet. The `CodeInline` component is styled with a gray background, rounded corners, and padding.

### `default` (export)
#### Description
This component renders the `component` within a `Layout` component.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props.

#### Outputs
JSX.Element representing the `component` wrapped in a `Layout`.

#### Internal Logic
The component simply renders the `component` within a `Layout` component, presumably for consistent styling and structure.
