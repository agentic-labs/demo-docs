title: "postcss.config.js"
---

## High-level description
This code defines a PostCSS configuration file for a web application. It enables the use of Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling and Autoprefixer to automatically add vendor prefixes to CSS rules for cross-browser compatibility.

## Symbols
### `module.exports`
#### Description
This symbol defines the configuration object that is exported from this module. This object is used by PostCSS to determine which plugins to use and how to configure them.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `module.exports` | Object | An object containing the PostCSS configuration. |

#### Internal Logic
The configuration object has a single property, `plugins`, which is an object listing the PostCSS plugins to be used. Each key in the `plugins` object is the name of a plugin, and the value is its configuration.

*   `tailwindcss`: This plugin enables the use of Tailwind CSS. It is configured with an empty object, which means it will use the default Tailwind CSS configuration.
*   `autoprefixer`: This plugin automatically adds vendor prefixes to CSS rules, ensuring cross-browser compatibility. It is also configured with an empty object, meaning it will use its default settings.
