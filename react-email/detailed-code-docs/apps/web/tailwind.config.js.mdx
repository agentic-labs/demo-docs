## Symbols

### `iOsHeight`
#### Description
This symbol defines a Tailwind CSS plugin that adds utilities for handling iOS-specific height issues related to the virtual keyboard. It uses the `@supports` rule to target devices that support touch input and applies specific styles to ensure elements occupy the full screen height even when the keyboard is visible.

#### Inputs
This symbol does not take any explicit inputs.

#### Outputs
This symbol does not return any explicit outputs. It modifies the Tailwind CSS configuration by adding new utility classes.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Define `supportsTouchRule`:** This variable stores the CSS media query `@supports (-webkit-touch-callout: none)` which targets devices that support touch input.
2. **Define `webkitFillAvailable`:** This variable stores the CSS value `-webkit-fill-available` which is used to make an element fill the available space in a container.
3. **Define `utilities`:** This object defines the new utility classes that will be added to the Tailwind CSS configuration. It includes two classes:
    - `.min-h-screen-ios`: Sets the minimum height of an element to fill the available screen height on iOS devices with touch support.
    - `.h-screen-ios`: Sets the height of an element to fill the available screen height on iOS devices with touch support.
4. **Add Utilities:** The `addUtilities` function from the `tailwindcss/plugin` module is used to add the defined `utilities` to the Tailwind CSS configuration. The second argument `['responsive']` ensures that these utilities are responsive.

#### Side Effects
This symbol modifies the Tailwind CSS configuration by adding new utility classes.

### `module.exports`
#### Description
This symbol defines the main configuration object for Tailwind CSS. It specifies the content paths to scan for Tailwind CSS classes, customizes the theme, and includes plugins.

#### Inputs
This symbol does not take any explicit inputs.

#### Outputs
This symbol returns a configuration object that adheres to the `import('tailwindcss').Config` type.

#### Internal Logic
1. **`content`:** Specifies an array of file paths or glob patterns that Tailwind CSS should scan to generate its CSS. In this case, it's configured to look for files with the extensions `.js`, `.ts`, `.jsx`, and `.tsx` within the `src` directory.
2. **`theme`:** Allows for customizing the default Tailwind CSS theme.
    - **`extend`:** Merges new styles with the default theme without overriding them.
        - **`colors`:** Defines custom color palettes using the `@radix-ui/colors` library. It adds `cyan` and `slate` color palettes with various shades.
        - **`fontFamily`:** Extends the default font families by adding `sans` and `mono` font families.
        - **`backgroundImage`:** Defines custom background image utilities for gradients and a "shine" effect.
        - **`keyframes`:** Defines custom CSS animations for "shine" and "dash" effects.
3. **`plugins`:** An array of Tailwind CSS plugins to be included in the build. In this case, it includes the custom `iOsHeight` plugin.
