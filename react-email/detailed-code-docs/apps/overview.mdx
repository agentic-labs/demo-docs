## High-level description
The `apps` directory contains three main subdirectories: `demo`, `docs`, and `web`. Each of these serves a distinct purpose within the React Email ecosystem:

1. `demo`: A demonstration application showcasing various email templates built using the `@react-email` library.
2. `docs`: Documentation for the `render` utility, a core component of the React Email library.
3. `web`: A Next.js web application that serves as a showcase and documentation platform for React Email components.

Together, these applications provide a comprehensive suite of tools and resources for developers working with React Email.

## What does it do?
The `apps` directory collectively provides the following functionalities:

1. Email Template Showcase: The `demo` app offers a wide range of email templates for various scenarios, demonstrating the capabilities of the `@react-email` library.

2. Development Environment: Both the `demo` and `web` apps provide development environments for creating and testing email templates using React and Next.js.

3. Documentation: The `docs` app explains the `render` utility, which is crucial for converting React components into HTML email templates. The `web` app also serves as an interactive documentation platform.

4. Component Browser: The `web` app includes a component browser for exploring different categories of email components, with rendered previews and source code access.

5. API for Email Testing: The `web` app provides an API route for sending test emails and saving email details to a database.

6. Export Functionality: The `demo` app allows developers to export email templates for use in other applications or email sending services.

The typical workflow for a developer using these apps might include:

1. Exploring the `web` app to learn about React Email and browse available components.
2. Referring to the `docs` to understand how to use the `render` utility.
3. Using the `demo` app to see full email templates in action and as a starting point for their own templates.
4. Developing and testing their own email templates using the provided development environments.
5. Exporting the finished templates for use in their own projects.

## Entry points
The main entry points for the `apps` directory are:

1. Demo App:
   - Email Components in the `emails` subdirectory
   - Next.js application files (e.g., `pages/index.js`)
   - Build and development scripts in `package.json`

2. Docs:
   - Documentation files for the `render` utility

3. Web App:
   - `src/app/layout.tsx`: Root layout for the entire application
   - `src/app/page.tsx`: Home page
   - `src/app/components/page.tsx` and `src/app/components/[slug]/page.tsx`: Components browser
   - `src/app/examples/page.tsx`: Examples page
   - `src/app/api/send/route.ts`: API route for sending test emails

## Dependencies
The applications in the `apps` directory rely on several key dependencies:

1. React and React DOM: Core libraries for building user interfaces
2. Next.js: React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation
3. @react-email/components: Provides React components for creating HTML emails
4. react-email: Core library for building emails with React
5. @supabase/supabase-js: For database interactions in the web app
6. resend: For sending transactional emails
7. zod: For request body validation
8. framer-motion: For UI animations
9. Tailwind CSS: For styling components and layouts

These dependencies were chosen to create robust development environments for building, testing, and showcasing email templates using React, with additional tools for enhanced functionality and user experience.

## Configuration
Configuration across the `apps` directory includes:

1. Environment Variables:
   - `VERCEL_URL` in the demo app
   - Various API keys and database URLs in the web app

2. Scripts:
   - Build, development, and export scripts defined in `package.json` files

3. Tailwind CSS Configuration:
   - Custom colors, fonts, and animations defined in `tailwind.config.js`

4. Next.js Configuration:
   - Redirects, rewrites, and custom headers defined in `next.config.js`

5. Component Structure:
   - `componentsStructure` array in the web app defining the structure of component categories

6. SEO Configuration:
   - Metadata objects in various files
   - `robots.ts` and `sitemap.ts` files for web crawler behavior and sitemap generation

These configuration elements allow for easy modification of the applications' behavior, component structure, and SEO settings without changing the core logic.

In summary, the `apps` directory provides a comprehensive suite of applications and tools for developers working with React Email. It offers demonstration templates, documentation, a component browser, and development environments, all designed to facilitate the creation and testing of email templates using React components.
