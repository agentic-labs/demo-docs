## High-level description
This code defines a bug report template for the React Email project on GitHub. It provides a structured form for users to report bugs, including fields for describing the bug, affected packages, reproduction steps, expected behavior, and system information. 

This template helps ensure that bug reports are consistent, informative, and actionable, making it easier for maintainers to understand and address the reported issues.

## Symbols
### `1.bug_report.yml`
#### Description
This YAML file defines a bug report template for GitHub issues in the React Email project. It structures the issue submission form with various fields to guide users in providing comprehensive bug information.

#### Inputs
This file does not take any inputs. It is a configuration file.

#### Outputs
This file does not have direct outputs. It defines the structure and content of a bug report template on GitHub.

#### Internal Logic
The file uses YAML syntax to define the following sections:

* **`name`**: Specifies the template name displayed in the GitHub issue creation dropdown.
* **`description`**: Provides a brief explanation of the template's purpose.
* **`labels`**:  Automatically applies the "Type: Bug" label to issues created using this template.
* **`body`**: Defines the form fields for the bug report, including:
    * **`type`**:  Specifies the input type for each field (e.g., `textarea`, `dropdown`, `input`, `markdown`).
    * **`attributes`**:  Sets attributes for each field, such as `label`, `description`, `multiple` (for dropdown), and `options` (for dropdown values).
    * **`validations`**:  Enforces data validation, like requiring certain fields (`required: true`).

The template includes fields for:

* **Describe the Bug**: A detailed description of the issue.
* **Which package is affected**: A multi-select dropdown to identify the specific React Email package(s) involved.
* **Link to the code that reproduces this issue**: A required field for a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug.
* **To Reproduce**: Steps to reproduce the bug based on the provided code reproduction.
* **Expected Behavior**: The expected outcome.
* **Guidance**: Markdown text reminding users to ensure their steps are clear and reproducible.
* **Node version**:  A field for specifying the Node.js version if relevant.

#### Side Effects
This template, when used, will pre-populate a new GitHub issue with the defined fields and structure. This encourages consistent and informative bug reports.

## Configuration
This file itself acts as a configuration for the GitHub issue template. The fields, their types, descriptions, and validation rules are all configurable options within this YAML file.
