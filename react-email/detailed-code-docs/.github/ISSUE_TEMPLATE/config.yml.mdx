## High-level description
This YAML file configures issue templates for the repository. It disables blank issues and provides contact links for asking questions and making feature requests.

## Configuration
This file configures the following options for issue templates:

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| `blank_issues_enabled` | boolean | true | Whether to allow users to open issues without using a template. Set to `false` to disable blank issues. |
| `contact_links` | list | - | A list of contact links to display on the issue creation page. Each link has a `name`, `url`, and `about` field. |

## Symbols
### `blank_issues_enabled: false`
#### Description
This line disables the creation of blank issues in the repository. Users will be required to use one of the provided issue templates or contact links.

### `contact_links`
#### Description
This section defines a list of contact links that will be displayed on the issue creation page. 

#### Internal Logic
Each link in the list is a dictionary with the following keys:

* `name`: The display name of the link.
* `url`: The URL of the link.
* `about`: A short description of the link's purpose.

In this case, two links are provided:

* **Ask a question:** This link directs users to the GitHub Discussions forum for the repository.
* **Feature request:** This link directs users to create a new discussion in the "Ideas" category of the GitHub Discussions forum.
