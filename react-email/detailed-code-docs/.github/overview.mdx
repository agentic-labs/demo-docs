## High-level description
The `.github` directory contains configuration files and templates for GitHub-specific features and automation workflows. It includes templates for GitHub Discussions and Issues, a pull request template, and GitHub Actions workflows for automating various development processes.

## What does it do?
This directory serves several important functions in the project's development lifecycle:

1. Standardizes communication: It provides templates for discussions, issues, and pull requests, ensuring that users and contributors provide necessary information in a structured format.

2. Automates version management: Workflows are set up to automatically bump versions and create release pull requests for both canary (pre-release) and stable versions.

3. Ensures code quality: A comprehensive testing workflow runs checks for formatting, linting, building, and dependency management on pushes to the main branch and on pull requests.

4. Guides users: It provides clear instructions for different types of contributions and directs users to appropriate channels for questions and feature requests.

## Key Files

1. **DISCUSSION_TEMPLATE**:
   - `help.yml`: Template for seeking help, prompting users to provide a summary, context, and reproduction steps.
   - `ideas.yml`: Template for proposing new features, guiding users to articulate goals, background, and implementation ideas.

2. **ISSUE_TEMPLATE**:
   - `1.bug_report.yml`: Structured template for reporting bugs, ensuring all necessary information is provided.
   - `config.yml`: Configures issue templates, disabling blank issues and providing contact links.

3. **pull_request_template.md**: Provides a checklist and naming convention for pull requests, ensuring consistency and completeness.

4. **workflows**:
   - `bump-canary.yml`: Automates version bumping and release pull request creation for the canary branch.
   - `bump-stable.yml`: Similar to bump-canary, but for the main branch and stable releases.
   - `tests.yml`: Runs comprehensive checks including formatting, testing, building, and dependency management.

## Dependencies
The workflows rely on several GitHub Actions:
- `actions/checkout`
- `actions/setup-node`
- `buildjet/cache`
- `changesets/action`

The project uses pnpm as its package manager.

## Configuration
Key configurations include:
- Node.js versions: 20 for bump workflows, 18 for tests workflow
- Runners: `ubuntu-latest` for bump workflows, `buildjet-4vcpu-ubuntu-2204` for tests
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` secret for authentication
- Environment variables and script commands for managing workflow execution

This setup provides a comprehensive framework for maintaining code quality, managing releases, and facilitating clear communication within the project's GitHub repository.
