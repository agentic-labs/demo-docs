## High-level description
The `.github/DISCUSSION_TEMPLATE` directory houses templates for GitHub Discussions, providing a structured format for users to submit issues, ideas, or requests for help. This encourages clear and organized communication within the community.

## What does it do?
When a user creates a new discussion on GitHub, these templates offer pre-defined fields to guide the submission. This ensures that essential information is captured, making it easier for maintainers and contributors to understand and address the topic at hand.

## Key Files
- **`help.yml`**: This file defines a template specifically for seeking help. It prompts users to provide a summary of their issue, additional context (like code snippets or error messages), and a link to a minimal reproduction of the problem. This structure helps in quickly diagnosing and resolving technical challenges.

- **`ideas.yml`**: This file focuses on structuring discussions around new feature ideas. It prompts users to articulate the goals of their proposal, provide background information and context, and outline their proposed implementation. This framework encourages well-defined and well-motivated feature requests.
