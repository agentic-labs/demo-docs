## High-level description
This YAML file defines a template for GitHub Discussions in the repository. It structures the submission form for new discussions by prompting users for a summary, optional additional information, and a link to a minimal reproduction of the issue.

### `body`
#### Description
This section defines the structure and content of the form used to create a new discussion. It consists of three fields: "Summary," "Additional information," and "Example."

#### Internal Logic
The `body` section uses a list of dictionaries to define each field in the form. Each dictionary represents a form field and uses the following structure:

- `type`: Specifies the type of input field (e.g., `textarea`, `input`).
- `attributes`: Contains attributes like `label` (field name displayed to the user) and `description` (additional information about the field).
- `validations`: Specifies any validation rules for the field, such as `required: true`.

#### `Summary` field
- `type`: `textarea`
- `attributes`:
    - `label`: "Summary"
    - `description`: "What do you need help with?"
- `validations`:
    - `required`: `true`

This field is a required text area where users provide a concise summary of their issue.

#### `Additional information` field
- `type`: `textarea`
- `attributes`:
    - `label`: "Additional information"
    - `description`: "Any code snippets, error messages, or dependency details that may be related?"
    - `render`: `js`
- `validations`:
    - `required`: `false`

This optional text area allows users to provide more context, including code snippets, error messages, or details about dependencies. The `render: js` attribute might indicate that this field supports JavaScript rendering for improved formatting or functionality.

#### `Example` field
- `type`: `input`
- `attributes`:
    - `label`: "Example"
    - `description`: "A link to a minimal reproduction is helpful for collaborative debugging!"
- `validations`:
    - `required`: `false`

This optional input field allows users to share a link to a minimal reproduction of the issue, which can be helpful for debugging and collaboration.
