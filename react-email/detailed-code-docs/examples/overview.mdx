## High-level description
This directory contains a collection of example projects demonstrating how to integrate various email services and APIs with React Email components. The examples cover popular email services such as AWS SES, MailerSend, Nodemailer, Plunk, Postmark, Resend, Scaleway, and SendGrid. Each example showcases how to create email templates using React components and send them using the respective email service's API.

## What does it do?
The examples in this directory demonstrate:

1. Creating reusable email templates using React components.
2. Rendering these templates to HTML.
3. Integrating with different email service APIs to send the rendered emails.
4. Configuring and using various email services within different application contexts (e.g., Node.js scripts, Next.js API routes).

These examples provide developers with practical implementations for sending transactional emails using modern web technologies and popular email services.

## Entry points
Each example project has its own entry points, typically found in `src/index.tsx` or `pages/api/send.ts` (for Next.js examples). These files usually contain the main logic for rendering email templates and sending emails using the respective service's API.

## Key Files
Common key files across the examples include:

1. `src/email.tsx` or similar: Defines the React component for the email template.
2. `src/index.tsx` or `pages/api/send.ts`: Main entry point for rendering and sending emails.
3. Configuration files: `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, and `.eslintrc.js`.

## Dependencies
While specific versions may vary, common dependencies across the examples include:

1. React and React DOM
2. TypeScript
3. Service-specific SDK or API client (e.g., `@aws-sdk/client-ses`, `@sendgrid/mail`)
4. `@react-email/components` for building email templates
5. Build tools like `tsup` or Next.js

## Configuration
Most examples use environment variables for API keys and other sensitive information. Common configuration elements include:

1. TypeScript configuration in `tsconfig.json`
2. ESLint configuration in `.eslintrc.js`
3. Build and development scripts in `package.json`
4. Service-specific API keys or credentials set as environment variables

These examples provide a comprehensive resource for developers looking to implement email functionality in their applications using React components and various email service providers.
