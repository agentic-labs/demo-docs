## High-level description
This directory contains a simple example of how to use the `react-email` library to create and send transactional emails with Resend. It includes a React component for a waitlist email template and a `package.json` file for managing dependencies and scripts.

## What does it do?
This code defines a reusable email template for a waitlist confirmation email. When someone joins a waitlist, this template can be used to send them a personalized email confirming their spot. The email is built using React components, making it easy to customize and maintain. The `react-email` library provides tools for previewing the email during development and exporting it for use with an email sending service like Resend.

## Entry points
The main entry point for understanding this code is the `emails/waitlist.tsx` file, which defines the React component for the waitlist email template. The `package.json` file is also important for understanding the project's dependencies and how to run the development server.

## Key Files
### emails/waitlist.tsx
This file defines a React component called `WaitlistEmail` that renders a waitlist confirmation email. It uses components from the `@react-email/components` library to structure the email and apply styles. The component takes a `name` prop to personalize the message for the recipient.

### package.json
This file defines the project's metadata, scripts, and dependencies. It includes scripts for running the development server (`npm run dev`) and exporting the email templates (`npm run export`). The `dependencies` section lists the required packages, including `@react-email/components` and `react-email`.

## Dependencies
- `@react-email/components`: Provides pre-built React components for creating email templates.
- `react-email`: Framework for building, testing, and sending emails using React.
