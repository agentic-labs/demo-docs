## High-level description
This code defines a React component for a waitlist email template. It uses the `@react-email/components` library to create a responsive email layout with a heading and a personalized message for users who have joined a waitlist.

## Symbols

### `WaitlistEmail`
#### Description
A React functional component that renders the email template for waitlist confirmation.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| name | string | The name of the recipient to be used in the personalized message |

#### Outputs
The component returns a JSX element representing the email structure.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses various components from `@react-email/components` to structure the email.
2. Applies custom styles defined as JavaScript objects for layout and typography.
3. Includes a preview text for email clients that support it.
4. Renders a heading and a personalized message using the provided `name` prop.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @react-email/components | Provides pre-built components for creating email templates |

## Styling
The component uses inline styles defined as JavaScript objects:

| Style Object | Purpose |
|:-------------|:--------|
| main | Defines the overall email body style |
| container | Sets the layout for the main content container |
| h1 | Styles the main heading |
| text | Styles the body text |

These styles create a dark-themed email with white and gray text, using a sans-serif font stack for compatibility across various email clients.

## Usage
This component is likely used in conjunction with an email sending service or API. The related file `examples/resend/src/pages/api/send.ts` shows an example of how this component might be used with the Resend email API:

```typescript
import { WaitlistEmail } from "../../../transactional/emails/waitlist";

// ... (in the API route handler)
const data = await resend.emails.send({
  from: "bu@resend.dev",
  to: "delivered@resend.dev",
  subject: "Waitlist",
  react: WaitlistEmail({ name: "Bu" }),
});
```

This demonstrates how the `WaitlistEmail` component is instantiated with a name prop and then passed to an email sending function.
