## High-level description
This code initializes and exports a Resend client instance using an API key from the environment variables. Resend is likely an email sending service, and this setup allows for easy integration of email functionality throughout the application.

## Symbols

### `resend`
#### Description
The `resend` constant is an instance of the `Resend` class, initialized with an API key. This instance provides access to Resend's email sending functionality.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| RESEND_API_KEY | string | The API key for authenticating with the Resend service, retrieved from environment variables |

#### Internal Logic
The code creates a new `Resend` instance using the API key stored in the `RESEND_API_KEY` environment variable. The `!` operator is used to assert that the API key is not `null` or `undefined`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| resend | Provides the `Resend` class for interacting with the Resend email service |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| RESEND_API_KEY | string | N/A | The API key for authenticating with the Resend service, must be set in the environment variables |

## References
The `resend` instance is used in other parts of the application, such as in the API route handler in `examples/resend/src/pages/api/send.ts`. In that file, it's used to send emails using the Resend service.

## Side Effects
This code relies on the presence of the `RESEND_API_KEY` environment variable. If this variable is not set or is invalid, it may cause runtime errors when attempting to use the Resend service.
