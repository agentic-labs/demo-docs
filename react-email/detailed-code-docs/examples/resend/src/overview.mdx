## High-level description
The `examples/resend/src` directory demonstrates how to integrate the Resend email service into a Next.js application. It provides a simple API endpoint for sending waitlist emails using a predefined template.

## What does it do?
This code sets up an API endpoint (`/api/send`) that allows users to send a pre-defined waitlist email. When a GET request is made to this endpoint, the code uses the Resend API to send the email and returns a success message to the user.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this example is the `pages/api/send.ts` file. This file defines the API route handler for the `/api/send` endpoint. It imports the `resend` client instance from `lib/resend.ts` and the `WaitlistEmail` component from the `transactional/emails/waitlist` directory.

Data flow:
1. A GET request is made to the `/api/send` endpoint.
2. The `send` function in `pages/api/send.ts` is executed.
3. The `send` function uses the `resend` client to send the waitlist email.
4. The response from the Resend API is returned to the client.

## Key Files

### `/lib/resend.ts`
This file initializes and exports a Resend client instance using an API key from the environment variables. This allows for easy integration of email functionality throughout the application.

```typescript
import { Resend } from 'resend';

const resend = new Resend(process.env.RESEND_API_KEY!);

export { resend };
```

### `/pages/api/send.ts`
This file defines the API endpoint for sending a waitlist email using the Resend email service. It handles GET requests, sends a predefined email template, and returns the response data or an error for unsupported HTTP methods.

```typescript
import { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next';
import { WaitlistEmail } from '../../../transactional/emails/waitlist';
import { resend } from '../../lib/resend';

export default async function send(
  req: NextApiRequest,
  res: NextApiResponse
) {
  const { method } = req;

  switch (method) {
    case 'GET':
      try {
        const data = await resend.emails.send({
          from: 'onboarding@resend.dev',
          to: 'demo@resend.dev',
          subject: `You're on the list! ðŸŽ‰`,
          react: WaitlistEmail({}),
        });
        res.status(200).json(data);
      } catch (error) {
        res.status(500).json({ error });
      }
      break;
    default:
      res.setHeader('Allow', ['GET']);
      res.status(405).end(`Method ${method} Not Allowed`);
  }
}
```

## Dependencies

- `resend`: Provides the `Resend` class for interacting with the Resend email service.
- `next`: Provides types for Next.js API routes.
- `@react-email/components`: Used in the `WaitlistEmail` component for building responsive email templates.

## Configuration
The code relies on the `RESEND_API_KEY` environment variable to authenticate with the Resend service. This variable must be set to a valid Resend API key for the email functionality to work correctly.
