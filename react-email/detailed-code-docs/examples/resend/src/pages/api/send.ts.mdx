## High-level description
This code defines an API endpoint for sending a waitlist email using the Resend email service. It handles GET requests, sends a predefined email template, and returns the response data or an error for unsupported HTTP methods.

## Code Structure
The main function `send` handles the API request and response. It uses the `resend` instance to send emails and the `WaitlistEmail` component to generate the email content.

## References
- `WaitlistEmail` from "../../../transactional/emails/waitlist"
- `resend` from "../../lib/resend"

### `send`
#### Description
An asynchronous function that handles the API request for sending a waitlist email.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| req | NextApiRequest | The incoming API request object |
| res | NextApiResponse | The API response object |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| res | NextApiResponse | The API response with status and data |

#### Internal Logic
1. Extracts the HTTP method from the request.
2. Uses a switch statement to handle different HTTP methods:
   - For GET requests:
     - Calls `resend.emails.send()` with predefined email details.
     - Returns the response data with a 200 status code.
   - For unsupported methods:
     - Sets the "Allow" header to ["GET"].
     - Returns a 405 status code with a "Method Not Allowed" message.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| next | For NextApiRequest and NextApiResponse types |
| @react-email/components | Used in the WaitlistEmail component (from related file) |
| Resend | Email sending service (from related file) |

## Configuration
The code uses environment variables for configuration:
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| RESEND_API_KEY | string | undefined | API key for the Resend service |

## API/Interface Reference
| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| /api/send | GET | None | JSON object with email send result | Sends a waitlist email |

## Performance Considerations
The email sending operation is asynchronous, which helps prevent blocking the main thread. However, the API response is synchronous, so the client will wait for the email to be sent before receiving a response.
