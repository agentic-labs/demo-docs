## High-level description
This directory contains an example implementation of integrating the Resend email service with a Next.js application. It demonstrates how to set up a simple API endpoint for sending waitlist emails using a predefined React email template.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory sets up a Next.js application with an API route that allows sending a waitlist confirmation email. When a GET request is made to the `/api/send` endpoint, the application uses the Resend API to send a pre-designed email template to a specified recipient. The email template is created using React components, making it easy to maintain and customize.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this example is the `pages/api/send.ts` file, which defines the API route handler for the `/api/send` endpoint. This file orchestrates the process of sending the email by:

1. Importing the Resend client instance from `lib/resend.ts`
2. Importing the `WaitlistEmail` component from the `transactional/emails/waitlist` directory
3. Handling the GET request and using the Resend client to send the email

## Key Files

### `/lib/resend.ts`
This file initializes and exports a Resend client instance using an API key from the environment variables:

```typescript
import { Resend } from 'resend';

const resend = new Resend(process.env.RESEND_API_KEY!);

export { resend };
```

### `/pages/api/send.ts`
This file defines the API endpoint for sending a waitlist email:

```typescript
import { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next';
import { WaitlistEmail } from '../../../transactional/emails/waitlist';
import { resend } from '../../lib/resend';

export default async function send(
  req: NextApiRequest,
  res: NextApiResponse
) {
  const { method } = req;

  switch (method) {
    case 'GET':
      try {
        const data = await resend.emails.send({
          from: 'onboarding@resend.dev',
          to: 'demo@resend.dev',
          subject: `You're on the list! ðŸŽ‰`,
          react: WaitlistEmail({}),
        });
        res.status(200).json(data);
      } catch (error) {
        res.status(500).json({ error });
      }
      break;
    default:
      res.setHeader('Allow', ['GET']);
      res.status(405).end(`Method ${method} Not Allowed`);
  }
}
```

### `/transactional/emails/waitlist.tsx`
This file contains the React component for the waitlist email template:

```typescript
import {
  Body,
  Container,
  Head,
  Heading,
  Html,
  Preview,
  Text,
} from '@react-email/components';
import * as React from 'react';

export const WaitlistEmail = ({ name = 'there' }) =&gt; (
  &lt;Html&gt;
    &lt;Head /&gt;
    &lt;Preview&gt;You're on the waitlist!&lt;/Preview&gt;
    &lt;Body style={main}&gt;
      &lt;Container style={container}&gt;
        &lt;Heading style={h1}&gt;You're on the list!&lt;/Heading&gt;
        &lt;Text style={text}&gt;
          Hey {name}, thanks for joining our waitlist. We'll let you know when
          we launch!
        &lt;/Text&gt;
      &lt;/Container&gt;
    &lt;/Body&gt;
  &lt;/Html&gt;
);

export default WaitlistEmail;

// Styles omitted for brevity
```

## Dependencies
- `next`: The Next.js framework for building React applications
- `react` and `react-dom`: Core React libraries
- `resend`: The Resend email service client
- `@react-email/components`: Provides pre-built React components for creating email templates
- `typescript`: For TypeScript support

## Configuration
The project uses TypeScript and is configured with a `tsconfig.json` file that sets up the compiler options for a Next.js project. The main configuration point is the `RESEND_API_KEY` environment variable, which must be set to a valid Resend API key for the email functionality to work correctly.

The `package.json` file defines the project's dependencies and scripts for building, developing, and starting the application:

```json
{
  "name": "react-email-with-resend",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "private": true,
  "scripts": {
    "build": "next build",
    "dev": "next dev",
    "start": "next start"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "next": "13.4.12",
    "react": "18.2.0",
    "react-dom": "18.2.0",
    "resend": "^3.2.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@types/node": "20.4.4",
    "@types/react": "18.2.15",
    "@types/react-dom": "18.2.7",
    "typescript": "5.1.6"
  }
}
```

This example demonstrates a simple yet effective way to integrate email functionality into a Next.js application using Resend and React Email components. It provides a foundation that can be easily extended to support more complex email scenarios and templates.
