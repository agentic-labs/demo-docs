## High-level description
This directory contains an example project demonstrating how to send emails using AWS Simple Email Service (SES) with React Email components. The project is set up as a TypeScript-based Node.js application, utilizing modern JavaScript features and React for creating email templates.

## What does it do?
The project showcases a workflow for sending HTML emails through AWS SES. It uses React components to build an email template, which includes a customizable button with a link. The main functionality involves:

1. Rendering a React component into an HTML email template.
2. Configuring and initializing an AWS SES client.
3. Sending the rendered email template using AWS SES.

The email recipient and button URL are passed as arguments to the script, allowing for dynamic content in the emails.

## Entry points
The main entry point of the application is `src/index.tsx`. This file orchestrates the email sending process by:

1. Initializing the AWS SES client with the specified region.
2. Rendering the email template defined in `src/email.tsx`.
3. Sending the email using the SES client.

The `src/email.tsx` file defines a reusable React component for the email template, which is used by the main entry point.

## Key Files

1. `src/index.tsx`:
   - Initializes the AWS SES client.
   - Renders the email template.
   - Sends the email using AWS SES.

2. `src/email.tsx`:
   - Defines a React component for the email template.
   - Uses `@react-email/components` to create the HTML structure.
   - Accepts a `url` prop for customizing the button link.

3. `package.json`:
   - Defines project metadata, dependencies, and scripts.
   - Specifies build and development scripts using `tsup`.

4. `tsconfig.json`:
   - Configures TypeScript compiler options.
   - Sets up modern JavaScript features and React JSX support.

## Dependencies
The project relies on the following key dependencies:

1. `@aws-sdk/client-ses` (v3.341.0):
   - Provides the AWS SDK for interacting with SES.
   - Used for sending emails through AWS SES.

2. `@react-email/components` (latest version):
   - Offers pre-built React components for creating email templates.
   - Used in `src/email.tsx` for structuring the email content.

3. `react` (v19.0.0-rc.0):
   - Core React library for building the email template components.

4. `tsup` (v6.2.3) and `typescript` (v4.8.3) (dev dependencies):
   - Used for building and bundling the TypeScript project.

## Configuration
The project uses the following configuration:

1. Environment Variables:
   - `AWS_SES_REGION`: Specifies the AWS region for SES.

2. TypeScript Configuration (`tsconfig.json`):
   - Enables strict type checking.
   - Configures JSX for React without requiring imports.
   - Sets the module system to ESNext and targets ES6.

3. Build Configuration (`package.json` scripts):
   - Uses `tsup` for building and bundling.
   - Generates both ESM and CommonJS outputs.
   - Excludes React from the bundle (external dependency).

4. ESLint Configuration (`.eslintrc.js`):
   - Extends a custom ESLint configuration.
   - Sets the root configuration to prevent looking for other configs.

This setup provides a streamlined example of integrating AWS SES with React Email components, demonstrating how to create and send dynamic HTML emails using modern web technologies.
