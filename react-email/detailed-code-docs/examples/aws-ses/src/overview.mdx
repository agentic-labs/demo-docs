## High-level description
This directory contains examples of how to send emails using AWS Simple Email Service (SES) and React. It showcases the integration of React Email components for building HTML email templates and the AWS SDK for JavaScript to interact with the SES service.

## What does it do?
This code demonstrates how to send a simple HTML email using AWS SES. It first renders a React component into an HTML email template. This template includes a button with a customizable link. Then, it uses the AWS SDK to configure and send the email via AWS SES. The configuration, including the sender's email address, recipient's email address, and AWS region, is managed through environment variables.

## Entry points
The main entry point is `index.tsx`. It initializes the AWS SES client, renders the email template, and sends the email. The `email.tsx` file defines a reusable React component for the email template.

## Key Files

### email.tsx
This file defines a React component that generates a simple HTML email template. The template includes a single button with a link that is passed as a prop to the component. This component is designed to be used with the `@react-email/components` library for rendering HTML emails in React applications.

### index.tsx
This file demonstrates how to use the AWS SDK for JavaScript to send emails via AWS SES. It initializes an SES client, renders an HTML email template using the `Email` component defined in `email.tsx`, and sends the email using the SES client. The recipient's email address and the URL for the button in the email are passed as arguments to the script.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Version | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `@aws-sdk/client-ses` | ^3.312.0 | Provides the necessary functions to interact with AWS SES. |
| `@react-email/components` | ^1.1.1 | Offers React components specifically designed for creating HTML email templates. |

## Configuration
The code relies on the following environment variable:

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `AWS_SES_REGION` | Specifies the AWS region where the SES service is located. |
