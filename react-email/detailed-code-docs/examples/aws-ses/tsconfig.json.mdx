## High-level description
This file is a TypeScript configuration file (tsconfig.json) for an AWS SES (Simple Email Service) example project. It specifies compiler options and file inclusion/exclusion patterns for TypeScript compilation, tailored for a modern web development environment with React support.

## Symbols

### compilerOptions
#### Description
This object contains various TypeScript compiler options that define how the TypeScript code should be compiled and what features should be enabled or disabled.

#### Internal Logic
The compiler options are set to enable modern JavaScript features, strict type checking, and React JSX support. Some key settings include:

- `esModuleInterop`: Enables interoperability between CommonJS and ES Modules.
- `strict`: Enables all strict type checking options.
- `jsx`: Set to "react-jsx" for React JSX support without importing React.
- `module`: Set to "ESNext" for the latest ECMAScript module support.
- `target`: Compiles to ECMAScript 2015 (ES6).
- `types`: Includes Vitest globals for testing.

### include
#### Description
Specifies which files or directories should be included in the compilation process.

#### Internal Logic
Set to `["."]`, which includes all TypeScript files in the current directory and its subdirectories.

### exclude
#### Description
Specifies which files or directories should be excluded from the compilation process.

#### Internal Logic
Excludes the following directories:
- `"dist"`: Typically used for compiled output.
- `"build"`: Another common directory for build output.
- `"node_modules"`: Excludes third-party dependencies.

## Dependencies
This configuration implies the use of the following dependencies:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| TypeScript | The primary language and compiler being configured |
| React | For JSX support in a React application |
| Vitest | For testing, as indicated by the inclusion of Vitest globals |

## Configuration
Key configuration options include:
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| strict | boolean | true | Enables all strict type checking options |
| jsx | string | "react-jsx" | Specifies JSX code generation for React without requiring React import |
| module | string | "ESNext" | Uses the latest ECMAScript module syntax |
| target | string | "es6" | Compiles to ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) |

This configuration is set up for a modern TypeScript project with React support and is optimized for development with strict type checking. It's tailored for an AWS SES example, suggesting that the project likely involves email-related functionality using Amazon's Simple Email Service.
