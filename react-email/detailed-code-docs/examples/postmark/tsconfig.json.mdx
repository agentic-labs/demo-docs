title: "tsconfig.json"

## High-level description
This file is a TypeScript configuration file (tsconfig.json) for a project using Postmark. It defines various compiler options to control how TypeScript compiles the code, ensuring type safety, module resolution, and other important aspects of the TypeScript development environment.

## Symbols

### compilerOptions
#### Description
This object contains various TypeScript compiler options that define how the TypeScript code should be compiled and checked.

#### Internal Logic
The compiler options are set to enable strict type checking, support modern JavaScript features, and configure the project for a React-based environment. Some key settings include:

- Enabling strict type checking (`"strict": true`)
- Supporting JSX for React (`"jsx": "react-jsx"`)
- Setting the target ECMAScript version (`"target": "es6"`)
- Configuring module resolution (`"moduleResolution": "node"`, `"module": "ESNext"`)
- Including type definitions for Vitest testing framework (`"types": ["vitest/globals"]`)

### include
#### Description
Specifies which files or directories should be included in the compilation process.

#### Internal Logic
It includes all files in the current directory and its subdirectories (`.`).

### exclude
#### Description
Specifies which files or directories should be excluded from the compilation process.

#### Internal Logic
It excludes the `dist`, `build`, and `node_modules` directories from compilation.

## Dependencies
This configuration implies the use of the following dependencies:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| TypeScript | The primary language and compiler being configured |
| React | Implied by the JSX configuration |
| Vitest | Testing framework, as indicated by the types inclusion |

## Configuration
Key configuration options defined in the file:
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| strict | boolean | true | Enables all strict type checking options |
| jsx | string | "react-jsx" | Specifies JSX code generation for React |
| target | string | "es6" | Sets the ECMAScript target version |
| module | string | "ESNext" | Specifies the module code generation method |
| lib | array | ["ESNext", "DOM", "DOM.Iterable"] | Specifies the library files to include in the compilation |

This configuration sets up a TypeScript environment suitable for a modern React project with strict type checking and support for ES6 features. It also includes settings for testing with Vitest and ensures proper module resolution for a Node.js environment.
