## High-level description
This directory contains a simple example of how to send emails using the Postmark service and React Email components. It showcases the process of rendering an email template with a clickable button and sending it to a specified recipient.

## What does it do?
The code defines a React component that renders a basic email template with a button. This template is then populated with a target URL and converted into HTML. The code then uses the Postmark API to send this HTML email to a specified recipient.

## Entry points
The main entry point is `index.tsx`. It performs the following actions:
1. Imports necessary dependencies, including the Postmark client, React Email components, and the custom `Email` component.
2. Initializes the Postmark client with the API key fetched from environment variables.
3. Renders the `Email` component, passing in a sample URL for the button.
4. Configures the email options, including sender, recipient, subject, and the rendered HTML content.
5. Sends the email using the Postmark client with the defined options.

## Key Files
### `email.tsx`
This file defines the `Email` React component. This component is responsible for rendering the structure and content of the email, including a clickable button that links to a provided URL. It uses `@react-email/components` for creating the email-specific HTML structure.

## Dependencies
- **@react-email/components:** Used for rendering React components into email-safe HTML.
- **postmark:** The official Postmark SDK for Node.js, used for interacting with the Postmark API to send emails.

## Configuration
The code relies on the `POSTMARK_API_KEY` environment variable for authenticating with the Postmark service. This key needs to be set in the environment before running the code.
