## High-level description
This directory contains an example implementation of sending emails using Postmark service with React Email components. It demonstrates how to create a simple email template, render it with React, and send it using the Postmark API.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory accomplishes the following:

1. Defines a React component (`Email`) that represents an email template with a clickable button.
2. Renders the email template into HTML format.
3. Initializes a Postmark client using an API key.
4. Configures email options including sender, recipient, subject, and HTML content.
5. Sends the email using the Postmark API.

This example showcases how to integrate React Email components with the Postmark service to create and send customized emails programmatically.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this example is `src/index.tsx`. This file orchestrates the entire process:

1. It imports necessary dependencies, including the Postmark client and React Email components.
2. Initializes the Postmark client with an API key from environment variables.
3. Renders the `Email` component with a sample URL.
4. Configures the email options.
5. Sends the email using the Postmark client.

The `src/email.tsx` file defines the `Email` React component, which structures the content of the email using `@react-email/components`.

## Dependencies
The project relies on the following key dependencies:

1. **@react-email/components** (version not specified): Provides React components specifically designed for creating email templates.
2. **postmark** (version not specified): The official Postmark SDK for Node.js, used to interact with the Postmark API for sending emails.
3. **react** (version not specified): The core React library for building the email template components.

## Configuration
The project uses the following configuration files:

1. `.eslintrc.js`: Configures ESLint for the project, extending a custom ESLint configuration.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  root: true,
  extends: ['custom'],
};
```

2. `tsconfig.json`: Configures TypeScript compiler options for the project.

Key compiler options include:
- Strict type checking enabled
- JSX support for React
- ES6 as the target
- Module resolution set to "node"
- Includes type definitions for Vitest testing framework

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true,
    "jsx": "react-jsx",
    "target": "es6",
    "module": "ESNext",
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "types": ["vitest/globals"],
    // ... other options
  },
  "include": ["."],
  "exclude": ["dist", "build", "node_modules"]
}
```

3. `package.json`: Defines project metadata, scripts, and dependencies.

Notable configurations:
- Project name: "react-email-with-postmark"
- Version: "1.0.0"
- License: MIT
- Private package (not to be published)
- Main entry point: "./dist/index.js"
- Module entry point: "./dist/index.mjs"
- TypeScript definitions: "./dist/index.d.ts"

Build scripts:
```json
"scripts": {
  "build": "tsup src/index.tsx --format esm,cjs --dts --external react",
  "dev": "tsup src/index.tsx --format esm,cjs --dts --external react --watch",
  "clean": "rm -rf dist"
}
```

The project also relies on the `POSTMARK_API_KEY` environment variable for authenticating with the Postmark service. This key must be set in the environment before running the code.

This example demonstrates a modern setup for creating and sending emails using React components and the Postmark service, with TypeScript for type safety and modern build tools for efficient development and packaging.
