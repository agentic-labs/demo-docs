## High-level description
This directory contains an example project demonstrating how to send emails using SendGrid within a React application. It showcases the integration of the SendGrid API with React components for building and sending email templates.

## What does it do?
The project provides a simple workflow for creating and sending emails:

1. It defines an email template using React components from the `@react-email/components` library.
2. The template is rendered into HTML.
3. The SendGrid API key is retrieved from environment variables.
4. The SendGrid library (`@sendgrid/mail`) is used to send an email containing the rendered HTML template, along with recipient and sender information.

This setup allows developers to create dynamic, React-based email templates and send them programmatically using SendGrid's email service.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this example is `src/index.tsx`. This file contains the core logic for rendering the email template and sending the email using SendGrid.

## Key Files
- `src/email.tsx`: Defines a React component that represents the structure and content of the email. It uses `@react-email/components` to construct an HTML-based email template with a clickable button linking to a provided URL.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @sendgrid/mail | SendGrid's official Node.js library for sending emails |
| @react-email/components | React components specifically designed for building email templates |
| react | Core React library for building user interfaces |
| tsup | A zero-config TypeScript bundler used for building the project |
| typescript | TypeScript compiler for static typing |

## Configuration
1. SendGrid API Key: The project retrieves the SendGrid API key from the `SENDGRID_API_KEY` environment variable. This key is crucial for authenticating with the SendGrid service to send emails.

2. TypeScript Configuration (`tsconfig.json`):
   - Targets ES6 and uses ESNext modules
   - Enables strict type checking
   - Configures JSX for React
   - Includes DOM and DOM.Iterable library types
   - Sets up module resolution for Node.js-style imports

3. ESLint Configuration (`.eslintrc.js`):
   - Sets the root configuration to true
   - Extends a custom ESLint configuration named 'custom'

4. Build Configuration (`package.json`):
   - Uses `tsup` for building, generating both CommonJS and ES module outputs
   - Provides scripts for building, development (with watch mode), and cleaning the dist directory

Here's an example of how the email sending logic might look in `src/index.tsx`:

```typescript
import { render } from '@react-email/render';
import sendgrid from '@sendgrid/mail';
import { Email } from './email';

sendgrid.setApiKey(process.env.SENDGRID_API_KEY);

const emailHtml = render(&lt;Email url="https://example.com" /&gt;);

const options = {
  from: 'you@example.com',
  to: 'user@gmail.com',
  subject: 'hello world',
  html: emailHtml,
};

sendgrid.send(options);
```

This example demonstrates how the project combines React components for email templates with SendGrid's email sending functionality, providing a powerful and flexible solution for programmatic email sending in a React environment.
