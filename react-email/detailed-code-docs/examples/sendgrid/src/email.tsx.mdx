### `Email`
#### Description
`Email` is a React functional component that creates an email template containing a clickable button. It uses the `Html` and `Button` components from the `@react-email/components` library to structure the email content.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| url | string | The URL that the button will link to when clicked |

#### Outputs
The component returns a React element representing the email template.

#### Internal Logic
1. The component receives a `url` prop through the `EmailProps` interface.
2. It renders an `Html` component with the `lang` attribute set to "en".
3. Inside the `Html` component, it renders a `Button` component with the `href` attribute set to the provided `url`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @react-email/components | Provides pre-built components (Html and Button) for creating email templates |

## References
This component likely interacts with other parts of a larger email sending system, possibly using libraries like `react-email` or `resend` (as seen in the `apps/web/package.json` file).

## Performance Considerations
The `Email` component is a simple, stateless component that should render quickly. However, the overall performance of the email sending system will depend on how this component is used and integrated with other parts of the application.

## API/Interface Reference
While not an API endpoint, this component can be considered part of a broader email template API:

| Component | Props | Description |
|:----------|:------|:------------|
| Email | { url: string } | Renders an email template with a clickable button linking to the provided URL |

Note: The actual usage of this component in an email sending system would depend on the implementation details of the surrounding application.
