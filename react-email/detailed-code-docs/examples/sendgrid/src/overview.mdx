## High-level description
This directory contains a simple example of how to send emails using the SendGrid API within a React application. It showcases the integration of the `@sendgrid/mail` library for email sending and `@react-email/components` for building the email template.

## What does it do?
The code first defines a basic email template with a clickable button using React components. This template is then rendered into HTML. The SendGrid API key is retrieved from environment variables. Finally, the code uses the SendGrid library to send an email. This email contains the rendered HTML template, a recipient address, a sender address, and a subject.

## Entry points
The main entry point is `src/index.tsx`. This file contains the logic for sending the email and rendering the email template.

## Key Files

- **`email.tsx`**: This file defines a React component that represents the structure and content of the email. It utilizes `@react-email/components` to construct an HTML-based email template with a button linking to a provided URL.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Version | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `@react-email/components` | N/A | Provides React components specifically designed for creating HTML email templates. |
| `@sendgrid/mail` |  N/A | Offers the necessary functions to interact with the SendGrid API for sending emails. |

## Configuration
The SendGrid API key is retrieved from the `SENDGRID_API_KEY` environment variable. This key is essential for authenticating with the SendGrid service to send emails.
