## High-level description
This directory contains example projects demonstrating how to send transactional emails using the Scaleway Transactional Email Manager (TEM) API. It includes two subdirectories: one for a Next.js application and another for a Node.js application. Both projects utilize TypeScript and React Email for creating and sending email templates.

## What does it do?
The examples in this directory showcase how to:

1. Set up a connection to Scaleway using API credentials.
2. Create email templates using React Email components.
3. Render the email templates and send them via the Scaleway TEM API.
4. Handle the email sending process through different application structures (Next.js API routes and Node.js scripts).

The Next.js example focuses on sending a "waitlist" email, while the Node.js example demonstrates sending a team invitation email. Both examples provide developers with practical implementations of integrating Scaleway's services with React-based email templates.

## Entry points
The main entry points for these examples are:

1. Next.js example:
   - `/pages/api/send.ts`: An API route that handles POST requests to trigger the email sending process.
   - `/transactional/send.ts`: A script demonstrating how to send the email directly using the Scaleway TEM API.

2. Node.js example:
   - `src/index.tsx`: The core functionality file that initializes the Scaleway client and executes the email sending process.

## Key Files
1. Next.js example:
   - `/lib/scaleway.ts`: Sets up the Scaleway API client.
   - `/transactional/emails/WaitlistEmail.tsx`: Defines the React component for the waitlist email.

2. Node.js example:
   - `src/email.tsx`: Defines the React-based structure and content of the invitation email.

## Dependencies
Both examples rely on similar key dependencies:

- `@scaleway/sdk`: Scaleway SDK for interacting with Scaleway services.
- `@react-email/components` and `@react-email/render`: Provide components and rendering capabilities for React Email.
- `react` and `react-dom`: React library and DOM rendering package.

The Next.js example additionally uses:
- `next`: Next.js framework for building React applications.
- `dotenv`: Loads environment variables from a `.env` file.

The Node.js example uses:
- `tsup`: A TypeScript-based bundler for building the project.

## Configuration
Both examples use environment variables for configuration:

- `ACCESS_KEY` or `accessKey`: Scaleway access key
- `SECRET_KEY` or `secretKey`: Scaleway secret key
- `PROJECT_ID` or `defaultProjectId`: Scaleway project ID

The Next.js example also uses:
- `EMAIL`: Recipient's email address (used in the `transactional/send.ts` script)

Both projects have TypeScript configurations tailored for their respective environments (Next.js and Node.js), with options set for compatibility and build performance.

These examples provide developers with clear demonstrations of how to integrate Scaleway's Transactional Email services with modern web technologies, showcasing best practices in TypeScript configuration, dependency management, and React-based email template creation.
