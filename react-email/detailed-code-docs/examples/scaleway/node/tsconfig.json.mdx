title: "tsconfig.json"

## High-level description
This file is a TypeScript configuration file (tsconfig.json) for a Node.js project. It specifies compiler options and other settings to control how TypeScript compiles the code in this project, particularly tailored for a React-based application with testing support.

## Configuration
The tsconfig.json file defines various compiler options to control TypeScript's behavior. Here's a breakdown of the key settings:

| Option | Type | Value | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------|:------------|
| composite | boolean | false | Disables project references feature |
| declaration | boolean | true | Generates corresponding .d.ts files |
| declarationMap | boolean | true | Generates sourcemap for .d.ts files |
| esModuleInterop | boolean | true | Enables interoperability between CommonJS and ES Modules |
| forceConsistentCasingInFileNames | boolean | true | Ensures consistent casing in file names |
| inlineSources | boolean | false | Does not inline source contents in sourcemaps |
| isolatedModules | boolean | true | Ensures each file can be safely transpiled without relying on other imports |
| moduleResolution | string | "node" | Uses Node.js-style module resolution |
| noUnusedLocals | boolean | false | Doesn't report errors on unused locals |
| noUnusedParameters | boolean | false | Doesn't report errors on unused parameters |
| preserveWatchOutput | boolean | true | Keeps outdated console output in watch mode |
| skipLibCheck | boolean | true | Skips type checking of declaration files |
| strict | boolean | true | Enables all strict type checking options |
| strictNullChecks | boolean | true | Enables strict null checks |
| jsx | string | "react-jsx" | Specifies JSX code generation for React |
| lib | array | ["ESNext", "DOM", "DOM.Iterable"] | Specifies library files to include in the compilation |
| module | string | "ESNext" | Uses ECMAScript modules |
| target | string | "es6" | Specifies ECMAScript target version |
| types | array | ["vitest/globals"] | Includes type definitions for Vitest testing framework |

The configuration also specifies:

- `"include": ["."]`: Includes all TypeScript files in the current directory and subdirectories.
- `"exclude": ["dist", "build", "node_modules"]`: Excludes specified directories from compilation.

This configuration is set up for a modern React application using TypeScript, with support for the Vitest testing framework. It enables strict type checking while allowing for some flexibility in unused variables and parameters. The setup is optimized for ES6+ development with full JSX support.
