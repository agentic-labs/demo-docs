## High-level description
This directory contains a Node.js example demonstrating how to send transactional emails using the Scaleway SDK and React Email components. It showcases setting up a Scaleway client, composing an email using React components for a team invitation, and sending the email through the Scaleway Transactional Email API.

## What does it do?
This code demonstrates sending a transactional email using Scaleway's services. It first sets up a connection to Scaleway using an API key and project information. Then, it defines the content of an email inviting a user to a team. This email content is built using React components for structure and styling. Finally, the code uses Scaleway's API to send the email to the specified recipient.

## Entry points
The main entry point is `index.tsx`. This file contains the logic for setting up the Scaleway client, defining the email content, and sending the email.

## Key Files

### src/email.tsx
This file defines a React component responsible for rendering the HTML structure and content of the invitation email. It utilizes components from the `@react-email/components` library to create a responsive and visually appealing email layout.

## Dependencies
- **@react-email/components:** Provides pre-built React components specifically designed for creating email templates. Used for structuring and styling the email content.
- **@scaleway/sdk:** The official Scaleway SDK for Node.js, enabling interaction with various Scaleway services, including the Transactional Email API.
- **react:** The core React library for building user interfaces. Used in this example for composing the email content as a React component.

## Configuration
The code relies on environment variables for configuration:
- **`accessKey`:** Your Scaleway access key for authentication.
- **`secretKey`:** Your Scaleway secret key for authentication.
- **`defaultProjectId`:** The ID of your Scaleway project.

```typescript
const client = new Scaleway({
  accessKey: process.env.accessKey,
  secretKey: process.env.secretKey,
  defaultProjectId: process.env.defaultProjectId,
  defaultRegion: "fr-par",
  defaultZone: "fr-par-1",
});
```
