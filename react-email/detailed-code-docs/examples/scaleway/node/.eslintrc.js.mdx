## High-level description
This file is an ESLint configuration file for a Node.js project in the Scaleway examples. It sets up the root ESLint configuration and extends a custom ESLint configuration.

## Symbols

### `module.exports`
#### Description
This is the main configuration object exported by the module. It defines the ESLint settings for the project.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| module.exports | Object | ESLint configuration object |

#### Internal Logic
The configuration object contains two properties:
1. `root: true`: This sets the current configuration as the root configuration. It prevents ESLint from searching for other configuration files in parent directories.
2. `extends: ['custom']`: This extends the configuration from a custom ESLint configuration named 'custom'.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| custom | A custom ESLint configuration that this project extends |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| root | boolean | true | Indicates that this is the root ESLint configuration |
| extends | array | ['custom'] | Specifies the configurations to extend from |

## Notes
1. The use of `root: true` is important as it prevents ESLint from merging this configuration with any other ESLint configurations that might exist in parent directories.
2. The 'custom' configuration being extended is not defined in this file. It should be available either as a local file in the project or as an npm package.
3. This configuration is minimal, relying heavily on the 'custom' configuration for specific linting rules and settings.
4. The file is using CommonJS module syntax (`module.exports`), which is typical for Node.js projects and ESLint configurations.
