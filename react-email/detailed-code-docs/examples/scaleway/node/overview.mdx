## High-level description
This directory contains a Node.js example project demonstrating how to send transactional emails using the Scaleway SDK and React Email components. The project is set up with TypeScript and ESLint, and uses modern JavaScript features and React for composing email content.

## What does it do?
The main functionality of this project is to create and send a transactional email, specifically a team invitation email. It accomplishes this by:

1. Setting up a connection to Scaleway using API credentials.
2. Defining the content of an email using React components for structure and styling.
3. Sending the email through Scaleway's Transactional Email API.

This example showcases how to integrate Scaleway's services with React-based email templates, providing a practical demonstration of creating visually appealing, responsive transactional emails programmatically.

## Entry points
The main entry point for the application logic is `src/index.tsx`. This file contains the core functionality:

- Initializing the Scaleway client with appropriate credentials and project settings.
- Importing and utilizing the email template defined in `src/email.tsx`.
- Executing the email sending process using Scaleway's API.

The `src/email.tsx` file is another key component, defining the React-based structure and content of the invitation email.

## Dependencies
The project relies on several external libraries:

1. **@scaleway/sdk** (version 1.4.0): Provides the Scaleway API client for interacting with Scaleway services, including the Transactional Email API.

2. **@react-email/components** (latest version): Offers pre-built React components specifically designed for creating email templates, enabling the creation of responsive and visually appealing email layouts.

3. **react** (version 19.0.0-rc.0): The core React library, used for composing the email content as React components.

4. **tsup** (version 6.2.3): A TypeScript-based bundler used for building the project.

5. **typescript** (version 4.8.3): Provides static typing and compilation for TypeScript code.

## Configuration
The project uses several configuration files:

1. **package.json**: Defines project metadata, scripts, and dependencies. Notable configurations include:
   - `"type": "module"`: Specifies that the project uses ES modules.
   - `"sideEffects": false`: Indicates that the package has no side effects, allowing for better tree-shaking.
   - Build scripts using `tsup` for both production and development builds.

2. **tsconfig.json**: Configures TypeScript compiler options, including:
   - Strict type checking enabled.
   - JSX support for React.
   - ES6 as the target JavaScript version.
   - Support for the Vitest testing framework.

3. **.eslintrc.js**: Sets up ESLint for code linting, extending a custom configuration.

4. Environment variables: The application expects the following environment variables for Scaleway authentication:
   - `accessKey`: Scaleway access key.
   - `secretKey`: Scaleway secret key.
   - `defaultProjectId`: Scaleway project ID.

These are used in the Scaleway client initialization:

```typescript
const client = new Scaleway({
  accessKey: process.env.accessKey,
  secretKey: process.env.secretKey,
  defaultProjectId: process.env.defaultProjectId,
  defaultRegion: "fr-par",
  defaultZone: "fr-par-1",
});
```

This project provides a comprehensive example of integrating Scaleway's services with modern web technologies to create and send transactional emails, demonstrating best practices in TypeScript configuration, dependency management, and React-based email template creation.
