## High-level description
This directory provides a basic example of how to use React Email to create and send transactional emails using the Scaleway Transactional Email Manager (TEM). It includes a simple waitlist email template and a script to send it.

## What does it do?
This code demonstrates how to build and send a transactional email using React Email and Scaleway TEM. The email template, written in React, thanks users for joining a waitlist and informs them that they will be notified when there's something new. The script `send.ts` handles rendering this template and sending it via Scaleway TEM.

## Entry points
The main entry point for developers is the `readme.md` file. It provides instructions on how to set up and run the example project. The `send.ts` file demonstrates how to send the email using Scaleway TEM.

## Key Files

### emails
This subdirectory contains the React Email project for the waitlist email template. It includes the template code (`WaitlistEmail.tsx`) and the project configuration (`package.json`).

### send.ts
This file demonstrates how to render the waitlist email template and send it using the Scaleway TEM API. It fetches the recipient's email address from an environment variable, renders the email template with the recipient's name, and sends the email using the Scaleway TEM client.
