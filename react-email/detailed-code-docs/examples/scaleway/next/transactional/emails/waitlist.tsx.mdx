### `WaitlistEmail`
#### Description
A React functional component that renders the structure and content of the waitlist email.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| name | string | The name of the recipient |

#### Outputs
The component returns a JSX structure representing the email content.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses various components from `@react-email/components` to structure the email.
2. Applies custom styles to different parts of the email.
3. Incorporates the recipient's name into the email content.

### Styling Constants
#### Description
Several constants (`main`, `container`, `h1`, `text`) are defined at the bottom of the file to provide styling for different parts of the email.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @react-email/components | Provides pre-built components for creating email templates |

## Related Code Context
The `WaitlistEmail` component is likely used in a larger system for sending emails to users who have joined a waitlist. The related file `send.ts` shows how this email template is rendered and sent using the Scaleway Transactional Email Manager (TEM).

## Performance Considerations
The use of inline styles and pre-defined style objects helps ensure consistent rendering across different email clients, which is crucial for email template design.

## API/Interface Reference
While not an API itself, this component is designed to be used as part of an email sending system. It expects a `name` prop to personalize the email content.

| Prop | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| name | string | The recipient's name to be included in the email content |

This email template component provides a reusable and customizable way to create waitlist notification emails, which can be easily integrated into a larger email sending system.
