## High-level description
This directory contains a Next.js application that demonstrates how to send transactional emails using the Scaleway Transactional Email Manager (TEM) API. The project is set up with TypeScript and React Email for creating and sending email templates.

## What does it do?
The application provides an API endpoint that, when triggered, sends a pre-defined "waitlist" email to a specified recipient. It showcases how to:

1. Create an email template using React Email components
2. Set up a Scaleway TEM client using the Scaleway SDK
3. Render the email template and send it via the Scaleway API
4. Handle the email sending process through a Next.js API route

## Entry points
The main entry points for this application are:

1. `/pages/api/send.ts`: This file defines an API route that handles POST requests to trigger the email sending process.
2. `/transactional/send.ts`: This script demonstrates how to send the email directly using the Scaleway TEM API.

The data flow is as follows:
1. A POST request is made to the `/api/send` endpoint.
2. The `send` function in `pages/api/send.ts` handles the request.
3. It uses the `scalewayTEM` client from `lib/scaleway.ts` to send the email.
4. The email content is defined using the `WaitlistEmail` component in the `transactional/emails` directory.

## Key Files

1. `/lib/scaleway.ts`: Sets up the Scaleway API client and initializes a Transactional Email API instance.

2. `/transactional/emails/WaitlistEmail.tsx`: Contains the React component that defines the structure and content of the waitlist email.

3. `/transactional/send.ts`: Demonstrates how to render the email template and send it using the Scaleway TEM API directly.

4. `next-env.d.ts`: Provides TypeScript declarations for Next.js and its image component.

## Dependencies
The project relies on several key dependencies:

- `@react-email/render` (latest version): Provides rendering capabilities for React Email components.
- `@scaleway/sdk` (latest version): Scaleway SDK for interacting with Scaleway services.
- `next` (latest version): Next.js framework for building React applications.
- `react` and `react-dom` (version 19.0.0-rc.0): React library and DOM rendering package.
- `@react-email/components`: Provides pre-built components for creating email templates.
- `react-email`: Framework for building and testing email templates using React.
- `dotenv`: Loads environment variables from a `.env` file.

## Configuration
The application uses environment variables for configuration:

- `ACCESS_KEY`: Scaleway access key
- `SECRET_KEY`: Scaleway secret key
- `PROJECT_ID`: Scaleway project ID
- `EMAIL`: Recipient's email address (used in the `transactional/send.ts` script)

The TypeScript configuration in `tsconfig.json` is set up for a Next.js project, with options tailored for compatibility and build performance.

This project demonstrates a practical implementation of sending transactional emails using React Email and Scaleway's services within a Next.js application, providing developers with a clear example of integrating these technologies.
