## High-level description
This directory contains an example implementation of sending emails using the MailerSend API integrated with React Email components. It demonstrates how to create a simple HTML email template with React and send it programmatically using MailerSend's service.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory accomplishes the following:

1. Defines a React component that represents an email template with a clickable button.
2. Renders this email template into HTML format.
3. Sets up a MailerSend client using an API key.
4. Configures email parameters such as sender, recipient, subject, and content.
5. Sends the rendered email template to a specified recipient using the MailerSend API.

This example showcases how to combine the power of React for creating dynamic email templates with the ease of sending emails through MailerSend's service.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this example is `src/index.tsx`. This file orchestrates the entire process:

1. It imports the necessary dependencies and the email template component.
2. Sets up the MailerSend client with an API key.
3. Renders the email template to HTML.
4. Configures the email details (sender, recipient, subject, content).
5. Sends the email using the MailerSend API.

The `src/email.tsx` file defines the React component for the email template itself, which is then imported and used in the main entry point.

## Dependencies
The project relies on two main external dependencies:

1. `@react-email/components` (version unspecified): This library provides pre-built React components specifically designed for creating HTML email templates. In this example, it's used for the `Html` and `Button` components in the email template.

2. `mailersend` (version ^2.0.0): This is the official MailerSend SDK for Node.js. It provides the `MailerSend` client and related classes for interacting with the MailerSend API to send emails.

3. `react` (version 19.0.0-rc.0): The core React library is used for creating the email template components.

## Configuration
The project uses the following configuration:

1. TypeScript Configuration (`tsconfig.json`):
   - Targets ES6
   - Uses React JSX syntax
   - Enables strict type checking
   - Includes type definitions for Vitest testing framework

2. ESLint Configuration (`.eslintrc.js`):
   - Extends a custom ESLint configuration
   - Sets the root configuration to true

3. Environment Variables:
   - The code relies on the `MAILERSEND_API_KEY` environment variable to authenticate with the MailerSend service. This API key must be set with a valid MailerSend API key for the code to function correctly.

4. Build Configuration (`package.json`):
   - Uses `tsup` for building the project
   - Outputs both CommonJS and ES module formats
   - Generates TypeScript declaration files

The `package.json` file also defines several npm scripts for building, developing, and cleaning the project:

```json
"scripts": {
  "build": "tsup src/index.tsx --format esm,cjs --dts --external react",
  "dev": "tsup src/index.tsx --format esm,cjs --dts --external react --watch",
  "clean": "rm -rf dist"
}
```

These scripts allow for easy development and production builds of the project.

In summary, this example demonstrates a practical implementation of sending custom React-based email templates using the MailerSend service, providing a starting point for developers looking to integrate similar functionality into their own projects.
