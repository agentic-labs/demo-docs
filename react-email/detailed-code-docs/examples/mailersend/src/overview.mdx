## High-level description
This directory contains a simple example of how to send emails using the MailerSend API and React Email components. It showcases creating a basic HTML email template with a clickable button and sending it to a recipient.

## What does it do?
The code defines a React component for an email template with a button that links to a provided URL. This template is then rendered into HTML and sent via the MailerSend API to a specified recipient. The sender's information, recipient's information, and email content are configured within the code.

## Entry points
The main entry point is `index.tsx`. It sets up the MailerSend client, renders the email template, configures the email parameters, and sends the email. The `email.tsx` file defines the React component for the email template itself.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `@react-email/components` | Provides pre-built React components for creating HTML email templates, including the `Html` and `Button` components used in this example. |
| `mailersend` | Provides the MailerSend client and related classes for interacting with the MailerSend API to send emails. |

## Configuration
The code relies on the `MAILERSEND_API_KEY` environment variable to authenticate with the MailerSend service. This API key needs to be set with a valid MailerSend API key for the code to function correctly.
