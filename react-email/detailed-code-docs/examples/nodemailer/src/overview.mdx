## High-level description
The `examples/nodemailer/src` directory contains a React application demonstrating how to send emails using the Nodemailer library. It showcases a simple email template and the process of configuring and using Nodemailer to send emails with custom content.

## What does it do?
This code sets up a Nodemailer transporter with specified SMTP credentials to send emails. It defines a React component for an email template with a clickable button. The code then renders this component into HTML and sends it as an email using the configured transporter. The email includes a recipient, subject, and the rendered HTML content.

## Entry points
The main entry point is `index.tsx`. It sets up the Nodemailer transporter, renders the email component, and sends the email.

1.  **`index.tsx`**:
    *   Imports necessary modules, including `nodemailer` for email sending and the `Email` component.
    *   Configures the Nodemailer transporter with SMTP credentials.
    *   Renders the `Email` component with a sample URL.
    *   Defines email options like sender, recipient, subject, and the rendered HTML content.
    *   Sends the email using the configured transporter and options.

2.  **`email.tsx`**:
    *   Defines a React functional component called `Email` that represents a simple email template.
    *   Uses `@react-email/components` to structure the email with a clickable button.
    *   Accepts a `url` prop to customize the button's link destination.

## Key Files

### `email.tsx`
This file defines a React component for a simple email template with a clickable button. It uses `@react-email/components` to structure the email content and accepts a `url` prop to customize the button's link.

```tsx
import { Button, Html } from '@react-email/components';
import React from 'react';

interface EmailProps {
  url: string;
}

const Email: React.FC&lt;EmailProps&gt; = ({ url }) =&gt; {
  return (
    &lt;Html lang="en"&gt;
      &lt;Button href={url}&gt;Click me&lt;/Button&gt;
    &lt;/Html&gt;
  );
};

export default Email;

```

## Dependencies

1.  **`@react-email/components`**: Provides pre-built React components for creating email templates, such as `Html` and `Button`.
2.  **`nodemailer`**: Enables sending emails from Node.js applications. It handles SMTP connection and email sending.
3.  **`React`**: Used for building the user interface and managing the component's state and lifecycle.

## Configuration
The code uses a configuration object for the SMTP transport in `index.tsx`:

```javascript
const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
  host: 'smtp.forwardemail.net',
  port: 465,
  secure: true,
  auth: {
    user: 'my_user',
    pass: 'my_password',
  },
});
```

*   **`host`**: SMTP server hostname.
*   **`port`**: SMTP server port.
*   **`secure`**: Whether to use a secure connection (TLS/SSL).
*   **`auth.user`**: SMTP authentication username.
*   **`auth.pass`**: SMTP authentication password.

**Important:** The code includes placeholder SMTP credentials. Replace `"my_user"` and `"my_password"` with actual credentials before running. Consider using environment variables to store sensitive information like passwords securely.
