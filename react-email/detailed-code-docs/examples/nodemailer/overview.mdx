## High-level description
This directory contains an example project demonstrating how to use Nodemailer with React Email components to create and send HTML emails. The project is set up with TypeScript support and uses modern JavaScript features and build tools.

## What does it do?
The project showcases a workflow for creating an email template using React components and sending it via Nodemailer. It includes:

1. A React component (`Email`) that defines the structure of an email with a clickable button.
2. A script that renders this email component into HTML.
3. Configuration for Nodemailer to send the rendered email using SMTP.

The main functionality is to take a URL as input, create an email with a clickable button linking to that URL, and send this email using Nodemailer.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this example is `src/index.tsx`. This file orchestrates the entire process:

1. It imports the necessary modules, including Nodemailer and the `Email` component.
2. Sets up a Nodemailer transporter with SMTP credentials.
3. Renders the `Email` component with a sample URL.
4. Defines email options including sender, recipient, subject, and the rendered HTML content.
5. Sends the email using the configured transporter and options.

The `Email` component is defined in `src/email.tsx`, which serves as a secondary entry point for understanding the email template structure.

## Key Files

1. `src/index.tsx`: The main script that ties everything together, rendering the email and sending it via Nodemailer.

2. `src/email.tsx`: Defines the React component for the email template. It uses `@react-email/components` to structure the email with a clickable button:

```tsx
import { Button, Html } from '@react-email/components';
import React from 'react';

interface EmailProps {
  url: string;
}

const Email: React.FC&lt;EmailProps&gt; = ({ url }) =&gt; {
  return (
    &lt;Html lang="en"&gt;
      &lt;Button href={url}&gt;Click me&lt;/Button&gt;
    &lt;/Html&gt;
  );
};

export default Email;
```

3. `package.json`: Defines the project structure, dependencies, and build scripts.

4. `tsconfig.json`: Configures TypeScript compilation options for the project.

## Dependencies
The project relies on several key dependencies:

1. `@react-email/components` (version not specified): Provides pre-built React components for creating email templates.
2. `nodemailer` (version not specified): Enables sending emails from Node.js applications.
3. `react` (version not specified): Used for building the user interface of the email template.
4. `tsup` (version 6.2.3): A TypeScript-based bundler used for building the project.
5. `typescript` (version 4.8.3): The TypeScript compiler.

## Configuration
The project uses several configuration files:

1. `.eslintrc.js`: Sets up ESLint with a custom configuration:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  root: true,
  extends: ['custom'],
};
```

2. `tsconfig.json`: Configures TypeScript compilation with options suitable for a modern React project, including strict type checking and JSX support.

3. Nodemailer configuration in `src/index.tsx`:

```javascript
const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
  host: 'smtp.forwardemail.net',
  port: 465,
  secure: true,
  auth: {
    user: 'my_user',
    pass: 'my_password',
  },
});
```

Note: The SMTP credentials in the code are placeholders. In a real-world scenario, these should be replaced with actual credentials, preferably stored in environment variables for security.

The `package.json` file also includes scripts for building and developing the project:

```json
"scripts": {
  "build": "tsup src/index.tsx --format esm,cjs --dts --external react",
  "dev": "tsup src/index.tsx --format esm,cjs --dts --external react --watch",
  "clean": "rm -rf dist"
}
```

These scripts use `tsup` to bundle the project, generating both ESM and CommonJS outputs, along with TypeScript declaration files.
