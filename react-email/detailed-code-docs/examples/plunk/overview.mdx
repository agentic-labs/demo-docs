## High-level description
This directory contains an example project demonstrating how to use the Plunk email service with React-based email templates. It showcases the integration between Plunk's Node.js client library and the `@react-email/components` library for creating and sending HTML emails.

## What does it do?
The project defines a React component that represents an email template with a clickable button. This template is rendered into HTML and sent as the body of an email using the Plunk API. The main functionality includes:

1. Creating a reusable email template as a React component.
2. Rendering the React component to HTML.
3. Sending the rendered HTML as an email using the Plunk API.

The email includes a customizable link that the recipient can click, demonstrating how to create interactive email content.

## Entry points
The main entry point of the project is `src/index.tsx`. This file orchestrates the email sending process by:

1. Importing the `Email` component from `email.tsx`.
2. Rendering the `Email` component to HTML using the `render` function from `@react-email/components`.
3. Using the Plunk API client to send the email with the rendered HTML content.

## Key Files
1. `src/index.tsx`: The main file that handles rendering the email template and sending it via Plunk.
2. `src/email.tsx`: Contains the `Email` React component that defines the structure and content of the email template.
3. `package.json`: Defines the project structure, dependencies, and build scripts.
4. `.eslintrc.js`: Configures ESLint for the project, extending a custom configuration.
5. `tsconfig.json`: Specifies TypeScript compiler options and project settings.

## Dependencies
The project relies on several key dependencies:

1. `@plunk/node` (version 1.1.1): Provides the Plunk API client for sending emails.
2. `@react-email/components` (latest version): Offers pre-built React components for creating email templates and includes the `render` function for server-side rendering.
3. `react` (version 19.0.0-rc.0): The core React library for building user interfaces.
4. `tsup` (version 6.2.3): A TypeScript-based bundler used for building the project.
5. `typescript` (version 4.8.3): The TypeScript compiler for static typing and compilation to JavaScript.

## Configuration
The project uses several configuration files:

1. `package.json`:
   - Defines scripts for building (`build`), development (`dev`), and cleaning (`clean`) the project.
   - Specifies the main entry points for CommonJS (`dist/index.js`) and ES modules (`dist/index.mjs`).
   - Sets the TypeScript declaration file location (`dist/index.d.ts`).

2. `.eslintrc.js`:
   - Sets up the root ESLint configuration.
   - Extends a custom ESLint configuration named 'custom'.

3. `tsconfig.json`:
   - Configures TypeScript compiler options for a React-based project with modern JavaScript features.
   - Enables strict type checking and React JSX support.
   - Includes type definitions for the Vitest testing framework.

The code expects the Plunk API key to be available in the `PLUNK_API_KEY` environment variable for authentication with the Plunk service when sending emails.

## Code Snippets
Here's a simplified example of how the email sending process works:

```typescript
import { render } from '@react-email/components';
import { Email } from './email';
import { Plunk } from '@plunk/node';

const plunk = new Plunk(process.env.PLUNK_API_KEY);

const html = render(&lt;Email url="https://example.com" /&gt;);

plunk.emails.send({
  to: 'recipient@example.com',
  subject: 'Welcome to Plunk!',
  body: html,
});
```

This example demonstrates the core functionality of rendering a React email template and sending it using the Plunk API.

In summary, this project serves as a practical example of how to create and send HTML emails using React components and the Plunk email service, showcasing modern JavaScript practices and efficient email template management.
