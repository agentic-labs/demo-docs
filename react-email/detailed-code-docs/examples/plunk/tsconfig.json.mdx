title: "tsconfig.json"

## High-level description
This file is a TypeScript configuration file (tsconfig.json) for a project named "plunk". It specifies compiler options and file inclusion/exclusion patterns for TypeScript compilation, tailored for a React-based project with modern JavaScript features and testing support.

## Symbols

### compilerOptions
#### Description
This object contains various TypeScript compiler options that define how the TypeScript code should be compiled and what features should be enabled or disabled.

#### Internal Logic
The compiler options are set to enable modern JavaScript features, strict type checking, and React JSX support. Some key settings include:

- `composite`: Set to false, disabling project references feature.
- `declaration` and `declarationMap`: Set to true, generating declaration files and source maps for declarations.
- `esModuleInterop`: Set to true, allowing default imports from CommonJS modules.
- `strict` and `strictNullChecks`: Set to true, enabling strict type checking.
- `jsx`: Set to "react-jsx", supporting React's JSX syntax without needing to import React.
- `lib`: Includes "ESNext", "DOM", and "DOM.Iterable", providing type definitions for modern JavaScript, DOM, and DOM iteration.
- `module`: Set to "ESNext", using the latest ECMAScript module syntax.
- `target`: Set to "es6", compiling to ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) syntax.
- `types`: Includes "vitest/globals", adding type definitions for Vitest testing framework.

### include
#### Description
Specifies which files or directories should be included in the compilation process.

#### Internal Logic
Set to `["."]`, which includes all TypeScript files in the current directory and its subdirectories.

### exclude
#### Description
Specifies which files or directories should be excluded from the compilation process.

#### Internal Logic
Excludes the following directories:
- `"dist"`: Typically used for compiled output.
- `"build"`: Another common directory for build output.
- `"node_modules"`: Standard directory for third-party dependencies.

## Dependencies
This configuration implies the use of the following dependencies:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| TypeScript | The primary language and compiler being configured |
| React | For JSX support in a React-based project |
| Vitest | Testing framework, as indicated by the types inclusion |

## Configuration
The `compilerOptions` object serves as the main configuration for the TypeScript compiler. Each option within it configures a specific aspect of the compilation process or type checking behavior.

## Error Handling
The configuration enables strict type checking (`"strict": true`, `"strictNullChecks": true`), which helps catch more errors during compilation. However, it allows unused locals and parameters (`"noUnusedLocals": false`, `"noUnusedParameters": false`), which might be useful during development but could be tightened for production code.

This configuration file sets up a TypeScript environment suitable for a modern React project with strong type checking and support for the latest ECMAScript features. It's optimized for development with allowances for unused variables, and includes support for the Vitest testing framework.
