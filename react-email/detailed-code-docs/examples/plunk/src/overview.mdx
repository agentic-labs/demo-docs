## High-level description
This directory contains a simple example of how to use the Plunk email service to send emails with React-based templates. It showcases the integration between Plunk's Node.js client library and the `@react-email/components` library for creating and sending HTML emails.

## What does it do?
The code defines a React component that represents an email template with a clickable button. This template is then rendered into HTML, which is sent as the body of an email using the Plunk API. The email includes a link that the recipient can click.

## Entry points
The main entry point is `index.tsx`. It imports the `Email` component from `email.tsx`, renders it to HTML, and then uses the Plunk API to send the email.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `@plunk/node` | Provides the Plunk API client for sending emails. |
| `@react-email/components` | Offers pre-built React components for creating email templates, including the `render` function for server-side rendering. |

## Configuration
The code expects the Plunk API key to be available in the `PLUNK_API_KEY` environment variable. This key is used to authenticate with the Plunk service when sending emails.
