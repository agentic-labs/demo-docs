## High-level description
This code defines a React component for rendering an email template with a clickable button. It utilizes the `@react-email/components` library to create a simple HTML structure with a button that links to a specified URL.

## Symbols

### `Email`
#### Description
`Email` is a React functional component that renders an HTML email template containing a clickable button. It uses the `Html` and `Button` components from the `@react-email/components` library to structure the email content.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| url | string | The URL that the button will link to when clicked |

#### Outputs
The component returns a JSX element representing the email template.

#### Internal Logic
1. The component takes a `url` prop through the `EmailProps` interface.
2. It renders an `Html` component with the `lang` attribute set to "en".
3. Inside the `Html` component, it renders a `Button` component with the `href` attribute set to the provided `url`.
4. The button displays the text "Click me".

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @react-email/components | Provides pre-built components (Html, Button) for creating email templates |

## References
The `Email` component uses the following components from `@react-email/components`:
- `Html`: Likely provides the basic HTML structure for the email.
- `Button`: Renders a clickable button element within the email.

## Notes
1. The component is designed to be type-safe, using TypeScript to define the props interface (`EmailProps`) and the component type (`React.FC&lt;Readonly&lt;EmailProps&gt;&gt;`).
2. The use of `Readonly` suggests that the component is designed to work with immutable props, which is a good practice in React.
3. The email template is very simple, containing only a button. In a real-world scenario, you might want to add more content or styling to create a more comprehensive email template.
4. The related `package.json` file indicates that this is part of a project using React and the `@react-email/components` library, confirming the setup we see in the code.
5. The `Button` component from `@react-email/components` likely handles the rendering of an HTML button or anchor tag suitable for email clients, but its exact implementation is not visible in the provided code.
