title: "tests.yml"

## High-level description
This YAML file defines a GitHub Actions workflow named "rsnd" for a project that uses Node.js and the pnpm package manager. The workflow consists of five jobs: `format`, `test`, `build`, `dependencies`, each triggered on push events to the `main` branch or on pull requests. These jobs aim to automate code formatting, testing, building, and dependency management.

## Code Structure
The code defines a single workflow named `rsnd` with five jobs: `format`, `test`, `build`, and `dependencies`. Each job runs on the `buildjet-4vcpu-ubuntu-2204` runner and uses a `node:18` container. The jobs share common steps for checking out the code, setting up pnpm, caching dependencies, and installing packages. The `format` job checks code formatting, the `test` job runs tests and linting, the `build` job builds the project, and the `dependencies` job ensures all dependencies are pinned to specific versions.

## Symbols

### `rsnd`
#### Description
This symbol represents the entire GitHub Actions workflow. It defines the triggers, jobs, and steps for the workflow.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a top-level workflow definition and doesn't accept direct inputs.

#### Outputs
N/A - The workflow itself doesn't produce direct outputs. It's designed to perform actions within the GitHub repository.

#### Internal Logic
The workflow is triggered on `push` events to the `main` branch and on `pull_request` events. It consists of five jobs:

*   **`format`**: This job checks the code formatting using `pnpm format:check`.
*   **`test`**: This job builds the project using `pnpm build`, runs linting using `pnpm lint`, and executes tests using `pnpm test`.
*   **`build`**: This job builds the project using `pnpm build`.
*   **`dependencies`**: This job ensures that all dependencies in `package.json` are pinned to specific versions. It uses a Node.js script to parse `package.json` and validate the version strings of dependencies and devDependencies.

All jobs share common steps:

*   Checkout the code using `actions/checkout@v4` or `actions/checkout@v3`.
*   Enable Corepack, prepare pnpm, and set the script shell to `/usr/bin/bash`.
*   Cache pnpm dependencies using `buildjet/cache@v3`.
*   Install packages using `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`.

#### Side Effects
*   The workflow will trigger on every push to the `main` branch and on every pull request.
*   It will execute the defined jobs and steps, potentially modifying the repository's content (e.g., by pushing changes if a job modifies the code).
*   The workflow will create logs and artifacts based on the execution of its jobs and steps.

#### Performance Considerations
*   The workflow uses `buildjet-4vcpu-ubuntu-2204` runners, which are relatively powerful and should provide reasonable performance.
*   Dependency caching using `buildjet/cache@v3` helps speed up subsequent runs by reusing previously downloaded dependencies.
*   The `--frozen-lockfile` flag used with `pnpm install` ensures that the dependency tree is not modified, further improving performance and consistency.

## Dependencies
This workflow relies on several GitHub Actions and a Node.js script:

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `actions/checkout@v4` | Checks out the repository's code. |
| `actions/checkout@v3` | Checks out the repository's code. |
| `buildjet/cache@v3` | Caches dependencies to speed up subsequent runs. |
| `node:18` | Provides the Node.js environment for running the workflow's steps. |
| `pnpm` | Used as the package manager for installing dependencies, running scripts, and managing the project. |
| Node.js script | Parses `package.json` and validates dependency versions in the `dependencies` job. |

## Error Handling
The workflow doesn't implement specific error handling beyond the default behavior of GitHub Actions. If a step within a job fails, the job will fail, and the workflow run will be marked as failed.

## Logging
The workflow relies on the default logging mechanisms provided by GitHub Actions. Each step within a job will generate logs that can be accessed through the GitHub Actions interface.

## TODOs
N/A - The code doesn't contain any explicit TODOs or notes indicating incomplete or planned work.
