## High-level description
This GitHub Actions workflow automates the process of bumping the project version and creating a release pull request when changes are pushed to the `main` branch. It utilizes `changesets` library to manage versioning and releases.

## Code Structure
The workflow defines a single job named `release` that runs on the latest Ubuntu environment. The job consists of several steps executed sequentially: checkout the repository, set up Node.js, enable pnpm, install dependencies, exit prerelease mode (if applicable), and create a release pull request using the `changesets/action`.

## Symbols

### `name: Bump`
#### Description
This section defines the name of the entire workflow, displayed as "Bump" on the Actions tab in the GitHub repository.

### `on: push`
#### Description
This section specifies the trigger for the workflow. It will be automatically triggered on every `push` event to the repository.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| branches | string | Specifies that the workflow should only be triggered on pushes to the `main` branch. |

### `concurrency`
#### Description
This section ensures that only one workflow run for this specific workflow is executed at a time, preventing concurrent runs for the same workflow and branch.

### `jobs: release`
#### Description
This section defines a single job named `release` within the workflow.

### `runs-on: ubuntu-latest`
#### Description
Specifies that the job should run on the latest available Ubuntu virtual environment provided by GitHub Actions.

### `steps`
#### Description
This section outlines the individual steps that will be executed sequentially within the `release` job.

### `name: Checkout Repo`
#### Description
This step checks out the repository's code using the `actions/checkout@v4` action, making the code accessible to subsequent steps.

### `name: Setup Node.js 20`
#### Description
This step sets up the Node.js environment using the `actions/setup-node@v3` action, specifying version 20.

### `name: Enable Corepack`
#### Description
This step enables Corepack, a Node.js feature for managing package managers, and configures pnpm as the active package manager.

### `name: pnpm Cache`
#### Description
This step sets up caching for the pnpm store using the `buildjet/cache@v3` action, speeding up subsequent workflow runs by reusing cached packages.

### `name: Install packages`
#### Description
This step installs the project dependencies using `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`, ensuring that only the packages specified in the lockfile are installed.

### `name: Exit prerelease mode`
#### Description
This step attempts to exit the prerelease mode using `pnpm canary:exit`. It has a `continue-on-error` flag set to `true`, meaning the workflow will continue even if this step fails. This is useful for handling cases where the project is not in prerelease mode.

### `name: Create Release Pull Request`
#### Description
This step utilizes the `changesets/action@v1` action to automate the creation of a release pull request. It determines the new version using `pnpm run version` and sets the pull request title to "chore: Bump for release". The `GITHUB_TOKEN` secret is used to authenticate with the GitHub API.
