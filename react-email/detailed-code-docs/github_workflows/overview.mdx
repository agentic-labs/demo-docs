## High-level description
This directory contains GitHub Actions workflows for automating various processes in the project's development lifecycle. The workflows handle version bumping, release management, and continuous integration tasks such as formatting, testing, building, and dependency management.

## What does it do?
The workflows in this directory automate several key processes:

1. Bump Canary: Automatically updates the package version and creates a release pull request when changes are pushed to the `canary` branch, managing pre-release versions.

2. Bump Stable: Similar to Bump Canary, but for the `main` branch. It creates release pull requests for stable versions.

3. Tests: Runs a comprehensive set of checks including code formatting, testing, building, and dependency management. This workflow is triggered on pushes to the `main` branch and on pull requests.

These workflows help maintain code quality, ensure consistent versioning, and streamline the release process.

## Key Files

### bump-canary.yml
This workflow is triggered on pushes to the `canary` branch. It performs the following steps:
1. Checks out the repository
2. Sets up Node.js 20
3. Enables Corepack and configures pnpm
4. Installs dependencies
5. Enters prerelease mode (allowed to fail)
6. Creates a release pull request with bumped version and release notes

### bump-stable.yml
Similar to `bump-canary.yml`, but triggered on pushes to the `main` branch. Key differences include:
1. Attempts to exit prerelease mode
2. Creates a release pull request for stable versions

### tests.yml
This workflow runs on pushes to `main` and on pull requests. It includes four main jobs:
1. `format`: Checks code formatting
2. `test`: Builds the project, runs linting, and executes tests
3. `build`: Builds the project
4. `dependencies`: Ensures all dependencies in `package.json` are pinned to specific versions

## Dependencies
The workflows rely on several GitHub Actions:

1. `actions/checkout`: Used to check out the repository code
2. `actions/setup-node`: Sets up the Node.js environment
3. `buildjet/cache`: Caches dependencies to speed up workflows
4. `changesets/action`: Automates version bumping and release creation

Additionally, the project uses pnpm as its package manager.

## Configuration
The workflows use the following configuration:

1. Node.js version: 20 (for bump workflows) and 18 (for tests workflow)
2. Runner: `ubuntu-latest` for bump workflows, `buildjet-4vcpu-ubuntu-2204` for tests workflow
3. `GITHUB_TOKEN` secret: Used for authentication in creating release pull requests

Environment variables and script commands are used to manage the workflow execution, such as `pnpm canary:enter` and `pnpm canary:exit` for managing prerelease mode.

These workflows provide a robust automation setup for the project, ensuring code quality and streamlining the release process across different branches.
