## High-level description
This GitHub Actions workflow automates the process of bumping the package version and creating a release pull request when changes are pushed to the `canary` branch. It utilizes pnpm's canary features to manage pre-release versions.

## Code Structure
The workflow defines a single job named `release` which runs on the latest Ubuntu environment. The job consists of several steps executed sequentially: checkout the repository, set up Node.js, enable Corepack and pnpm, install dependencies, enter prerelease mode, and finally create a release pull request using the `changesets` action.

### `bump-canary.yml`
#### Description
This YAML file defines a GitHub Actions workflow named "Bump canary" that automates the process of bumping the package version and creating a release pull request when changes are pushed to the `canary` branch.

#### Inputs
This workflow is triggered on `push` events to the `canary` branch.

#### Outputs
The workflow outputs a pull request to the repository with the bumped version number and release notes.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Checkout Repo:** Checks out the repository's code.
2. **Setup Node.js 20:** Sets up Node.js version 20.
3. **Enable Corepack:** Enables Corepack and configures pnpm.
4. **pnpm Cache:** Caches pnpm store to speed up subsequent runs.
5. **Install packages:** Installs project dependencies using `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`.
6. **Enter prerelease mode:** Enters prerelease mode using `pnpm canary:enter`. This step is allowed to fail as it might not always be necessary.
7. **Create Release Pull Request:** Uses the `changesets/action` to create a pull request with the bumped version and release notes. It retrieves the version using `pnpm run version` and uses the `GITHUB_TOKEN` secret for authentication.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| actions/checkout@v4 | Checks out the repository's code. |
| actions/setup-node@v3 | Sets up a specific Node.js version. |
| buildjet/cache@v3 | Caches dependencies to speed up workflows. |
| changesets/action@v1 | Automates creating release pull requests with version bumps and changelogs. |

## Configuration
This workflow uses the `GITHUB_TOKEN` secret for authenticating with GitHub API to create the release pull request.
