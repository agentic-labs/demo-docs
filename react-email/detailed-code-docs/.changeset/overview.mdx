## High-level description
The `.changeset` directory houses the configuration and supporting files for the Changesets tool within the project. Changesets is responsible for managing versioning, changelog generation, and package releases, particularly within a monorepo structure. This directory plays a crucial role in automating and streamlining the release process.

## What does it do?
This directory acts as the control center for managing changes and releases within the project's codebase. When a developer makes changes to the code and wants to release those changes, they use the Changesets tool. This tool interacts with the configuration file in this directory (`config.json`) to determine how to version the packages, update the changelog, and publish the updated packages. 

For example, if a developer fixes a bug in a package and wants to release that fix, they would use Changesets to:

1.  **Bump the package version:** Changesets will determine the appropriate version bump (major, minor, or patch) based on the type of change and the project's versioning strategy.
2.  **Update the changelog:** Changesets will automatically update the changelog with information about the fix, making it easy for others to see what has changed.
3.  **Publish the package:** Changesets will publish the updated package to the designated package registry (e.g., npm), making it available for others to use.

## Key Files
### config.json
This file contains the configuration settings for the Changesets tool. It defines how Changesets should handle various aspects of the release process, such as:

*   **Changelog generation:** Specifies the tool used to generate the changelog.
*   **Version bumping:** Defines how package versions should be bumped (e.g., automatically or manually).
*   **Package grouping:** Allows grouping packages that should always be released together.
*   **Publish settings:** Specifies the access level (public or private) for published packages.

For instance, the `config.json` file might specify that the project uses the default Changesets CLI for changelog generation, that certain packages should always be versioned together, and that all packages should be published with public access on npm.
