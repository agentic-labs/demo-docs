## High-level description
This file configures Vitest, a testing framework for JavaScript and TypeScript projects. It sets up global test settings and specifies the testing environment to be used.

## Symbols

### `defineConfig`
#### Description
`defineConfig` is a function imported from "vitest/config" used to define the configuration for Vitest. It takes an object as an argument, which specifies various testing options.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| config | Object | An object containing Vitest configuration options |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| config | Object | A Vitest configuration object |

### Configuration
The configuration object passed to `defineConfig` sets up the following options:

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| test.globals | boolean | true | Enables global test functions without importing them |
| test.environment | string | "happy-dom" | Specifies the testing environment to use |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| vitest | Testing framework for JavaScript and TypeScript projects |
| happy-dom | Simulates a browser environment for testing |

## Notes
1. The file starts with a triple-slash directive `/// &lt;reference types="vitest" /&gt;`, which provides type information for Vitest in TypeScript projects.
2. The configuration uses "happy-dom" as the testing environment, which is a lightweight browser simulation for testing purposes.
3. The `globals: true` setting allows the use of Vitest's global functions (like `describe`, `it`, `expect`) without explicitly importing them in test files.

This configuration file sets up a basic environment for running Vitest tests with global functions enabled and using a simulated DOM environment, which is particularly useful for testing frontend applications or components that interact with the DOM.
