#### Internal Logic
1. Specifies the JSON schema for validation.
2. Extends the base configuration.
3. Sets a custom schedule for running updates.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Renovate | Automated dependency updating tool |

### Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|

## Detailed Explanation

1. `"$schema"`: This field points to the JSON schema for Renovate configuration. It helps with validation and provides autocompletion in compatible editors.

2. `"extends"`: This array specifies which preset configurations to use. In this case, it's using `"config:base"`, which is Renovate's default base configuration. This includes a set of recommended default settings.

3. `"schedule"`: This array defines when Renovate should run its update checks. The schedule is set to `"before 3am on the first day of the month"`, meaning Renovate will run its checks once a month, specifically before 3 AM on the first day of each month.

This configuration ensures that dependency updates are checked regularly but not too frequently, which can be beneficial for projects that want to maintain stability while still keeping dependencies up-to-date. The early morning schedule minimizes potential disruptions to development work.
