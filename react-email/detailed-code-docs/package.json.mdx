title: "package.json"
---

## High-level description
This `package.json` file defines the configuration and dependencies for a React Email monorepo project. It includes scripts for building, developing, testing, and releasing the project, as well as managing dependencies and development tools.

## Code Structure
The file is structured as a standard `package.json`, containing metadata about the project, scripts, dependencies, and package manager configurations.

## Symbols

### Scripts
#### Description
Defines various npm scripts for managing the project lifecycle.

#### Internal Logic
- `build`: Builds all packages except `react-email-starter`
- `dev`: Runs development mode for all packages except `react-email-starter`
- `format`: Formats code using Prettier
- `format:check`: Checks code formatting without making changes
- `release`: Builds packages and publishes changes
- `canary:enter` and `canary:exit`: Manages canary releases
- `version`: Updates package versions and reinstalls dependencies
- `lint`: Runs linting across the project
- `test` and `test:watch`: Runs tests, with an option for watch mode

### devDependencies
#### Description
Lists the development dependencies required for the project.

#### Internal Logic
Includes tools for:
- Change management (@changesets/cli)
- TypeScript support (@types/node, @types/react, @types/react-dom)
- Linting and formatting (eslint, prettier)
- Building and testing (tsup, turbo, vite, vitest)
- DOM simulation (happy-dom)

### packageManager
#### Description
Specifies the package manager and version used for the project.

#### Internal Logic
Uses pnpm version 9.1.2

### pnpm
#### Description
Configures pnpm-specific settings.

#### Internal Logic
- `overrides`: Specifies custom versions for React types
- `patchedDependencies`: Lists patched dependencies with their corresponding patch files

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| turbo | Monorepo management and task running |
| pnpm | Package management |
| @changesets/cli | Managing package versions and changelogs |
| eslint | Code linting |
| prettier | Code formatting |
| tsup | TypeScript build tool |
| vite | Frontend build tool |
| vitest | Testing framework |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| name | string | "react-email-monorepo" | Project name |
| version | string | "0.0.0" | Project version |
| private | boolean | true | Indicates the package is private |

## Performance Considerations
The use of Turbo for task running and pnpm for package management suggests an emphasis on build and dependency management performance in a monorepo structure.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code, but the use of canary releases and changesets suggests an active development process with potential for future updates and releases.
