## High-level description
This `pnpm-workspace.yaml` file defines the workspace configuration for a pnpm-based monorepo project. It specifies the directory structure and locations of various packages and applications within the project.

## Symbols

### `packages`
#### Description
The `packages` key is an array that lists the locations of all the packages and applications that are part of this pnpm workspace. It uses glob patterns to define these locations.

#### Internal Logic
The file uses glob patterns to specify different types of packages and their locations:
1. Specific application directories: `"apps/web"` and `"apps/demo"`
2. All packages in the `packages` directory: `"packages/*"`
3. A specific template directory: `"packages/create-email/template"`
4. All benchmarks in the `benchmarks` directory: `"benchmarks/*"`

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| pnpm | Package manager that uses this workspace configuration |

## Configuration
This file serves as a configuration for the pnpm workspace. It defines the structure of the monorepo, allowing pnpm to manage dependencies and scripts across multiple packages efficiently.

| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| packages | array of strings | Specifies the locations of packages and applications in the workspace |

## API/Interface Reference
While not an API in the traditional sense, this configuration file serves as an interface for pnpm to understand the project structure:

| Path Pattern | Description |
|:-------------|:------------|
| apps/web | Specific web application |
| apps/demo | Specific demo application |
| packages/* | All packages in the packages directory |
| packages/create-email/template | Specific template for email creation |
| benchmarks/* | All benchmark packages or applications |

This configuration allows pnpm to manage these packages as part of a single workspace, enabling efficient dependency management and script running across the entire project.
