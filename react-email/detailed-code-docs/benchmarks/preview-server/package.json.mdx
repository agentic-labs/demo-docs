### Package Information
#### Description
The package is named "@benchmarks/preview-server" and is marked as private with version 0.0.0. It's licensed under MIT and is part of a larger repository hosted on GitHub.

### Scripts
#### Description
Two scripts are defined for running benchmarks:

1. `local-vs-2.1.7-canary.2`: Runs a benchmark comparing the local version against react-email@2.1.7-canary.2
2. `local-vs-2.1.7-canary.2-on-startup`: Runs a similar benchmark, likely focusing on startup performance

Both scripts use `tsx` to execute TypeScript files located in the `./src` directory.

### Dependencies
#### Description
The project has the following runtime dependencies:

| Dependency | Version | Description |
|:-----------|:--------|:------------|
| react-email | workspace:* | Local version of react-email |
| react-email-canary | npm:react-email@2.1.7-canary.2 | Specific canary version for comparison |
| tinybench | 2.5.1 | Likely used for running the benchmarks |

### DevDependencies
#### Description
Development dependencies include:

| Dependency | Version | Description |
|:-----------|:--------|:------------|
| eslint-config-custom | workspace:* | Custom ESLint configuration |
| tsconfig | workspace:* | TypeScript configuration |
| tsx | 4.7.1 | TypeScript execution engine |
| typescript | 5.1.6 | TypeScript compiler |

### Engine Requirements
#### Description
The project requires Node.js version 18.0.0 or higher.
