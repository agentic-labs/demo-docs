## High-level description
This code defines a function `runServerAndFetchPreviewPage` that starts a Node.js server using a provided CLI script, waits for the server to be ready, fetches a specific preview page, and then terminates the server. It's designed to be used in benchmarking or testing scenarios for a React Email application.

## Symbols

### `runServerAndFetchPreviewPage`
#### Description
This function spawns a Node.js child process to run a development server, monitors its output to determine when it's ready, fetches a specific preview page, and then terminates the server.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| pathToCliScript | string | The path to the CLI script that starts the development server |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise&lt;void&gt; | Promise | A promise that resolves when the preview page is successfully fetched, or rejects if there's an error |

#### Internal Logic
1. Spawns a Node.js child process using the provided CLI script with the "dev" argument.
2. Sets the working directory to a specific demo app location.
3. Listens to the stdout of the child process for a message indicating the server is running.
4. Extracts the server URL using a regular expression.
5. Fetches a specific preview page from the server.
6. Terminates the server process and resolves or rejects the promise based on the fetch result.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| node:path | Used for resolving file paths |
| node:child_process | Used to spawn the Node.js child process |

## Error Handling
The function includes basic error handling:
- If the server URL cannot be extracted from the stdout, it rejects the promise with a custom error message.
- If the fetch request fails, it rejects the promise.

## Performance Considerations
This function is likely used in benchmarking scenarios, as evidenced by the related file. It's designed to measure the startup time and initial page load of a React Email server, which is crucial for performance testing.

## References
The `runServerAndFetchPreviewPage` function is used in the related file `local-vs-2.1.7-canary.2-on-startup.ts` for benchmarking purposes. In that file, it's used to compare the startup performance of a local version of the server against a specific canary version.
