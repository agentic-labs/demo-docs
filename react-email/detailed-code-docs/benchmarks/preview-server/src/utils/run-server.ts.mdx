## High-level description
This code defines a utility function `runServer` that spawns a Node.js child process to run a CLI script, typically for starting a preview server. It monitors the server's output to extract the URL where the server is running and returns a Promise that resolves with the server details.

## Symbols

### `runServer`
#### Description
This function starts a Node.js child process to run a specified CLI script and returns a Promise that resolves with the server details once the server is running.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| pathToCliScript | string | The path to the CLI script to be executed |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise&lt;Server&gt; | Promise | A promise that resolves to a Server object containing the subprocess and URL |

#### Internal Logic
1. Spawns a Node.js child process using the provided CLI script path.
2. Sets the working directory to a specific demo app location.
3. Listens to the stdout of the child process.
4. Parses the output to find the server URL.
5. Resolves the promise with the server details when the URL is found.
6. Rejects the promise with an error if the URL is not found in the expected format.

## Side Effects
- Spawns a child process
- Modifies the current working directory for the child process

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| node:path | For resolving file paths |
| node:child_process | For spawning child processes |

## Error Handling
The function includes basic error handling:
- If the expected URL is not found in the server output, it kills the child process and rejects the promise with a detailed error message.

## Interfaces

### `Server`
#### Description
An interface that represents the running server.

#### Properties
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| subprocess | ChildProcessWithoutNullStreams | The Node.js child process running the server |
| url | string | The URL where the server is accessible |

## Performance Considerations
- The function uses a TextDecoder for efficient decoding of the child process output.
- It immediately resolves the promise once the server URL is found, without waiting for the entire server startup process to complete.

## References
The `runServer` function is used in other parts of the codebase, specifically in benchmark scripts:
- `local-vs-2.1.7-canary.2-on-startup.ts`
- `local-vs-2.1.7-canary.2.ts`

These scripts use `runServer` to start local and canary versions of a server for performance comparison.
