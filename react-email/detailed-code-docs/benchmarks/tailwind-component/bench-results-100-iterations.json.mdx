## High-level description
This JSON file contains benchmark results for two different operations, likely related to Tailwind CSS component generation. The file presents performance metrics for 100 iterations of each operation, including timing statistics and distribution information.

## Code Structure
The file contains a JSON array with two objects, each representing a set of benchmark results for different operations.

## Symbols

### Benchmark Result Object
#### Description
Each object in the array represents the results of a benchmark test, containing various statistical measures of performance over 100 iterations.

#### Inputs
N/A (This is a data structure, not a function)

#### Outputs
N/A (This is a data structure, not a function)

#### Internal Logic
The object contains the following key performance metrics:
- `totalTime`: Total time taken for all iterations (in milliseconds)
- `min`: Minimum time for a single iteration
- `max`: Maximum time for a single iteration
- `hz`: Operations per second
- `period`: Average time per operation (in milliseconds)
- `samples`: Array of 100 individual iteration times
- `mean`: Average time across all iterations
- `variance`: Statistical variance of the samples
- `sd`: Standard deviation
- `sem`: Standard error of the mean
- `df`: Degrees of freedom (99, as there are 100 samples)
- `critical`: Critical value (likely for confidence interval calculation)
- `moe`: Margin of error
- `rme`: Relative margin of error (as a percentage)
- `p75`: 75th percentile
- `p99`: 99th percentile
- `p995`: 99.5th percentile
- `p999`: 99.9th percentile

## Performance Considerations
The file contains two benchmark results with significantly different performance characteristics:

1. First operation:
   - Mean execution time: ~120.39 ms
   - Operations per second: ~8.31 Hz

2. Second operation:
   - Mean execution time: ~3326.38 ms
   - Operations per second: ~0.30 Hz

The second operation is significantly slower, taking about 27.6 times longer on average than the first operation.

## Dependencies
This file does not directly reference any dependencies. It is a data file containing benchmark results.

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration options in this file. However, the benchmark was run with 100 iterations, as evident from the sample size and the filename.
