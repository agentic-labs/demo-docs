## High-level description
This code is part of a benchmark for a Tailwind component in a React Email project. It renders an email template using the `@react-email/render` library and a Tailwind component from `@react-email/tailwind`.

## Code Structure
The code imports necessary functions and components, then renders an email template with Tailwind styling.

## Symbols

### `render`
#### Description
A function imported from `@react-email/render` used to render React components as email HTML.

### `CurrentTailwind`
#### Description
A component imported from `@react-email/tailwind` that provides Tailwind CSS functionality for email templates.

### `EmailWithTailwind`
#### Description
An imported email template component that uses Tailwind CSS for styling.

### Anonymous Async Function
#### Description
The main function of the script that renders the email template.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls the `EmailWithTailwind` function, passing `CurrentTailwind` as a prop.
2. Passes the result to the `render` function to generate the email HTML.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @react-email/render | Provides the `render` function for converting React components to email HTML |
| @react-email/tailwind | Provides the `Tailwind` component for applying Tailwind CSS in email templates |

## References
The code references the `EmailWithTailwind` component, which is imported from "./emails/with-tailwind.js". This component is defined in the related code snippet and represents a Google Play Policy Update email template styled with Tailwind CSS.

## Notes
1. The code uses top-level await, indicating it's meant to be run in an environment that supports ECMAScript modules (ESM).
2. The `EmailWithTailwind` component expects a `Tailwind` prop, which is provided by passing `CurrentTailwind`.
3. The actual email content and styling are defined in the `GooglePlayPolicyUpdateEmailWithTailwind` component within the related code snippet.
4. The related code snippet shows extensive use of React Email components and Tailwind CSS classes to structure and style the email template.

This code serves as a benchmark to test the rendering performance and functionality of a Tailwind-styled email template using the React Email library.
