## High-level description
This directory contains benchmarks for the `@react-email/tailwind` component, comparing its performance against different versions and against rendering without Tailwind CSS. It uses the `tinybench` library to run the benchmarks and outputs the results to the console and JSON files. The directory also includes the email templates used in the benchmarks, both with and without Tailwind CSS styling.

## What does it do?
This directory provides a suite of benchmarks to measure the performance of the `@react-email/tailwind` component. It compares the rendering time of email templates using different versions of the component, as well as against rendering without Tailwind CSS. This allows developers to track performance improvements and regressions across versions and understand the overhead of using Tailwind CSS in their email templates.

## Entry points
The main entry points are the benchmark scripts:

- `benchmark-0.0.12-vs-local-version.ts`: Compares the performance of version 0.0.12 of the Tailwind component against the local version.
- `benchmark-0.0.15-vs-local-version.ts`: Compares the performance of version 0.0.15 of the Tailwind component against the local version.
- `benchmark-with-vs-without.ts`: Compares the performance of rendering an email template with and without Tailwind CSS.

Each script sets up a benchmark using the `tinybench` library, runs the benchmark, and outputs the results to the console and a JSON file.

## Key Files

### benchmarks/tailwind-component/src/emails
This subdirectory contains the email templates used in the benchmarks.

- `with-tailwind.tsx`: This file defines an email template using Tailwind CSS for styling. It utilizes the `@react-email/components` library to structure the email content and applies Tailwind CSS classes for styling.
- `without-tailwind.tsx`: This file defines the same email template as `with-tailwind.tsx` but without using Tailwind CSS. It relies on inline styles and predefined style objects for styling.

These two files provide a controlled environment for comparing the rendering performance of email templates with and without Tailwind CSS.

### benchmarks/tailwind-component/src/tailwind-render.ts
This file contains a function that renders an email template using the `@react-email/render` library and the `@react-email/tailwind` component. It serves as a helper function for the benchmark scripts, providing a consistent way to render email templates with Tailwind CSS.

## Dependencies

- `@react-email/render`: Used to render React email components into HTML.
- `tinybench`: Provides the benchmarking framework for running performance tests.
- `@react-email/tailwind`: Provides the Tailwind CSS component for React Email.
- `tailwind-0.0.12`: A specific version of the Tailwind CSS component used for benchmarking.
- `tailwind-0.0.15`: Another specific version of the Tailwind CSS component used for benchmarking.
- `node:fs`: Used for writing benchmark results to a file.
