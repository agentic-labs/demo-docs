## High-level description
This code defines a React component for rendering a Google Play Policy Update email template. It uses various components from the "@react-email/components" library to structure the email content, including images, text, links, and layout elements.

## Code Structure
The main component `GooglePlayPolicyUpdateEmail` is defined as a functional component that returns the email structure. It uses several imported components to create the email layout and content. The component is then exported as the default export. Various style objects are defined at the bottom of the file to be used within the component.

## Symbols

### GooglePlayPolicyUpdateEmail
#### Description
This is the main functional component that renders the entire email template.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't take any props.

#### Outputs
Returns a JSX structure representing the email template.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up a `baseUrl` for image sources based on the `VERCEL_URL` environment variable.
2. Renders the email structure using components from "@react-email/components".
3. Applies inline styles and uses predefined style objects for consistent styling.

### Style Objects
Several style objects are defined at the bottom of the file (e.g., `main`, `container`, `heading`, etc.) to be used within the component for consistent styling.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @react-email/components | Provides pre-built components for email templates |

## Configuration
The `baseUrl` is configured based on the `VERCEL_URL` environment variable:
```javascript
const baseUrl = process.env.VERCEL_URL
  ? `https://${process.env.VERCEL_URL}`
  : "";
```

## Performance Considerations
This component uses static content and styling, which should render efficiently. However, the use of multiple nested components and inline styles might affect performance for very large email lists.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code.
