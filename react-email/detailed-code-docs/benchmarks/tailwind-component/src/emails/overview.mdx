## High-level description
This directory contains two implementations of a Google Play Policy Update email template: one using Tailwind CSS (`with-tailwind.tsx`) and one without (`without-tailwind.tsx`). Both implementations use the `@react-email/components` library to structure the email content.

## What does it do?
This directory provides two different approaches to styling an email template. The `with-tailwind.tsx` file demonstrates using Tailwind CSS for styling, while the `without-tailwind.tsx` file relies on inline styles and predefined style objects. Both implementations render the same email content, showcasing the flexibility of the `@react-email/components` library.

## Entry points
The main entry points are the two TypeScript files:

- `with-tailwind.tsx`: This file defines the email template using Tailwind CSS for styling.
- `without-tailwind.tsx`: This file defines the email template using inline styles and predefined style objects.

Developers can choose either implementation based on their preference for styling approaches.
