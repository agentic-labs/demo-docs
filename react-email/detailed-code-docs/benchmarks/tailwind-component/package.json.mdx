- `0.0.15-vs-local` and `0.0.12-vs-local`: Compare specific versions of Tailwind with a local version.
- `flamegraph-render-tailwind`: Generates a flamegraph for Tailwind rendering performance.
- `lint`: Runs ESLint for code quality checks.

### Dependencies

- Uses tinybench for benchmarking.

### DevDependencies
#### Description
Lists development dependencies, including ESLint configuration, TypeScript support, and flamegraph generation tools.

#### Internal Logic
- Uses workspace dependencies for ESLint config and TypeScript configuration.
