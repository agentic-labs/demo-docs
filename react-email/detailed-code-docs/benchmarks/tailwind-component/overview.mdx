## High-level description
This directory contains benchmarks for the `@react-email/tailwind` component, focusing on performance comparisons between different versions and rendering with/without Tailwind CSS. It uses the `tinybench` library for benchmarking and includes email templates for testing.

## What does it do?
The benchmarks in this directory measure the performance of the `@react-email/tailwind` component by:
1. Comparing rendering times of email templates with and without Tailwind CSS.
2. Evaluating performance differences between specific versions (0.0.12, 0.0.15) and a local version of the Tailwind component.
3. Generating flamegraphs for Tailwind rendering performance analysis.

These benchmarks help developers track performance improvements or regressions across versions and understand the overhead of using Tailwind CSS in email templates.

## Entry points
The main entry points are the benchmark scripts in the `src` directory:
- `benchmark-0.0.12-vs-local-version.ts`
- `benchmark-0.0.15-vs-local-version.ts`
- `benchmark-with-vs-without.ts`

Each script sets up benchmarks using `tinybench`, runs them, and outputs results to the console and JSON files.

## Key Files
1. `src/emails/`:
   - `with-tailwind.tsx`: Email template using Tailwind CSS for styling.
   - `without-tailwind.tsx`: Same email template without Tailwind CSS, using inline styles.

2. `src/tailwind-render.ts`: Helper function for rendering email templates with Tailwind CSS.

3. `package.json`: Defines project dependencies and scripts for running benchmarks and linting.

4. `.eslintrc.js`: ESLint configuration for the project.

5. `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript configuration for the project.

## Dependencies
- `@react-email/components`: React Email components
- `@react-email/render`: Rendering utility for React Email
- `@react-email/tailwind`: Tailwind CSS integration for React Email
- `react`: React library (version 19.0.0-rc.0)
- `tailwind-0.0.12` and `tailwind-0.0.15`: Specific versions of Tailwind CSS for benchmarking
- `tinybench`: Benchmarking library

Development dependencies include ESLint, TypeScript, and flamegraph generation tools.

## Configuration
1. `package.json`:
   - Defines scripts for running benchmarks, linting, and generating flamegraphs.
   - Specifies Node.js engine requirement (&gt;=18.0.0).

2. `.eslintrc.js`:
   - Extends a custom React internal configuration.
   - Disables rules for ESLint directive comments and console usage.

3. `tsconfig.json`:
   - Extends a base configuration for React libraries.
   - Sets compiler options for modern JavaScript features and type safety.

The benchmarks are designed to be run using the provided npm scripts, which compile the TypeScript files and execute the benchmarks. Results are output to the console and saved as JSON files for further analysis.

Code snippets:

```json
// package.json (partial)
"scripts": {
  "with-vs-without": "pnpm compile && node ./dist/benchmark-with-vs-without.js",
  "before-perf-vs-after-perf": "pnpm compile && node ./dist/benchmark-0.0.12-vs-local-version",
  "flamegraph-render-tailwind": "pnpm compile && node --prof ./dist/tailwind-render && node --prof-process --preprocess -j isolate*.log | flamebearer",
  "compile": "tsup src/*.ts",
  "lint": "eslint ."
}
```

```javascript
// .eslintrc.js
module.exports = {
  extends: ['custom/react-internal'],
  rules: {
    'eslint-comments/require-description': 'off',
    'no-console': 'off',
  },
};
```

These configurations and scripts provide a comprehensive setup for benchmarking and analyzing the performance of the Tailwind component in React Email templates.
