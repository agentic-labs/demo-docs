## High-level description
The `benchmarks` directory contains performance testing tools and results for two main components of the React Email project: the preview server and the Tailwind CSS integration. These benchmarks are designed to measure and compare the performance of different versions and configurations, helping developers track improvements or regressions over time.

## What does it do?
The benchmarks in this directory serve two primary purposes:

1. Preview Server Performance Testing:
   - Compares startup time and request handling speed between local development and specific canary versions of the React Email preview server.
   - Measures server startup time and performs multiple fetch requests to test response times.
   - Saves benchmark results for analysis and comparison.

2. Tailwind Component Performance Testing:
   - Evaluates rendering performance of email templates with and without Tailwind CSS.
   - Compares specific versions (0.0.12, 0.0.15) against a local version of the Tailwind component.
   - Generates flamegraphs for in-depth performance analysis of Tailwind rendering.

These benchmarks provide valuable insights into the efficiency of the React Email components, allowing developers to make informed decisions about optimizations and release readiness.

## Entry points
The main entry points for the benchmarking processes are located in the respective subdirectories:

1. Preview Server Benchmarks (`benchmarks/preview-server/src/`):
   - `local-vs-2.1.7-canary.2-on-startup.ts`: Focuses on startup performance comparison.
   - `local-vs-2.1.7-canary.2.ts`: Compares overall performance including startup and request handling.

2. Tailwind Component Benchmarks (`benchmarks/tailwind-component/src/`):
   - `benchmark-0.0.12-vs-local-version.ts`
   - `benchmark-0.0.15-vs-local-version.ts`
   - `benchmark-with-vs-without.ts`

These scripts utilize utility functions and email templates to set up and run the benchmarks, outputting results to the console and JSON files.

## Key Files
1. Preview Server Benchmarks:
   - `src/utils/run-server.ts`: Contains the `runServer` function for starting server instances.
   - `src/utils/run-server-and-fetch-preview-page.ts`: Defines the `runServerAndFetchPreviewPage` function for complete server lifecycle testing.
   - `bench-results-30-iterations.json` and `startup-bench-results-30-iterations.json`: Store benchmark results.

2. Tailwind Component Benchmarks:
   - `src/emails/with-tailwind.tsx` and `src/emails/without-tailwind.tsx`: Email templates for testing.
   - `src/tailwind-render.ts`: Helper function for rendering email templates with Tailwind CSS.

## Dependencies
The benchmarks rely on several key dependencies:

1. `react-email` and `react-email-canary`: Local and canary versions of the React Email library.
2. `tinybench` (version 2.5.1): Used for running benchmarks and collecting performance metrics.
3. `tsx` (version 4.7.1) and `typescript` (version 5.1.6): For executing and compiling TypeScript files.
4. `@react-email/components`, `@react-email/render`, and `@react-email/tailwind`: React Email components and utilities.
5. `react` (version 19.0.0-rc.0): React library for component rendering.
6. Various ESLint and development tools for code quality and analysis.

## Configuration
The benchmarking processes use the following configurations:

1. Number of iterations: Both preview server and Tailwind component benchmarks use 30 iterations for balance between accuracy and execution time.

2. Server versions (Preview Server):
   - Local version: Uses a local development build.
   - Canary version: Specifically targets version 2.1.7-canary.2 for comparison.

3. Tailwind versions (Tailwind Component):
   - Compares versions 0.0.12 and 0.0.15 against a local version.

4. Output files: Benchmark results are saved to JSON files for further analysis.

5. Node.js version: Both projects require Node.js version 18.0.0 or higher.

6. Scripts (Tailwind Component):
   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "with-vs-without": "pnpm compile && node ./dist/benchmark-with-vs-without.js",
     "before-perf-vs-after-perf": "pnpm compile && node ./dist/benchmark-0.0.12-vs-local-version",
     "flamegraph-render-tailwind": "pnpm compile && node --prof ./dist/tailwind-render && node --prof-process --preprocess -j isolate*.log | flamebearer",
     "compile": "tsup src/*.ts",
     "lint": "eslint ."
   }
   ```

These benchmarks provide a comprehensive suite for performance testing critical components of the React Email project, enabling developers to track and improve performance across different versions and configurations.
