## High-level description
This script generates a client for an API using the @hey-api/openapi-ts library. It creates TypeScript types based on an OpenAPI specification, moves the generated types file to a specific location, and cleans up temporary files.

## Symbols

### `main`
#### Description
The main function that orchestrates the client generation process. It creates the client, moves the generated types file, and cleans up temporary files.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a client using the `createClient` function from @hey-api/openapi-ts with specific options.
2. Logs a success message.
3. Moves the generated types file from `./client/generated/types.gen.ts` to `./src/types.gen.ts`.
4. Deletes the temporary `./client` directory.

#### Side Effects
- Generates files in the `./client/generated` directory.
- Moves a file from `./client/generated/types.gen.ts` to `./src/types.gen.ts`.
- Deletes the `./client` directory.

## Dependencies
