## High-level description
The `clients/fetch-client/scripts` directory contains scripts for building and managing the fetch-client project. This includes compiling the TypeScript codebase into a distributable JavaScript module and generating a client for an API based on an OpenAPI specification.

## What does it do?
This directory houses the automation logic for the fetch-client project. The `build.js` script transpiles the TypeScript code into a format suitable for Node.js, bundles it into a single file, and prepares it for distribution. The `genClient.js` script leverages an OpenAPI specification to automatically generate a client, complete with TypeScript types, for interacting with an API.

## Key Files
### `build.js`
This script handles the build process of the fetch-client. It uses `esbuild` to compile the TypeScript codebase into a Node.js compatible module. The script is configured to output an ECMAScript module (ESM) with source maps and tree shaking enabled for optimized output.

### `genClient.js`
This script is responsible for generating an API client based on an OpenAPI specification. It utilizes the `@hey-api/openapi-ts` library to generate TypeScript types and a client tailored for use with the `fetch` API. The script also manages the generated files, moving the types to the appropriate location and cleaning up temporary files.
