title: "build.js"
---

## High-level description
This script is responsible for building the fetch-client project using esbuild. It compiles and bundles the TypeScript source code into a Node.js-compatible ECMAScript module (ESM) format, with optimizations like tree shaking and source map generation.

## Symbols

### `build`
#### Description
An asynchronous function that configures and executes the esbuild process to compile and bundle the project.

#### Inputs
This function doesn't take any explicit inputs, but it uses global constants and Node.js built-in modules.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise&lt;BuildResult&gt; | Promise | A promise that resolves to the esbuild BuildResult object |

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls the `esbuild` function with a configuration object.
2. Sets the build target to Node.js version 21.
3. Configures the output as an ECMAScript module (ESM).
4. Enables source map generation and tree shaking.
5. Bundles the code starting from the entry point `src/index.ts`.
6. Outputs the bundled code to the `dist` directory.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| node:path | For working with file and directory paths |
| node:url | Not used in the current code |
| esbuild | For compiling and bundling the TypeScript code |

## Configuration
The build configuration is defined inline within the `build` function. Key settings include:

| Option | Type | Value | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------|:------------|
| platform | string | "node" | Specifies the target platform as Node.js |
| target | string | "node21" | Sets the target Node.js version to 21 |
| format | string | "esm" | Configures the output as an ECMAScript module |
| nodePaths | array | [srcPath] | Adds the source directory to the module resolution paths |
| sourcemap | boolean | true | Enables source map generation |
| treeShaking | boolean | true | Enables dead code elimination |
| bundle | boolean | true | Enables bundling of all dependencies |
| entryPoints | array | [path.join(srcPath, "index.ts")] | Specifies the main entry point of the application |
| outdir | string | buildPath | Sets the output directory for the built files |

## Performance Considerations
The build process includes tree shaking, which helps to reduce the final bundle size by eliminating unused code. This can lead to improved performance in both build time and runtime execution of the resulting application.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code, but potential improvements could include:
1. Adding error handling for the build process.
2. Implementing command-line arguments for configurable build options.
3. Adding support for different build environments (development, production, etc.).
