## High-level description

This directory contains the source code for a TypeScript-based client library designed to interact with the Trieve API. The library provides a type-safe and easy-to-use interface for making API requests, handling authentication, and processing responses. It is built around an auto-generated OpenAPI schema, ensuring accurate type definitions and up-to-date API coverage.

## What does it do?

The Trieve client library simplifies the process of interacting with the Trieve API by providing a structured and type-safe way to make API calls. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

1. API Interaction: The library allows developers to make HTTP requests to various Trieve API endpoints using a single `fetch` method. This method handles the construction of request URLs, headers, and bodies, as well as processing the responses.

2. Authentication: It manages API authentication by incorporating the provided API key into the requests automatically.

3. Type Safety: By utilizing TypeScript and auto-generated type definitions, the library ensures that API requests and responses are correctly structured, reducing the likelihood of runtime errors.

4. Error Handling: The library includes basic error handling, throwing errors for unsuccessful HTTP responses.

5. Configurability: Developers can configure the client with options such as the API key, base URL, and debug mode.

6. Comprehensive API Coverage: The auto-generated types cover a wide range of API functionalities, including search operations, dataset management, and organization-related tasks.

## Key Files

1. `index.ts`:
   This file contains the main `Trieve` class, which serves as the entry point for the client library. It provides the `fetch` method for making API requests and handles the initialization of the client with user-provided configuration.

   Example usage:
   ```typescript
   const client = new Trieve({ apiKey: 'your-api-key', baseUrl: 'https://api.trieve.com' });
   const response = await client.fetch('/search', 'POST', { body: searchPayload });
   ```

2. `types.gen.ts`:
   This file contains auto-generated TypeScript type definitions for the Trieve API. It defines a comprehensive set of types, interfaces, and enums that represent various API request and response structures, as well as data models used throughout the Trieve system.

   Key types include:
   - `APIVersion`: An enum representing the API version.
   - `ChunkMetadata`: Represents metadata for a chunk of data.
   - `SearchChunksReqPayload`: Defines the structure for a search request payload.
   - `Dataset`: Represents a dataset in the Trieve system.
   - `Organization`: Defines the structure of an organization.
   - `$OpenApiTs`: A complex type mapping API paths to their respective HTTP methods and request/response types.

   These types are used extensively in the `Trieve` class to ensure type safety when making API calls.

## Dependencies

The library has minimal external dependencies, primarily relying on TypeScript's type system. The only external dependency mentioned is:

- `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any`: Used to disable TypeScript's any type checking in specific scenarios.

This dependency is likely used for development purposes and doesn't affect the runtime behavior of the library.

## Configuration

The `Trieve` class accepts a configuration object (`TrieveOpts`) with the following options:

| Option  | Type    | Default   | Description                    |
|---------|---------|-----------|--------------------------------|
| apiKey  | string  | undefined | API key for authentication     |
| baseUrl | string  | N/A       | Base URL for the API           |
| debug   | boolean | false     | Enable debug logging           |

Example configuration:

```typescript
const client = new Trieve({
  apiKey: 'your-api-key',
  baseUrl: 'https://api.trieve.com',
  debug: true
});
```

The configuration is used to initialize the client and is applied to all subsequent API requests made through the `fetch` method.

In conclusion, this directory contains a robust and type-safe client library for interacting with the Trieve API. It provides a simple interface for making API calls while leveraging TypeScript's type system to ensure correct usage and reduce runtime errors. The auto-generated types ensure that the library stays up-to-date with the latest API changes, making it a reliable tool for developers integrating Trieve functionality into their applications.
