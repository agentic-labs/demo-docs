## High-level description
The `clients/fetch-client` directory contains the source code and configuration files for a TypeScript-based client library designed to interact with the Trieve API. This client provides a type-safe and easy-to-use interface for making API requests, handling authentication, and processing responses. It is built around an auto-generated OpenAPI schema, ensuring accurate type definitions and up-to-date API coverage.

## What does it do?
The Trieve fetch client simplifies the process of interacting with the Trieve API by providing a structured and type-safe way to make API calls. Its main functionalities include:

1. API Interaction: Allows developers to make HTTP requests to various Trieve API endpoints using a single `fetch` method.
2. Authentication: Manages API authentication by incorporating the provided API key into the requests automatically.
3. Type Safety: Utilizes TypeScript and auto-generated type definitions to ensure correctly structured API requests and responses.
4. Error Handling: Includes basic error handling, throwing errors for unsuccessful HTTP responses.
5. Configurability: Allows developers to configure the client with options such as the API key, base URL, and debug mode.
6. Comprehensive API Coverage: Provides auto-generated types covering a wide range of API functionalities, including search operations, dataset management, and organization-related tasks.

## Key Files
1. `src/index.ts`: Contains the main `Trieve` class, which serves as the entry point for the client library. It provides the `fetch` method for making API requests and handles the initialization of the client with user-provided configuration.

2. `src/types.gen.ts`: Contains auto-generated TypeScript type definitions for the Trieve API, defining a comprehensive set of types, interfaces, and enums that represent various API request and response structures, as well as data models used throughout the Trieve system.

3. `scripts/build.js`: Handles the build process of the fetch-client, using `esbuild` to compile the TypeScript codebase into a Node.js compatible module.

4. `scripts/genClient.js`: Responsible for generating an API client based on an OpenAPI specification, utilizing the `@hey-api/openapi-ts` library to generate TypeScript types and a client tailored for use with the `fetch` API.

5. `openapi.json`: An OpenAPI specification that defines the API for Trieve, including endpoints for authentication, search, analytics, and integrations with external services like Stripe.

## Dependencies
The project has minimal external dependencies, primarily relying on TypeScript's type system. Key development dependencies include:

- typescript: "^5.5.4"
- esbuild: "^0.23.0"
- @hey-api/openapi-ts: "^0.52.1"
- esbuild-register: "^3.6.0"

## Configuration
The project uses several configuration files:

1. `package.json`: Defines the project metadata, scripts, and dependencies.
2. `tsconfig.json`: Specifies TypeScript compiler options, including strict type-checking and output settings.

The `Trieve` class accepts a configuration object (`TrieveOpts`) with the following options:

| Option  | Type    | Default   | Description                    |
|---------|---------|-----------|--------------------------------|
| apiKey  | string  | undefined | API key for authentication     |
| baseUrl | string  | N/A       | Base URL for the API           |
| debug   | boolean | false     | Enable debug logging           |

Example usage:

```typescript
const client = new Trieve({
  apiKey: 'your-api-key',
  baseUrl: 'https://api.trieve.com',
  debug: true
});

const response = await client.fetch('/search', 'POST', { body: searchPayload });
```

This fetch client provides a robust and type-safe way to interact with the Trieve API, making it easier for developers to integrate Trieve functionality into their applications while ensuring correct usage and reducing runtime errors.
