## High-level description
This OpenAPI specification defines the API for Trieve, a service that provides various operations for managing datasets, chunks, groups, topics, messages, and other related entities. It includes endpoints for authentication, search, analytics, and integrations with external services like Stripe.

## Code Structure
The OpenAPI specification is structured into paths, components (schemas, security schemes), and tags. The paths define the various API endpoints, their HTTP methods, request/response formats, and security requirements. The components section defines reusable schemas and security schemes used throughout the API. Tags are used to group related endpoints for better organization.

## References
The specification references numerous schemas defined in the components section, such as `Dataset`, `Chunk`, `ChunkGroup`, `Topic`, `Message`, and various request/response payloads.

## Symbols

### ApiDoc
#### Description
This is the main OpenAPI structure that defines the entire API specification for Trieve.

#### Internal Logic
The `ApiDoc` struct is decorated with the `#[derive(OpenApi)]` attribute, which generates the OpenAPI specification. It includes metadata about the API, server information, security schemes, and references to all the paths and components defined in the API.

### SecurityAddon
#### Description
A modifier that adds security schemes to the OpenAPI specification.

#### Internal Logic
Implements the `Modify` trait to add `ApiKey` and `X-API-KEY` security schemes to the components section of the OpenAPI specification.

## Dependencies
The specification relies on various Rust crates and modules, including:
- `utoipa` for generating the OpenAPI specification
- `actix_web` for web server functionality
- `diesel` for database operations
- `serde` for serialization/deserialization

## Configuration
The API includes various configuration options, such as:
- Database URL
- Redis URL
- QDRANT URL
- SMTP settings
- OpenAI API key
- S3 storage settings
- OIDC (OpenID Connect) settings

## Error Handling
The API defines error responses for various scenarios, typically using the `ErrorResponseBody` schema.

## API/Interface Reference
The API is divided into several main sections, including:
- Authentication
- Dataset management
- Chunk operations
- Group operations
- Topic and Message handling
- File operations
- Analytics
- Stripe integration

Each endpoint is documented with its path, HTTP method, request/response formats, and security requirements.

This OpenAPI specification provides a comprehensive description of the Trieve API, allowing developers to understand and interact with the service programmatically.
