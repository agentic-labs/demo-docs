## High-level description
The `clients/ts-sdk` directory contains the source code and configuration files for the Trieve TypeScript SDK. This SDK provides a comprehensive set of tools for interacting with the Trieve API, enabling developers to integrate Trieve's capabilities into their TypeScript or JavaScript applications.

## What does it do?
The Trieve TypeScript SDK allows developers to:

1. Manage data chunks: search, create, update, and delete chunks, as well as perform operations like autocomplete and recommendations.
2. Organize chunks into groups and perform group-level operations.
3. Retrieve various types of analytics data, including Click-Through Rate (CTR), RAG queries, and search statistics.
4. Handle topics and messages for AI-assisted chat experiences.
5. Manage files: upload, retrieve, delete, and convert files to searchable formats.
6. Track events associated with datasets.
7. Make authenticated HTTP requests to the Trieve API with built-in error handling and response parsing.

## Entry points
The main entry point for the SDK is the `src/index.ts` file, which exports two key components:

1. `TrieveFetchClient`: A low-level client for making HTTP requests to the Trieve API.
2. `TrieveSDK`: The main SDK class that provides a high-level interface for interacting with the Trieve API.

Developers typically interact with the SDK through an instance of the `TrieveSDK` class, which aggregates all the functionality from various modules.

## Key Files
1. `src/sdk.ts`: Defines the `TrieveSDK` class, which serves as the main interface for the SDK.
2. `src/fetch-client.ts`: Implements the `TrieveFetchClient` class for making HTTP requests to the Trieve API.
3. `src/functions/index.ts`: Aggregates all the API methods implemented in subdirectories (chunks, groups, analytics, topics, messages, files, and events).
4. `src/types.gen.ts`: Contains auto-generated TypeScript definitions for API requests, responses, and data structures.
5. `openapi.json`: The OpenAPI specification for the Trieve API, used for generating types and documentation.
6. `package.json`: Defines the project structure, dependencies, and build scripts.
7. `tsconfig.json`: Configures the TypeScript compiler options for the project.
8. `typedoc.json`: Configures the documentation generation using TypeDoc.

## Dependencies
The SDK relies on the following key dependencies:

1. Fetch API: Used for making HTTP requests (built into modern browsers and Node.js).
2. Vitest: Used for unit testing across all modules.
3. esbuild: Fast JavaScript bundler used for building the project.
4. TypeDoc: Documentation generator for TypeScript projects.
5. ESLint: For code linting and maintaining code quality.

## Configuration
The SDK can be configured when initializing the `TrieveSDK` class:

```typescript
const sdk = new TrieveSDK({
  apiKey: 'your-api-key',
  datasetId: 'your-dataset-id',
  baseUrl: 'https://api.trieve.ai',
  debug: false
});
```

Configuration options include:
- `apiKey`: Required for authentication.
- `datasetId`: Specifies the dataset to work with.
- `baseUrl`: The Trieve API endpoint (default: "https://api.trieve.ai").
- `debug`: Enables debug logging when set to true.

The project uses various configuration files:
- `tsconfig.json` for TypeScript compilation settings.
- `.eslintrc.json` for ESLint rules.
- `typedoc.json` for documentation generation settings.

## Code Snippets

Example usage of the SDK:

```typescript
// Initialize the SDK
const sdk = new TrieveSDK({
  apiKey: 'your-api-key',
  datasetId: 'your-dataset-id'
});

// Search for chunks
const searchResults = await sdk.searchChunks({
  query: 'example search',
  page: 1,
  limit: 10
});

// Create a new chunk
const newChunk = await sdk.createChunk({
  content: 'This is a new chunk of content',
  metadata: { key: 'value' }
});

// Retrieve analytics
const analytics = await sdk.getSearchAnalytics({
  startDate: '2023-01-01',
  endDate: '2023-12-31'
});
```

The Trieve TypeScript SDK provides a comprehensive and well-tested set of functions for interacting with various aspects of the Trieve system, enabling developers to build powerful data management, search, and AI-assisted applications with ease.
