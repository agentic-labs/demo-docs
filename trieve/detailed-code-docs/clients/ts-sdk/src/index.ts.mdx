## High-level description
This file serves as the main entry point for the Trieve TypeScript SDK. It exports two key components: `TrieveFetchClient` and `TrieveSDK`, which are essential for interacting with the Trieve API.

## Symbols

### `TrieveFetchClient`
#### Description
This symbol is exported from the "./fetch-client" module. It represents a client for making HTTP requests to the Trieve API using the Fetch API.

### `TrieveSDK`
#### Description
This symbol is exported from the "./sdk" module. It represents the main SDK class that provides a high-level interface for interacting with the Trieve API.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| "./fetch-client" | Provides the `TrieveFetchClient` class for making API requests |
| "./sdk" | Provides the `TrieveSDK` class for high-level API interactions |

## References
The code in this file references and exports symbols from two other files in the project:
1. `fetch-client.ts`: Contains the implementation of `TrieveFetchClient`.
2. `sdk.ts`: Contains the implementation of `TrieveSDK`.

These files are crucial for understanding the full functionality of the SDK.

## Notes
1. The file uses ES6 module syntax for exporting symbols.
2. There's a markdown-supported comment at the top of the file, which suggests that the project's documentation may use Markdown formatting.
3. The file is minimal and serves primarily as an export point for the main components of the SDK, promoting a clean and organized structure for the library.
