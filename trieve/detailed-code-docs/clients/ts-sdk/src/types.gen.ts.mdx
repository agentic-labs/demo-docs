title: "types.gen.ts"
---

This file, `types.gen.ts`, is an auto-generated TypeScript file that defines various types and interfaces used in the Trieve API SDK. Here's a high-level description of its purpose and main functionality:

## High-level description

1. The file defines a comprehensive set of TypeScript types and interfaces that represent the data structures used in the Trieve API.

2. These types cover various aspects of the API, including authentication, chunks, datasets, organizations, search operations, analytics, and more.

3. The file provides type definitions for request payloads, response bodies, and utility types used throughout the SDK.

4. It includes enums for specific options like search methods, recommendation types, and API versions.

5. The types defined here ensure type safety and provide autocompletion support when using the Trieve SDK in TypeScript projects.

## Code Structure

The file is structured as a series of type and interface definitions. There's no specific hierarchy, but related types are generally grouped together. The file exports all these types, making them available for use in other parts of the SDK and in client applications.

## Symbols

Some of the key symbols (types and interfaces) defined in this file include:

1. `APIVersion`: Enum for API versions (V1 or V2).
2. `ChunkMetadata`: Interface representing metadata for a chunk of content.
3. `SearchChunksReqPayload`: Interface for search request payload.
4. `SearchResponseBody`: Interface for search response body.
5. `DatasetDTO`: Interface representing a dataset.
6. `OrganizationDTO`: Interface representing an organization.
7. Various analytics-related types like `CTRAnalytics`, `RAGAnalytics`, etc.

Each of these symbols represents a specific data structure or request/response format used in the Trieve API.

## Dependencies

This file doesn't have external dependencies. It's a pure TypeScript definition file.

The types defined here are used throughout the SDK, particularly in the various function modules like `chunks`, `groups`, `analytics`, etc., to provide type safety and intellisense for API interactions.

In summary, `types.gen.ts` serves as the central type definition file for the Trieve API SDK, providing a comprehensive set of TypeScript types that model the API's data structures and operations.
