Here's a detailed documentation of the target file:

## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for the Topic-related functions of the TrieveSDK. It tests the creation, updating, and retrieval of topics using the SDK.

## Code Structure
The file defines a test suite for Topic-related functions using Vitest. It imports necessary types and constants from other files in the project. The tests are organized within a `describe` block and use a custom `test` function that includes retry and timeout options.

## Symbols

### `describe("Topic Tests", async () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
This is the main test suite for Topic-related functions. It sets up the TrieveSDK instance and contains individual test cases.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets up a `TrieveSDK` instance before running the tests.
- Contains three test cases: `createTopic`, `updateTopic`, and `getAllTopics`.

### `test("createTopic", async () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
Tests the `createTopic` function of the TrieveSDK.

#### Internal Logic
- Calls `trieve.createTopic` with sample data.
- Uses `expectTypeOf` to verify that the returned data matches the `Topic` type.

### `test("updateTopic", async () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
Tests the `updateTopic` function of the TrieveSDK.

#### Internal Logic
- Calls `trieve.updateTopic` with a sample topic ID and new name.
- Uses `expectTypeOf` to verify that the returned data is of type `void`.

### `test("getAllTopics", async () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
Tests the `getAllTopics` function of the TrieveSDK.

#### Internal Logic
- Calls `trieve.getAllTopics` with a sample owner ID.
- Uses `expectTypeOf` to verify that the returned data is an array of `Topic` objects.

## Dependencies
- `vitest`: Used for test assertions and type checking.
- `TrieveSDK`: The main SDK being tested.
- `Topic`: Type definition for the Topic object.
- `EXAMPLE_TOPIC_ID`, `TRIEVE`: Constants imported from the project's test utilities.

## Notes
- The tests use a custom `test` function imported from `"../../__tests__/utils"`, which adds retry and timeout options to each test.
- The tests focus on type checking the returned data rather than asserting specific values.
- The `TrieveSDK` instance is created once before all tests and reused across test cases.

This file serves as a comprehensive test suite for the Topic-related functionality of the TrieveSDK, ensuring that the API calls return data of the expected types.
