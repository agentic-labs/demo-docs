## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for the file-related functions of the TrieveSDK. It tests the uploadFile, getFilesForDataset, and getFile methods using the Vitest testing framework.

## Code Structure
The code imports necessary dependencies and constants, then defines a test suite for file-related functions. Each test case checks the type of the returned data against the expected type.

## Symbols

### `describe("File Tests", async () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
This is the main test suite for file-related functions. It sets up the TrieveSDK instance and contains individual test cases.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up the TrieveSDK instance before all tests.
2. Contains three test cases for uploadFile, getFilesForDataset, and getFile functions.

### `test("uploadFile", async () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
Tests the uploadFile function of the TrieveSDK.

#### Internal Logic
1. Reads a PDF file and encodes it to base64.
2. Calls the uploadFile method with the encoded file and other parameters.
3. Checks if the returned data type matches UploadFileResult.

### `test("getFilesForDataset", async () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
Tests the getFilesForDataset function of the TrieveSDK.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls the getFilesForDataset method with a page parameter.
2. Checks if the returned data type matches File[].

### `test("getFile", async () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
Tests the getFile function of the TrieveSDK.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls the getFile method with a fileId parameter.
2. Checks if the returned data type matches FileDTO.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| vitest | Testing framework used for writing and running the tests |
| fs | Node.js file system module used to read the PDF file |
| TrieveSDK | The main SDK being tested |
| File, FileDTO, UploadFileResult | Types used for type checking in tests |
| EXAMPLE_FILE_ID, TRIEVE | Constants imported from a separate file for use in tests |

## Error Handling
The tests do not explicitly handle errors. Any errors thrown during the execution of the SDK methods will cause the respective test to fail.
