## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of file-related functions for the TrieveSDK, a TypeScript SDK for interacting with the Trieve API. It provides functionality for uploading, retrieving, and managing files within datasets.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory enables developers to perform various file operations using the TrieveSDK:

1. Upload files: Users can upload files to S3 storage attached to the server. The uploaded files are converted to HTML, chunked, and indexed for searching.

2. Retrieve files: Developers can fetch a list of files associated with a specific dataset, with pagination support. They can also download individual files using their unique identifiers.

3. Delete files: The SDK allows for the deletion of files from S3 storage, with an option to remove associated chunks as well.

4. Testing: The directory includes unit tests to ensure the proper functioning of these file-related operations.

These functions abstract the complexities of interacting with the Trieve API, providing a simple interface for developers to manage files within their applications.

## Key Files

1. `index.ts`:
   This file contains the main implementation of the file-related functions. It exports four key functions:

   - `uploadFile`: Uploads a file to S3 and processes it for indexing.
   - `getFilesForDataset`: Retrieves a paginated list of files for a specific dataset.
   - `getFile`: Downloads a specific file by its ID.
   - `deleteFile`: Removes a file from S3 storage.

   Example usage of `uploadFile`:

   ```typescript
   const result = await sdk.uploadFile({
     file: base64EncodedFile,
     name: "example.pdf",
     description: "An example PDF file",
     chunkSize: 1000,
     overlapSize: 100
   });
   ```

2. `file.test.ts`:
   This file contains unit tests for the file-related functions using the Vitest testing framework. It includes tests for:

   - Uploading a file
   - Retrieving files for a dataset
   - Fetching a specific file

   Example test case:

   ```typescript
   test("uploadFile", async () =&gt; {
     const file = fs.readFileSync("./example.pdf", { encoding: "base64" });
     const data = await trieve.uploadFile({
       file,
       name: "example.pdf",
       description: "An example PDF file",
       chunkSize: 1000,
       overlapSize: 100,
     });
     expect(data).toBeTypeOf("object");
   });
   ```

## Dependencies
The code in this directory relies on the following main dependencies:

1. TrieveSDK: The core SDK class that provides the foundation for making API calls.
2. Vitest: A testing framework used for writing and running unit tests.
3. Node.js `fs` module: Used in the test file for reading local files.

## Configuration
The file operations use the dataset ID configured in the TrieveSDK instance. This ID is automatically included in API requests, so developers don't need to specify it for each operation.

The `uploadFile` function accepts configuration options such as `chunkSize` and `overlapSize`, which control how the uploaded file is processed and indexed.

Example configuration when uploading a file:

```typescript
const uploadOptions = {
  file: base64EncodedFile,
  name: "document.pdf",
  description: "Important document",
  chunkSize: 1500,
  overlapSize: 200
};

const result = await sdk.uploadFile(uploadOptions);
```

In this example, the `chunkSize` and `overlapSize` parameters determine how the document is split into searchable chunks during the indexing process.

The file operations in this directory provide a robust and easy-to-use interface for managing files within the Trieve ecosystem, enabling developers to integrate file handling capabilities into their applications with minimal effort.
