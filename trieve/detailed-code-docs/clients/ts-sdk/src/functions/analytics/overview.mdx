## High-level description
This directory contains the analytics functionality for the Trieve SDK, implemented in TypeScript. It provides methods to interact with various analytics endpoints of the Trieve API, including Click-Through Rate (CTR), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), recommendation, search, and cluster analytics. The directory also includes unit tests for these analytics functions.

## What does it do?
The analytics module allows developers to:
1. Retrieve various types of analytics data from the Trieve API, such as CTR metrics, RAG queries, recommendation performance, search statistics, and cluster analytics.
2. Send CTR data to the system for analysis.
3. Perform analytics operations on datasets, providing insights into user interactions, search performance, and content recommendations.

These functionalities enable developers to gain insights into how users interact with their applications, the effectiveness of search and recommendation systems, and the performance of RAG implementations.

## Key Files

### index.ts
This file contains the main implementation of the analytics functions. It exports several methods that are part of the TrieveSDK class:

1. `getCTRAnalytics`: Retrieves Click-Through Rate analytics for a dataset.
2. `sendCTRAnalytics`: Sends CTR data to the system for analysis.
3. `getRagAnalytics`: Fetches Retrieval-Augmented Generation analytics.
4. `getRecommendationAnalytics`: Obtains analytics data for content recommendations.
5. `getSearchAnalytics`: Retrieves search-related analytics.
6. `getClusterAnalytics`: Fetches cluster analytics for a dataset.

Each of these functions makes HTTP requests to specific endpoints of the Trieve API, passing along the necessary data and parameters.

### analytics.test.ts
This file contains unit tests for the analytics functionality implemented in `index.ts`. It uses Vitest as the testing framework and includes tests for each of the main analytics methods. The tests primarily focus on type checking the returned data from each analytics function to ensure they match the expected response types.

## Dependencies
The analytics module relies on the following key dependencies:

1. TrieveSDK: The main SDK class that provides the underlying functionality for making API requests.
2. Vitest: Used for unit testing and type assertions in the test file.
3. Various response types and interfaces from the SDK's type definitions, such as `CTRAnalyticsResponse`, `RAGAnalyticsResponse`, `RecommendationAnalyticsResponse`, and `SearchAnalyticsResponse`.

## Code Examples

Here's an example of how to use the `getCTRAnalytics` function:

```typescript
const trieve = new TrieveSDK({ ... }); // Initialize the SDK

const ctrAnalytics = await trieve.getCTRAnalytics({
  type: "search_ctr_metrics",
  // other parameters as needed
});

// ctrAnalytics will contain the CTR data for the specified dataset
```

And here's how you might send CTR data to the system:

```typescript
await trieve.sendCTRAnalytics({
  chunk_id: "example_chunk_id",
  query: "example search query",
  clicked: true,
  // other relevant data
});
```

These analytics functions provide developers with powerful tools to understand user behavior, optimize search and recommendation systems, and improve the overall performance of their applications built with the Trieve SDK.
