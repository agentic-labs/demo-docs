## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation and tests for the Events functionality in the Trieve SDK. It provides a method to retrieve events for a specific dataset with options for pagination and filtering.

## What does it do?
The Events module allows users of the Trieve SDK to fetch events associated with a particular dataset. Events could represent various activities or occurrences within the dataset, such as data updates, user interactions, or system notifications. The module provides a flexible way to query these events, potentially allowing for filtering and pagination to manage large volumes of event data efficiently.

## Key Files

1. `index.ts`:
   - This file defines the main functionality of the Events module.
   - It exports a single function `getEventsForDataset` which is the primary method for retrieving events.
   - The function takes query parameters and an optional abort signal, allowing for flexible and cancellable event retrieval.

2. `events.test.ts`:
   - This file contains unit tests for the Events functionality.
   - It verifies that the `getEventsForDataset` method returns data of the expected type.
   - The test uses a pre-configured TrieveSDK instance and focuses on type-checking rather than specific data validation.

## Dependencies
The Events module relies on the core TrieveSDK functionality and doesn't introduce any additional external dependencies. It uses the SDK's built-in `fetch` method for making API requests.

For testing, the module uses:
- `vitest`: A testing framework providing utilities like `beforeAll`, `describe`, and `expectTypeOf`.
- Custom test utilities: A modified `test` function with retry and timeout options.

## Configuration
The Events module doesn't require specific configuration. It uses the dataset ID configured in the TrieveSDK instance when making API requests.

## Code Examples

Here's an example of how to use the `getEventsForDataset` function:

```typescript
const trieveSDK = new TrieveSDK(/* configuration */);

const eventsData = await trieveSDK.getEventsForDataset({
  // Query parameters
  page: 1,
  limit: 50,
  // Add other filter options as needed
});

// Process the returned events data
console.log(eventsData);
```

And here's a snippet from the test file showing how the function is tested:

```typescript
test("getEventsForDataset", async () =&gt; {
  const result = await TRIEVE.getEventsForDataset({});
  expectTypeOf(result).toMatchTypeOf&lt;EventReturn&gt;();
});
```

This test ensures that the `getEventsForDataset` function returns data that matches the `EventReturn` type, which is likely defined elsewhere in the SDK.

The Events module provides a straightforward way to interact with the events API of the Trieve platform, allowing developers to easily retrieve and potentially analyze event data associated with their datasets.
