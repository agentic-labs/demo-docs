Here's a detailed documentation of the target file:

## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for the Events functionality of the TrieveSDK. It tests the `getEventsForDataset` method to ensure it returns the expected type of data.

## Code Structure
The file imports necessary dependencies and sets up a test suite for Events. It initializes a TrieveSDK instance before running the tests.

## Symbols

### `describe("Events Tests", async () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
This is the main test suite for Events functionality. It sets up the TrieveSDK instance and contains individual test cases.

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes a `TrieveSDK` instance before running the tests.
2. Contains a test case for the `getEventsForDataset` method.

### `test("getEventsForDataset", async () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
This test case verifies the functionality of the `getEventsForDataset` method of the TrieveSDK.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls the `getEventsForDataset` method with an empty object as parameters.
2. Uses `expectTypeOf` to check if the returned data matches the `EventReturn` type.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| vitest | Provides testing utilities like `beforeAll`, `describe`, and `expectTypeOf`. |
| TrieveSDK | The main SDK class being tested. |
| EventReturn | Type definition for the expected return value of `getEventsForDataset`. |
| TRIEVE | A pre-configured TrieveSDK instance for testing. |
| test | A custom test function that adds retry and timeout options. |

## Notes
1. The test uses a custom `test` function imported from `"../../__tests__/utils"`, which adds retry and timeout options to the base Vitest test function.
2. The `TRIEVE` constant is imported from `"../../__tests__/constants"`, which is a pre-configured TrieveSDK instance used for testing.
3. The test case doesn't assert any specific values but only checks the type of the returned data.
4. The `getEventsForDataset` method is called with an empty object, suggesting that it can work without any parameters or that the test is not checking specific parameter handling.

This test file ensures that the `getEventsForDataset` method of the TrieveSDK returns data of the expected type (`EventReturn`). It's a type-level test that doesn't verify the actual content of the returned data.
