## High-level description
This directory contains TypeScript functions and tests for interacting with the groups API of the Trieve SDK. It provides a comprehensive set of methods for managing chunk groups, including creation, searching, updating, and deletion, as well as operations for managing chunks within groups.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory enables developers to perform various operations related to chunk groups in the Trieve SDK. Here's a simplified explanation of its functionality:

1. Create new chunk groups in a dataset
2. Search for groups or within specific groups
3. Update existing chunk groups
4. Add or remove chunks from groups
5. Retrieve groups associated with specific chunks
6. Get recommended groups based on existing group IDs
7. Manage groups using tracking IDs
8. Delete groups and optionally their associated chunks
9. Retrieve chunks within a group
10. Get groups for a specific dataset

These operations allow developers to organize and manage data chunks efficiently within the Trieve system, enabling features like grouping related content, searching across or within groups, and maintaining relationships between chunks and groups.

## Key Files

### index.ts
This file contains the main implementation of the group-related functions. It exports multiple async functions, each corresponding to a specific operation on chunk groups. These functions are methods of the TrieveSDK class and utilize its `trieve.fetch` method to make API calls.

Key functions include:
- `createChunkGroup`: Creates new chunk group(s) in the specified dataset
- `searchOverGroups`: Performs a search over groups, returning groups as results
- `searchInGroup`: Performs a search within a specific group
- `updateGroup`: Updates an existing chunk group
- `addChunkToGroup`: Adds a chunk to a specified group
- `getGroupsForChunks`: Retrieves the groups that specified chunks belong to
- `deleteGroup`: Deletes a group and optionally its chunks

### chunkGroup.test.ts
This file contains unit tests for the chunk group methods of the TrieveSDK. It uses Vitest as the testing framework and covers various functionalities related to creating, searching, updating, and retrieving chunk groups and their associated data.

Key test cases include:
- Creating a chunk group
- Searching over groups
- Searching within a group
- Getting recommended groups
- Updating a group
- Retrieving groups for chunks
- Getting a group by tracking ID
- Getting chunks in a group
- Retrieving groups for a dataset

## Dependencies
The code in this directory relies on the following main dependencies:

1. TrieveSDK: The main SDK being used and tested.
2. Vitest: Used as the testing framework for writing and running unit tests.
3. Various type definitions: Imported from "../../types.gen" and "../../fetch-client" to ensure type safety and consistency across the SDK.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files in this directory, the functions often use optional `AbortSignal` parameters, allowing for request cancellation. Additionally, many functions accept data objects as parameters, which can be configured to adjust the behavior of the API calls.

The test file uses a custom `test` function imported from `../../__tests__/utils` which sets a retry count of 3 and a timeout of 30 seconds for each test. This configuration helps handle potential network issues or slow responses during testing.

In summary, this directory provides a robust set of functions for managing chunk groups in the Trieve SDK, along with comprehensive unit tests to ensure their functionality. The code is designed to be flexible and type-safe, allowing developers to easily integrate group management features into their applications using the Trieve platform.
