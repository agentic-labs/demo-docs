## High-level description
This code defines the `TrieveSDK` class, which serves as the main entry point for interacting with the Trieve API. It initializes the SDK with configuration options and dynamically adds methods from the `methods` object to the class prototype.

## Code Structure
The `TrieveSDK` class is defined with a constructor that initializes a `TrieveFetchClient` instance. The `methods` object is then used to dynamically add API methods to the `TrieveSDK` prototype. The code also includes a type declaration to extend the `TrieveSDK` interface with the methods from the `methods` object.

### TrieveSDK
#### Description
The main class for interacting with the Trieve API. It initializes the SDK with configuration options and provides access to various API methods.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| apiKey | string | The API key for authentication |
| baseUrl | string | The base URL for the API (default: "https://api.trieve.ai") |
| debug | boolean | Enable debug mode (default: false) |
| datasetId | string | The ID of the dataset to use |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a new `TrieveFetchClient` instance with the provided configuration.
2. Stores the `datasetId` for use in API calls.
3. Dynamically adds methods from the `methods` object to the `TrieveSDK` prototype.

### Methods
#### Description
An object containing various API methods that are dynamically added to the `TrieveSDK` prototype.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| "./functions/index" | Imports the `methods` object containing API functions |
| "./fetch-client" | Imports the `TrieveFetchClient` class for making API requests |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| apiKey | string | - | The API key for authentication |
| baseUrl | string | "https://api.trieve.ai" | The base URL for the API |
| debug | boolean | false | Enable debug mode |
| datasetId | string | - | The ID of the dataset to use |

## TODOs
- The `@ts-expect-error` comment suggests that there might be a type-related issue that needs to be addressed in the future.
