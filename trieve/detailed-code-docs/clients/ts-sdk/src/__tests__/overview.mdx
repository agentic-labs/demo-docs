## High-level description
This directory contains test files and utilities for the TrieveSDK TypeScript implementation. It includes constants used across various test files and a custom test function wrapper to standardize test configurations.

## What does it do?
The `__tests__` directory serves as a central location for testing the TrieveSDK functionality. It provides:

1. A set of constants (`constants.ts`) that define example IDs, sample data, and a pre-configured TrieveSDK instance. These constants are used across multiple test files to ensure consistency in test data and reduce duplication.

2. A utility function (`utils.ts`) that wraps Vitest's test function, applying standard retry and timeout settings to all tests. This ensures that tests are given multiple attempts to pass and have a consistent timeout duration.

These components work together to facilitate thorough and consistent testing of the TrieveSDK's various features and functions.

## Key Files

1. `constants.ts`:
   - Defines a set of constant values used across multiple test files.
   - Includes example IDs for groups, chunks, topics, messages, and files.
   - Provides a pre-configured TrieveSDK instance for use in tests.
   - Contains sample HTML content for testing chunk-related functionality.

2. `utils.ts`:
   - Defines a custom `test` function that wraps Vitest's base test function.
   - Applies standard retry (3 attempts) and timeout (30 seconds) settings to all tests.
   - Used across various test files to ensure consistent test behavior.

## Dependencies
The test files in this directory primarily depend on:

1. Vitest (version not specified): Used as the testing framework.
2. TrieveSDK: The main subject of testing, imported from "../sdk".

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files in this directory, the `utils.ts` file effectively acts as a configuration for test behavior:

- `retry: 3`: Each test will be attempted up to 3 times before being marked as failed.
- `timeout: 30_000`: Each test has a maximum duration of 30 seconds (30,000 milliseconds).

These settings are applied globally to all tests that use the custom `test` function defined in `utils.ts`.

## Code Snippets

Here's an example of how the constants are defined in `constants.ts`:

```typescript
export const GROUP_EXAMPLE_ID = "example_group_id";
export const GROUP_EXAMPLE_TRACKING_ID = "example_group_tracking_id";
export const TRIEVE = new TrieveSDK({
  serverUrl: "http://localhost:8090",
  apiKey: "example_api_key",
});
```

And here's the custom test function defined in `utils.ts`:

```typescript
import { test as baseTest } from "vitest";

export const test = (name: string, fn: () =&gt; void) =&gt;
  baseTest(name, { retry: 3, timeout: 30_000 }, fn);
```

These components are used across various test files in the project. For example, a typical test file might look like this:

```typescript
import { test } from "../__tests__/utils";
import { TRIEVE, GROUP_EXAMPLE_ID } from "../__tests__/constants";

test("should perform some operation", async () =&gt; {
  const result = await TRIEVE.someOperation(GROUP_EXAMPLE_ID);
  // assertions here
});
```

This structure allows for consistent and efficient testing across the entire TrieveSDK implementation.
