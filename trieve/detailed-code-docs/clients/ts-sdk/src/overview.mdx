## High-level description
The `clients/ts-sdk/src` directory contains the core implementation of the Trieve TypeScript SDK. It provides a comprehensive set of tools for interacting with the Trieve API, including data management, search functionality, analytics, and AI-assisted operations. The SDK is designed to be flexible, type-safe, and easy to use for developers integrating Trieve's capabilities into their TypeScript or JavaScript applications.

## What does it do?
The Trieve TypeScript SDK enables developers to:

1. Manage chunks of data: search, create, update, and delete chunks, as well as perform operations like autocomplete and recommendations.
2. Organize chunks into groups and perform group-level operations.
3. Retrieve various types of analytics data, including Click-Through Rate (CTR), RAG queries, and search statistics.
4. Handle topics and messages for AI-assisted chat experiences.
5. Manage files: upload, retrieve, delete, and convert files to searchable formats.
6. Track events associated with datasets.
7. Make authenticated HTTP requests to the Trieve API with built-in error handling and response parsing.

## Entry points
The main entry point for the SDK is the `index.ts` file, which exports two key components:

1. `TrieveFetchClient`: A low-level client for making HTTP requests to the Trieve API.
2. `TrieveSDK`: The main SDK class that provides a high-level interface for interacting with the Trieve API.

Developers typically interact with the SDK through an instance of the `TrieveSDK` class, which aggregates all the functionality from various modules.

## Key Files
1. `sdk.ts`: Defines the `TrieveSDK` class, which serves as the main interface for the SDK.
2. `fetch-client.ts`: Implements the `TrieveFetchClient` class for making HTTP requests to the Trieve API.
3. `functions/index.ts`: Aggregates all the API methods implemented in subdirectories (chunks, groups, analytics, topics, messages, files, and events).
4. `types.gen.ts`: Contains auto-generated TypeScript definitions for API requests, responses, and data structures.

## Dependencies
The SDK relies on the following key dependencies:

1. Fetch API: Used for making HTTP requests (built into modern browsers and Node.js).
2. Vitest: Used for unit testing across all modules.

## Configuration
The SDK can be configured when initializing the `TrieveSDK` class:

```typescript
const sdk = new TrieveSDK({
  apiKey: 'your-api-key',
  datasetId: 'your-dataset-id',
  baseUrl: 'https://api.trieve.ai',
  debug: false
});
```

Configuration options include:
- `apiKey`: Required for authentication.
- `datasetId`: Specifies the dataset to work with.
- `baseUrl`: The Trieve API endpoint (default: "https://api.trieve.ai").
- `debug`: Enables debug logging when set to true.

Many SDK methods accept an optional `AbortSignal` parameter for request cancellation.

## Code Snippets

Example usage of the SDK:

```typescript
// Initialize the SDK
const sdk = new TrieveSDK({
  apiKey: 'your-api-key',
  datasetId: 'your-dataset-id'
});

// Search for chunks
const searchResults = await sdk.searchChunks({
  query: 'example search',
  page: 1,
  limit: 10
});

// Create a new chunk
const newChunk = await sdk.createChunk({
  content: 'This is a new chunk of content',
  metadata: { key: 'value' }
});

// Retrieve analytics
const analytics = await sdk.getSearchAnalytics({
  startDate: '2023-01-01',
  endDate: '2023-12-31'
});
```

The SDK provides a comprehensive and well-tested set of functions for interacting with various aspects of the Trieve system, enabling developers to build powerful data management, search, and AI-assisted applications with ease.
