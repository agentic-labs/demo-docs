## High-level description
This script generates a TypeScript client for an API using the @hey-api/openapi-ts library. It creates the client based on an OpenAPI specification, moves the generated types file to a specific location, and cleans up temporary files.

## Symbols

### `main`
#### Description
An asynchronous function that orchestrates the client generation process, file movement, and cleanup.

#### Internal Logic
1. Generates the client using `createClient` from @hey-api/openapi-ts.
2. Moves the generated types file to a new location.
3. Deletes the temporary generated folder.

### `createClient`
#### Description
A function imported from @hey-api/openapi-ts that generates the API client.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| options | object | Configuration options for client generation |

#### Internal Logic
Generates the client based on the provided options:
- Uses the 'fetch' client
- Generates types
- Doesn't generate schemas or services
- Uses './openapi.json' as input
- Outputs to './client/generated'

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @hey-api/openapi-ts | Provides the `createClient` function for generating the API client |
| node:fs | Used for file system operations (renaming and deleting files/directories) |

## Side Effects
- Creates files and directories in the local file system
- Moves and deletes files and directories

## TODOs
The code includes a console log message: "Client generated successfully!". This could potentially be expanded to include more detailed logging or error handling in the future.
