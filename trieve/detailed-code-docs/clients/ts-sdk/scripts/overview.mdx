## High-level description
This directory contains scripts for building and generating a TypeScript SDK. It includes two main scripts: one for building the SDK using esbuild, and another for generating a TypeScript client based on an OpenAPI specification.

## What does it do?
The scripts in this directory perform two primary functions:

1. Building the SDK: The build script compiles the TypeScript source code into a bundled JavaScript output optimized for Node.js environments. It uses esbuild to perform this compilation, applying various optimizations like tree shaking and bundling.

2. Generating API Client: The client generation script creates a TypeScript client for an API using the @hey-api/openapi-ts library. It generates the client based on an OpenAPI specification, moves the generated types file to a specific location, and cleans up temporary files.

These scripts automate the process of preparing the SDK for distribution and use, ensuring that the latest API specifications are incorporated and that the output is optimized for Node.js environments.

## Key Files

### build.js
This script is responsible for building the TypeScript SDK using esbuild. Its main features include:

- Configuring esbuild with specific options tailored for Node.js environments
- Compiling TypeScript source code into bundled JavaScript
- Enabling optimizations like tree shaking and source map generation

The `build` function in this file is the core of the build process:

```javascript
async function build() {
  return esbuild.build({
    platform: "node",
    target: "node21",
    format: "esm",
    nodePaths: [srcPath],
    sourcemap: true,
    treeShaking: true,
    bundle: true,
    entryPoints: [path.join(srcPath, "index.ts")],
    outdir: buildPath,
  });
}
```

This function configures esbuild to target Node.js version 21, use ES modules format, enable source maps and tree shaking, and bundle all dependencies.

### genClient.js
This script generates a TypeScript client for an API using the @hey-api/openapi-ts library. Its main features include:

- Generating the client based on an OpenAPI specification
- Moving the generated types file to a specific location
- Cleaning up temporary files after generation

The `main` function orchestrates the client generation process:

```javascript
async function main() {
  await createClient({
    client: "fetch",
    generateTypes: true,
    generateSchemas: false,
    generateServices: false,
    input: "./openapi.json",
    output: "./client/generated",
  });

  await fs.promises.rename(
    "./client/generated/types.ts",
    "./src/types/generated.ts"
  );

  await fs.promises.rm("./client", { recursive: true });

  console.log("Client generated successfully!");
}
```

This function generates the client, moves the types file, and cleans up temporary directories.

## Dependencies
The scripts in this directory rely on the following external libraries:

1. esbuild (version not specified)
   - Purpose: Used for compiling and bundling the TypeScript code
   - Chosen for its speed and efficiency in building JavaScript and TypeScript projects

2. @hey-api/openapi-ts (version not specified)
   - Purpose: Provides the `createClient` function for generating the API client
   - Chosen for its ability to generate TypeScript clients from OpenAPI specifications

## Configuration
The build configuration is hardcoded within the `build` function in `build.js`. Key settings include:

| Option | Value | Description |
|:-------|:------|:------------|
| platform | "node" | Specifies the target platform as Node.js |
| target | "node21" | Sets the target Node.js version to 21 |
| format | "esm" | Configures the output format as ES modules |
| sourcemap | true | Enables generation of source maps |
| treeShaking | true | Enables dead code elimination |
| bundle | true | Enables bundling of all dependencies |

The client generation configuration is set within the `main` function in `genClient.js`:

| Option | Value | Description |
|:-------|:------|:------------|
| client | "fetch" | Specifies the use of the 'fetch' client |
| generateTypes | true | Enables generation of TypeScript types |
| generateSchemas | false | Disables generation of schemas |
| generateServices | false | Disables generation of services |
| input | "./openapi.json" | Specifies the input OpenAPI specification file |
| output | "./client/generated" | Sets the output directory for generated files |

These scripts provide a streamlined process for building and updating the TypeScript SDK, ensuring that it remains up-to-date with the latest API specifications and is optimized for use in Node.js environments.
