## High-level description
This CSS file defines the styling for a TypeScript SDK documentation theme. It sets up color schemes for light and dark modes, defines fonts, and styles various elements such as headings, links, tables, and navigation components. The theme is designed to be responsive and accessible, with a focus on readability and consistency.

## Code Structure
The CSS is organized into sections, each focusing on specific elements or components of the documentation. It uses CSS custom properties (variables) extensively for easy theming and maintenance.

## Symbols

### `:root`
#### Description
Defines CSS custom properties for colors, fonts, and other theme-related values.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets up color variables for light and dark themes
- Defines font families for text and code
- Uses media queries and data attributes to switch between light and dark themes

#### Description
Sets the default font family for the entire document.

### Headings (`h1`, `h2`, `h3`, `h4`, `h5`, `h6`)
#### Description
Defines margin styles for headings.

### Links (`a`, `.tsd-kind-class`, `.tsd-index-link`)
#### Description
Styles links and related classes, including hover effects.

### Lists (`ul`, `ol`, `li`)
#### Description
Sets up styles for unordered and ordered lists, including list item markers.

### Input fields (`input`)

Styles buttons with consistent colors, border radius, and hover effects.

### Checkboxes

Customizes the appearance of checkboxes, including checked state.

### Select elements (`select`)

### Code blocks (`code`, `pre`)
#### Description
Defines styles for inline code and code blocks, including font family and colors.

### Warnings (`.warning`)
#### Description

### Top bar (`.tsd-page-toolbar`)
#### Description
Styles the top navigation bar, including search functionality.

### Side navigation (`.site-menu`, `.tsd-navigation`)
#### Description
Defines styles for the side navigation menu, including hover and active states.

### Type definition groups
#### Description
Styles various components related to type definitions and member groups.

### Footer
#### Description

## Dependencies
This CSS file does not have explicit external dependencies, but it is designed to work with a specific HTML structure, likely generated by a documentation tool like TypeDoc.

## Configuration
The theme can be configured using CSS custom properties defined in the `:root` selector. These properties control colors, fonts, and other visual aspects of the theme.

## Performance Considerations
The use of CSS custom properties allows for efficient theme switching without requiring a full page reload. However, extensive use of these properties might have a slight performance impact on older browsers.
