## High-level description
This repository contains the source code and configuration files for Trieve, a comprehensive platform for building hybrid vector search, recommendations, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. The project is structured as a monorepo, encompassing multiple frontend applications, a backend server, and various supporting services and tools.

## What does it do?
Trieve provides a suite of tools and services for:

1. Semantic dense vector search using OpenAI or Jina embedding models and Qdrant vector database.
2. Typo-tolerant full-text/neural search using SPLADE (Sparse Lexical and Expansion) models.
3. Sub-sentence highlighting for improved search result presentation.
4. Recommendations based on similarity search.
5. Convenient RAG API routes with integration to various language models.
6. Hybrid search with cross-encoder re-ranking for optimal results.
7. Recency biasing and popularity-based ranking for search results.
8. Filtering capabilities including date-range, substring match, tag, and numeric filters.
9. Duplicate detection and grouping of related content.
10. User and organization management with authentication and authorization.
11. Analytics and metrics collection for search and RAG performance.

## Entry points
The main entry points for the Trieve platform are:

1. Backend Server: `server/src/main.rs`
2. Frontend Applications:
   - Analytics: `frontends/analytics/src/index.tsx`
   - Chat: `frontends/chat/src/index.tsx`
   - Dashboard: `frontends/dashboard/src/index.tsx`
   - Search: `frontends/search/src/index.tsx`
3. TypeScript SDK: `clients/ts-sdk/src/index.ts`

## Key Files
1. `server/src/lib.rs`: Main backend server configuration and setup.
2. `frontends/*/src/components/`: Key components for each frontend application.
3. `docker-compose.yml`: Defines the multi-container Docker environment.
4. `helm/Chart.yaml`: Helm chart for Kubernetes deployment.
5. `terraform/`: Infrastructure-as-Code configurations for cloud deployments.
6. `scripts/`: Utility scripts for setup and configuration.
7. `clients/ts-sdk/src/sdk.ts`: Main TypeScript SDK implementation.

## Dependencies
Trieve relies on several key technologies and services:

1. Rust (backend server)
2. SolidJS (frontend applications)
3. Docker and Kubernetes (containerization and orchestration)
4. PostgreSQL, Redis, Qdrant, and ClickHouse (databases)
5. OpenAI and Jina AI (embedding models)
6. Keycloak (authentication)
7. Stripe (payment processing)
8. AWS, GCP (cloud infrastructure)

## Configuration
The project uses various configuration methods:

1. Environment variables: Loaded from `.env` files for local development.
2. Helm values: For Kubernetes deployments (`helm/values.yaml`).
3. Terraform variables: For cloud infrastructure setup.
4. Docker Compose configurations: For local development and embedding servers.

Key configuration areas include database connections, API keys, feature flags, and deployment-specific settings.

Trieve offers flexible deployment options, including self-hosting with Docker Compose, local Kubernetes clusters, and cloud deployments on AWS EKS or GCP GKE. The project provides comprehensive documentation and scripts to facilitate these various deployment scenarios.

In summary, Trieve is a powerful and flexible platform for building advanced search and recommendation systems, with a modular architecture that allows for easy customization and scaling across different deployment environments.
