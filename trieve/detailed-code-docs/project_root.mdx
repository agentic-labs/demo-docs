## High-level description
This repository contains the source code and configuration files for Trieve, a comprehensive AI-powered search and analytics platform. The project is structured as a monorepo, encompassing multiple frontend applications, a backend server, client libraries, and deployment configurations for various environments.

## What does it do?
Trieve provides a suite of tools and services for advanced search, analytics, and data management:

1. Search Interface: Offers semantic and full-text search capabilities with sub-sentence highlighting.
2. Chat Application: Implements an AI-powered chat interface for interacting with datasets.
3. Analytics Dashboard: Visualizes search performance and usage statistics.
4. Data Management: Allows for ingestion, processing, and organization of various data types.
5. API Server: Provides a robust backend for handling search queries, data management, and integrations.
6. Embedding Services: Utilizes machine learning models for text embedding and reranking.
7. Authentication: Implements secure user authentication and authorization.
8. Self-hosting Options: Supports deployment on various platforms including Docker Compose, Kubernetes (local and cloud), and cloud providers like AWS and GCP.

## Entry points
The main entry points for developers and users interacting with the Trieve platform include:

1. Frontend Applications:
   - Search UI: `frontends/search/src/index.tsx`
   - Chat UI: `frontends/chat/src/index.tsx`
   - Dashboard UI: `frontends/dashboard/src/index.tsx`
   - Analytics UI: `frontends/analytics/src/index.tsx`

2. Backend Server: `server/src/main.rs`

3. Client Library: `clients/fetch-client/src/index.ts`

4. Deployment Scripts:
   - Docker Compose: `docker-compose.yml`
   - Kubernetes Helm Chart: `helm/Chart.yaml`

5. Self-hosting Guide: `self-hosting.md`

## Key Files
1. `docker-compose.yml`: Defines the multi-container Docker application for local development and self-hosting.
2. `helm/Chart.yaml`: The main Helm chart for Kubernetes deployments.
3. `server/src/lib.rs`: Core implementation of the Trieve server application.
4. `frontends/*/src/index.tsx`: Entry points for various frontend applications.
5. `clients/fetch-client/src/index.ts`: Main file for the Trieve API client library.
6. `terraform/aws/main.tf` and `terraform/gcloud/main.tf`: Infrastructure-as-code for AWS and Google Cloud deployments.
7. `scripts/setup-self-hosting.sh` and `scripts/configure-self-hosting.sh`: Scripts for setting up self-hosted instances.

## Dependencies
Trieve relies on several key technologies and services:

1. Frontend: Solid.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
2. Backend: Rust, Actix Web, Diesel ORM
3. Databases: PostgreSQL, Redis, Qdrant (vector database), ClickHouse (analytics)
4. Machine Learning: Hugging Face Transformers for text embeddings
5. Authentication: Keycloak
6. Cloud Services: AWS, Google Cloud Platform
7. Containerization: Docker, Kubernetes
8. Infrastructure-as-Code: Terraform
9. Build Tools: Turborepo, Vite

## Configuration
The project uses various configuration methods:

1. Environment Variables: Defined in `.env` files and used across different components.
2. Helm Values: `helm/values.yaml` for Kubernetes deployments.
3. Terraform Variables: Defined in `terraform/*/variables.tf` for cloud deployments.
4. Docker Compose: Environment and service configurations in `docker-compose.yml`.
5. TypeScript Configurations: `tsconfig.json` files in frontend and client directories.
6. Rust Configurations: `Cargo.toml` files for backend and worker services.

Key configurable aspects include API endpoints, database connection strings, authentication settings, and cloud resource allocations.

In conclusion, Trieve is a comprehensive platform that combines advanced search capabilities, data analytics, and AI-powered interactions. Its modular architecture and flexible deployment options make it suitable for a wide range of use cases, from local development to large-scale cloud deployments.
