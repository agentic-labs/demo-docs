## High-level description
This cloud-config file is used to configure an EC2 instance in AWS. It sets up DNS servers, creates user groups, configures the default user, and creates a new user named "dev" with specific permissions and SSH access.

## Symbols

### Cloud-Config
#### Description
This YAML file is a cloud-config file, which is used to initialize and configure cloud instances, specifically for EC2 instances in AWS.

#### Internal Logic
1. Configures DNS settings
2. Sets up user groups
3. Configures the default user
4. Creates a new user named "dev" with specific permissions and SSH access

### manage-resolv-conf
#### Description
This setting enables management of the resolv.conf file, which is used for DNS resolution.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| manage-resolv-conf | boolean | Enables management of resolv.conf |

### resolv_conf
#### Description
Configures the DNS nameservers for the instance.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| nameservers | list of strings | List of DNS server IP addresses |

### groups
#### Description
Defines user groups for the instance.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ec2-user | list | Members of the ec2-user group |
| dev | list | Members of the dev group |
| docker | list | Empty list for the docker group |

### system_info
#### Description
Configures the default user's group membership.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| default_user.groups | list | Groups the default user belongs to |

### users
#### Description
Configures users on the instance, including the default user and a new "dev" user.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| default | string | Includes the default user |
| name | string | Name of the new user |
| homedir | string | Home directory for the new user |
| shell | string | Shell for the new user |
| primary_group | string | Primary group for the new user |
| sudo | string | Sudo permissions for the new user |
| groups | list | Additional groups for the new user |
| lock_passwd | boolean | Whether to lock the user's password |
| ssh-authorized-keys | list | SSH public keys for user authentication |

## Dependencies
This cloud-config file relies on the cloud-init system, which is typically pre-installed on cloud provider images.

## Configuration
The main configuration options in this file are:

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| manage-resolv-conf | boolean | true | Enables management of resolv.conf |
| nameservers | list | ["8.8.8.8", "8.8.4.4"] | DNS server IP addresses |
| ssh_key | string | ${ssh_key} | SSH public key for the dev user |

Note: The `${ssh_key}` syntax suggests that this value is meant to be populated by a variable, likely from a Terraform configuration.

## Side Effects
- Modifies the `/etc/resolv.conf` file to set DNS servers
- Creates new user groups: ec2-user, dev, and docker
- Modifies the default user's group membership
- Creates a new user named "dev" with sudo permissions and SSH access

This cloud-config will significantly alter the instance's user and group configuration, as well as its network settings. These changes will take effect when the instance is launched or when cloud-init is run.
