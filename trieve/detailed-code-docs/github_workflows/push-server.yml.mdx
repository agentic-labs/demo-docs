## High-level description
This GitHub Actions workflow, named "Create Docker Images," is designed to build and push Docker images for various components of a server application. It is triggered on pushes to the main branch or manually, and it creates images for different services such as the main server, ingest worker, delete worker, file worker, group worker, and various utility scripts.

## Code Structure
The workflow is composed of multiple jobs, each responsible for building and pushing a specific Docker image. All jobs follow a similar structure, with slight variations in the Docker file used and the image name.

## Symbols

### `build_server`
#### Description
This job builds and pushes the main server Docker image.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks out the repository
2. Sets up Docker Buildx
3. Logs in to Docker Hub
4. Configures Docker metadata
5. Builds and pushes the Docker image using the specified Dockerfile

### `ingest_worker`
#### Description
This job builds and pushes the ingest worker Docker image.

### `delete_worker`
#### Description
This job builds and pushes the delete worker Docker image.

### `file_worker`
#### Description
This job builds and pushes the file worker Docker image.

### `group_worker`
#### Description
This job builds and pushes the group worker Docker image.

### `clone_qdrant`
#### Description
This job builds and pushes a Docker image for the Qdrant cloning script.

### `sync_qdrant`
#### Description
This job builds and pushes a Docker image for the Qdrant synchronization script.

### `queue_bm25`
#### Description
This job builds and pushes a Docker image for the BM25 queue migration script.

### `reindex-worker`
#### Description
This job builds and pushes a Docker image for the reindex worker.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|

## Performance Considerations
The workflow uses matrix strategies to build images for specific platforms (linux/amd64) and runners. It also utilizes Docker layer caching to improve build times.
