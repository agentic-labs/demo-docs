## High-level description
This GitHub Actions workflow file automates the process of building and deploying the TypeScript SDK documentation to GitHub Pages. It triggers on pushes and pull requests to the main branch, builds the documentation, and deploys it to the GitHub Pages environment.

## Code Structure
The workflow consists of a single job named "build" with multiple steps that handle the checkout, dependency installation, documentation building, and deployment to GitHub Pages.
