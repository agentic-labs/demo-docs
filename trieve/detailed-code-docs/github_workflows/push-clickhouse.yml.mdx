title: "push-clickhouse.yml"
---

## High-level description
This GitHub Actions workflow is designed to create and push a Clickhouse Docker image to Docker Hub. It is triggered on pushes to the main branch that affect files in the 'analytics/clickhouse/' directory, or manually via workflow dispatch.

## Code Structure
The workflow consists of a single job named "clickhouse_image" with several steps that checkout the repository, set up Docker buildx, log in to Docker Hub, prepare metadata for the image, and finally build and push the Docker image.

## Symbols

### Workflow
#### Description
This GitHub Actions workflow is named "Create Clickhouse image" and is responsible for building and pushing a Clickhouse Docker image.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| github.workflow | string | The name of the current workflow |
| github.head_ref | string | The head ref or source branch of the pull request in a workflow run |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up concurrency to prevent multiple workflow runs for the same branch.
2. Defines triggers: manual dispatch and pushes to 'main' branch affecting 'analytics/clickhouse/**' files.
3. Runs a single job "clickhouse_image" on a custom runner.
4. Executes a series of steps to build and push the Docker image.

### Job: clickhouse_image
#### Description
This job builds and pushes the Clickhouse Docker image to Docker Hub.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks out the repository.
2. Sets up Docker buildx.
3. Logs in to Docker Hub using provided secrets.
4. Prepares metadata for the Docker image.
5. Builds and pushes the Docker image using the prepared metadata.

### Step: Checkout the repo
#### Description
This step checks out the repository code.

### Step: Setup buildx
#### Description
This step sets up Docker buildx for building multi-platform images.

### Step: Login to Docker Hub
#### Description
This step logs in to Docker Hub using provided secrets.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| username | string | Docker Hub username (from secrets) |
| password | string | Docker Hub password (from secrets) |

### Step: Docker meta
#### Description
This step prepares metadata for the Docker image, including tags and labels.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| tags | string | Generated tags for the Docker image |
| labels | string | Generated labels for the Docker image |

### Step: Build and push Docker image
#### Description
This step builds the Docker image and pushes it to Docker Hub.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| context | string | The build context directory |
| file | string | The path to the Dockerfile |
| push | boolean | Whether to push the image to Docker Hub |
| tags | string | Tags for the Docker image |
| labels | string | Labels for the Docker image |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| actions/checkout@v4 | To check out the repository code |
| docker/setup-buildx-action@v3 | To set up Docker buildx |
| docker/login-action@v3 | To log in to Docker Hub |
| docker/metadata-action@v5 | To prepare metadata for the Docker image |
| docker/build-push-action@v5 | To build and push the Docker image |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| concurrency.group | string | ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.head_ref }} | Defines the concurrency group for the workflow |
| concurrency.cancel-in-progress | boolean | true | Cancels in-progress runs of the same workflow |

## TODOs
There is a commented-out step for setting up QEMU, which might be needed for multi-platform builds in the future:
```yaml
# - name: Set up QEMU
#   uses: docker/setup-qemu-action@v3
```

Additionally, the build-push-action step has a commented-out `platforms` option, which suggests multi-platform builds might be considered in the future:
```yaml
# platforms: linux/amd64,linux/arm64
```
