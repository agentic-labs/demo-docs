title: "push-collapse-query-script.yml"
---

## High-level description
This GitHub Actions workflow is designed to build and push a Docker image for a Clickhouse Search Query Collapsing Script. It is triggered on pushes to the main branch that affect the 'docker/collapse-query-script/' directory, or manually via workflow dispatch.

## Code Structure
The workflow consists of a single job named "build_collapse_query_script" with several steps that checkout the repository, set up Docker buildx, log in to Docker Hub, prepare metadata for the Docker image, and finally build and push the image.

## Symbols

### `name`
#### Description
Defines the name of the GitHub Actions workflow.

### `concurrency`
#### Description
Configures concurrency settings for the workflow to prevent multiple instances from running simultaneously.

### `on`
#### Description
Specifies the events that trigger the workflow: manual dispatch and pushes to the main branch affecting specific paths.

### `jobs`
#### Description
Defines the jobs to be executed in the workflow. In this case, there's only one job named "build_collapse_query_script".

### `build_collapse_query_script`
#### Description
The main job of the workflow that builds and pushes the Docker image.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks out the repository
2. Sets up Docker buildx
3. Logs in to Docker Hub
4. Prepares metadata for the Docker image
5. Builds and pushes the Docker image

## Notes
1. The QEMU setup step is commented out, suggesting that multi-architecture builds might have been considered but are not currently in use.
2. The workflow is configured to run on a custom runner: "blacksmith-2vcpu-ubuntu-2204".
3. The Docker image is tagged with "latest" and the commit SHA.
4. The build context and Dockerfile are located in the "docker/collapse-query-script/" directory.
