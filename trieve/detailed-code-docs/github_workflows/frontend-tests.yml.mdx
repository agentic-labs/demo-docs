## High-level description
This GitHub Actions workflow file defines a CI/CD pipeline for testing frontend components of a project. It runs on pull requests that modify files in the "frontends" or "clients/ts-sdk" directories, performing build tests and linting checks on various frontend applications.

## Code Structure
The workflow consists of two main jobs: `build-test` and `eslint`. These jobs run concurrently and independently, each performing specific tasks related to building and linting the frontend code.

### Workflow
#### Description
This GitHub Actions workflow is named "Frontends test suite" and is triggered on pull requests that modify specific paths in the repository.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| github.workflow | string | The name of the current workflow |
| github.head_ref | string | The branch or tag name that triggered the workflow run |

#### Internal Logic
1. Defines concurrency settings to manage multiple workflow runs.
2. Specifies the trigger event (pull requests) and paths to watch.
3. Defines two jobs: `build-test` and `eslint`.

### Job: build-test
#### Description
This job checks out the code, installs dependencies, and runs the build process for the frontend applications.

#### Internal Logic
1. Runs on a custom runner: `blacksmith-2vcpu-ubuntu-2204`.
2. Checks out the code using `actions/checkout@v4`.
3. Installs dependencies using `yarn --frozen-lockfile`.
4. Runs the build process using `yarn build`.

### Job: eslint
#### Description
This job performs linting checks on various frontend applications and annotates the results in the pull request.

#### Internal Logic
1. Runs on the same custom runner as the `build-test` job.
2. Checks out the code and installs dependencies.
3. Runs linting using `yarn lint:CI`.
4. Uses the `ataylorme/eslint-annotate-action@1.0.4` action to annotate linting results for each frontend application (Search, Chat, Dashboard, and Analytics).

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| actions/checkout@v4 | Checks out the repository code |
| ataylorme/eslint-annotate-action@1.0.4 | Annotates ESLint results in the pull request |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| GITHUB_TOKEN | secret | N/A | Used for authenticating GitHub API requests |

## Error Handling
The workflow uses the `if: always()` condition for the linting annotation steps, ensuring that all linting results are reported even if one of the steps fails.

Your response should not exceed 3000 words or 4000 tokens. Focus on providing clear, concise information that can be directly inferred from the code. Include optional sections only when they provide significant value for understanding the code.
