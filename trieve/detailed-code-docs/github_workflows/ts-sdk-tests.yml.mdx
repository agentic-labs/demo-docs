title: "ts-sdk-tests.yml"
---

## High-level description
This GitHub Actions workflow file defines automated tests and checks for the Typescript SDK of the Trieve project. It runs on pull requests that affect files in the `clients/ts-sdk` directory, performing build tests, unit tests, and linting.

## Code Structure
The workflow consists of two jobs: `build-test` and `tests`, each running on a specific Ubuntu runner. These jobs are triggered by pull requests that modify files in the Typescript SDK directory.

### Workflow
#### Description
This GitHub Actions workflow is named "Typescript SDK test suite" and is configured to run on pull requests affecting the Typescript SDK.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| github.workflow | string | The name of the current workflow |
| github.head_ref | string | The branch or tag name that triggered the workflow run |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up concurrency to cancel in-progress runs for the same workflow and branch.
2. Defines the trigger event as pull requests modifying files in `clients/ts-sdk/**`.
3. Specifies two jobs: `build-test` and `tests`.

### Job: build-test
#### Description
This job builds and tests the Typescript SDK.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks out the repository.
2. Installs dependencies using Yarn.
3. Builds the Trieve Typescript SDK using the command `yarn build --filter trieve-ts-sdk`.

### Job: tests
#### Description
This job runs unit tests and linting for the Typescript SDK.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks out the repository.
2. Installs dependencies using Yarn.
3. Runs unit tests using Vitest in the `./clients/ts-sdk` directory.
4. Runs linting in the `./clients/ts-sdk` directory.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| actions/checkout@v4 | To check out the repository code |
| yarn | Package manager used for installing dependencies and running scripts |
| vitest | Testing framework used for running unit tests |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| runs-on | string | blacksmith-2vcpu-ubuntu-2204 | Specifies the runner environment for the jobs |

## Error Handling
This workflow does not implement explicit error handling. It relies on GitHub Actions' default behavior of marking a job as failed if any step fails.

## Performance Considerations
The workflow uses concurrency settings to cancel in-progress runs for the same workflow and branch, which helps to conserve resources and ensure that only the latest code is being tested.
