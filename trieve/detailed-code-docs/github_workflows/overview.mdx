## High-level description
This directory contains GitHub Actions workflow files that define various automated processes for the Trieve project. These workflows cover a range of tasks including frontend testing, backend (Rust) testing, Docker image building and pushing, and TypeScript SDK documentation deployment.

## What does it do?
The workflows in this directory automate several key processes:

1. Frontend Testing: Runs build tests and linting checks on frontend applications when changes are made to relevant files.
2. Rust Backend Testing: Performs formatting checks, linting with Clippy, and OpenAPI specification generation for the Rust server code.
3. Docker Image Creation: Builds and pushes Docker images for various components of the application (frontend applications, server, workers, and utility scripts) to Docker Hub.
4. TypeScript SDK Documentation: Builds and deploys the TypeScript SDK documentation to GitHub Pages.
5. Clickhouse and Clustering Script Image Creation: Builds and pushes Docker images for Clickhouse and a clustering script.

These workflows ensure code quality, maintain up-to-date Docker images, and keep documentation current as the project evolves.

## Entry points
The main entry points for these workflows are:

1. `frontend-tests.yml`: Triggered on pull requests affecting frontend code.
2. `rust-tests.yml`: Runs on pull requests modifying server code.
3. `push-frontends.yml` and `push-server.yml`: Triggered on pushes to the main branch to update Docker images.
4. `ts-sdk-gh-pages.yml`: Builds and deploys TypeScript SDK documentation on pushes to main.

Each workflow file defines its own triggers, jobs, and steps, creating a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline for different aspects of the project.

## Key Files
1. `frontend-tests.yml`: Defines frontend testing processes.
2. `rust-tests.yml`: Outlines Rust backend testing and linting.
3. `push-frontends.yml`: Handles building and pushing frontend Docker images.
4. `push-server.yml`: Manages server-side Docker image creation and pushing.
5. `ts-sdk-gh-pages.yml`: Automates TypeScript SDK documentation deployment.
6. `push-clickhouse.yml` and `push-clustering-script.yml`: Create Docker images for Clickhouse and a clustering script.

## Dependencies
The workflows rely on several GitHub Actions and external tools:

1. `actions/checkout@v4`: Used in all workflows to check out the repository.
2. `docker/setup-buildx-action@v3`, `docker/login-action@v3`, `docker/metadata-action@v5`, `docker/build-push-action@v5`: Used for Docker-related operations.
3. `useblacksmith/cache@v5`: Used for caching in Rust workflows.
4. `clechasseur/rs-clippy-check@v3`: Used for Rust linting.
5. `actions/configure-pages@v3`, `actions/upload-pages-artifact@v1`, `actions/deploy-pages@v1`: Used for GitHub Pages deployment.

These dependencies are crucial for the proper functioning of the CI/CD pipelines defined in the workflows.

## Configuration
The workflows use various configuration options:

1. Environment secrets: `DOCKER_USERNAME` and `DOCKER_PASSWORD` for Docker Hub authentication.
2. GitHub secrets: `GITHUB_TOKEN` for GitHub API authentication.
3. Custom runners: Many jobs use a custom runner `blacksmith-2vcpu-ubuntu-2204`.
4. Concurrency settings: Used to manage multiple workflow runs and conserve resources.

These configurations ensure secure authentication, efficient resource usage, and proper execution environments for the workflows.
