## High-level description
This code defines a GitHub Actions workflow named "analytics test suite" that runs on pull requests modifying specific directories. It executes two jobs: "build-test" and "eslint" to ensure code quality in the "analytics" frontend module.

## Code Structure
The workflow is triggered on pull requests and runs two jobs in parallel: "build-test" and "eslint". Both jobs run on the "blacksmith-2vcpu-ubuntu-2204" runner.

## Symbols
### `analytics test suite`
#### Description
This workflow defines a test suite specifically for the "analytics" frontend module. It is triggered on pull requests that modify files within the specified paths and runs two jobs to build and lint the code.

#### Inputs
This workflow uses the default GitHub Actions event triggers and inputs. It is triggered on `pull_request` events and uses the event data to determine which files have changed.

#### Outputs
This workflow does not explicitly define any outputs. However, it produces logs and annotations as a result of the executed jobs.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Trigger:** The workflow is triggered on `pull_request` events where the modified files match the specified paths.
2. **Concurrency:** It uses concurrency to cancel any in-progress workflows for the same workflow and branch.
3. **Jobs:**
    - **build-test:** This job installs dependencies using `yarn` and then builds the "analytics" module.
    - **eslint:** This job installs dependencies and runs the linter on the "analytics" module. It then uses the `eslint-annotate-action` to annotate the code with linting results.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| actions/checkout@v4 | Checks out the repository code. |
| ataylorme/eslint-annotate-action@1.0.4 | Annotates code with ESLint results. |

## Error Handling
The workflow does not implement specific error handling beyond the default behavior of GitHub Actions. Any failing step will cause the job to fail.

## Logging
The workflow relies on the default logging mechanisms provided by GitHub Actions. Each step's output is logged and available in the workflow run details.
