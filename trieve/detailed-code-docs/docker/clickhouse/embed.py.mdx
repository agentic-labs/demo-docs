## High-level description
This Python script is designed to generate embeddings for input text using an external embedding server. It's part of a Docker-based ClickHouse setup and serves as a utility for processing text inputs and returning their corresponding embeddings.

## Code Structure
The script consists of three main functions: `completion_with_backoff`, `embed`, and the main loop. These functions work together to process input text, send requests to an embedding server, and return the resulting embeddings.

## Symbols

### `completion_with_backoff`
#### Description
This function sends a POST request to an embedding server to generate embeddings for the given input text.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| model_input | str | The input text to be embedded |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| embedding | list | The generated embedding for the input text |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the embedding server URL from an environment variable.
2. Prepares the request parameters and headers.
3. Sends a POST request to the embedding server.
4. Extracts and returns the embedding from the server's response.
5. Handles potential errors during the request or response processing.

### `embed`
#### Description
This function wraps the `completion_with_backoff` function, handling empty inputs and errors.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| text | str | The input text to be embedded |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | str or list | The embedding result, "NULL" for empty input, or "ERROR" on failure |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the input text is empty, returning "NULL" if so.
2. Calls `completion_with_backoff` with the input text.
3. Returns the embedding if successful, or "ERROR" if an exception occurs.

### Main Loop
#### Description
The main loop of the script that processes input from stdin and generates embeddings for each input line.

#### Internal Logic
1. Reads the number of lines to process from stdin.
2. Iterates over the specified number of lines.
3. For each line, calls the `embed` function and prints the result.
4. Flushes stdout after processing each batch.
5. Handles exceptions, printing error messages if they occur.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| sys | Handling stdin/stdout operations |
| requests | Making HTTP requests to the embedding server |
| os | Accessing environment variables |

## Error Handling
The script implements basic error handling:
- In `completion_with_backoff`, specific exceptions are caught and re-raised with more context.
- In `embed`, any exception results in returning "ERROR".
- In the main loop, exceptions are caught, and error messages are printed to stdout.

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| EMBEDDING_SERVER_URL | str | None | URL of the embedding server, set as an environment variable |
| request_timeout | int | 3 | Timeout for requests to the embedding server |

## Performance Considerations
The script processes inputs in batches, which can improve performance when dealing with multiple inputs. The batch size is determined by the input received from stdin.

This script is designed to work within a Docker container as part of a ClickHouse setup, as evidenced by the related Dockerfile. It's likely used as a custom function within ClickHouse for generating embeddings on-the-fly for text data stored in the database.
