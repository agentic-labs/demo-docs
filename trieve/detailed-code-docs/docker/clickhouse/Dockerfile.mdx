title: "Dockerfile"
---

## High-level description
This Dockerfile sets up a custom ClickHouse server image with additional configurations and a Python script for embedding functionality. It extends the official ClickHouse server image, adds custom configuration files, installs Python and necessary dependencies, and sets up the environment for running the embedding script.

## Code Structure
The Dockerfile consists of several steps to build the custom ClickHouse server image:
1. Base image selection
2. Configuration file copying
3. Python script setup
4. Dependency installation
5. Working directory setup
6. Python requirements installation
7. Command specification

## Symbols

### FROM clickhouse/clickhouse-server:latest
#### Description
Specifies the base image for the Docker build, using the latest version of the official ClickHouse server image.

### COPY (Configuration Files)
#### Description
Copies custom configuration files into the ClickHouse server directory.

#### Internal Logic
- Copies `config.xml` to `/etc/clickhouse-server/config.xml`
- Copies `embedding_function.xml` to `/etc/clickhouse-server/embedding_function.xml`
- Sets ownership of the files to the `clickhouse` user and group

### COPY (Python Script)
#### Description
Copies the `embed.py` Python script to the ClickHouse user scripts directory.

#### Internal Logic
- Copies `embed.py` to `/var/lib/clickhouse/user_scripts/embed.py`
- Sets ownership of the file to the `clickhouse` user and group

### RUN (Make Script Executable)
#### Description
Makes the `embed.py` script executable.

#### Internal Logic
Uses the `chmod` command to add execute permissions to the script.

### RUN (Install Dependencies)
#### Description
Updates the package list and installs Python 3 and pip.

#### Internal Logic
Uses `apt-get` to update package lists and install `python3` and `python3-pip`.

### WORKDIR /usr/src/app
#### Description
Sets the working directory for subsequent instructions to `/usr/src/app`.

### COPY requirements.txt ./requirements.txt
#### Description
Copies the `requirements.txt` file from the build context to the working directory in the image.

### RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
#### Description
Installs Python dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

### CMD ["/entrypoint.sh"]
#### Description
Specifies the command to run when the container starts, which is the ClickHouse server entrypoint script.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| clickhouse/clickhouse-server:latest | Base image for ClickHouse server |
| python3 | Runtime for the embedding script |
| python3-pip | Package installer for Python dependencies |

## References
The Dockerfile references the `embed.py` script, which is included in the related code snippets. This script is responsible for generating embeddings for text input using an external embedding server.

## Side Effects
- Modifies the base ClickHouse server image with custom configurations and additional functionality.
- Installs Python and related dependencies, increasing the image size.
- Sets up the environment for running the embedding script alongside the ClickHouse server.

## Performance Considerations
- The use of a custom Python script for embeddings may impact the overall performance of the ClickHouse server, depending on the frequency and scale of embedding operations.
- The installation of additional dependencies increases the image size, which may affect deployment time and resource usage.

This Dockerfile creates a custom ClickHouse server image with embedded Python functionality for text embeddings, combining database capabilities with machine learning features in a single container.
