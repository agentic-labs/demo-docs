## High-level description
This directory contains configuration files and resources for setting up a custom Keycloak instance using Docker. It includes a Dockerfile for building a custom Keycloak image, a realm configuration file, and a custom theme for the login page.

## What does it do?
This setup creates a customized Keycloak authentication server with the following features:

1. A custom realm named "trieve" with pre-configured settings for authentication, authorization, and identity management.
2. Integration with external identity providers (Google and GitHub) for user authentication.
3. A custom login theme that provides a branded look and feel, supporting both light and dark modes.
4. Custom client applications configured for various purposes, including account management and administration.

The Docker configuration allows for easy deployment of this customized Keycloak instance, ensuring consistency across different environments.

## Key Files

1. **Dockerfile**: This file defines how to build the custom Keycloak Docker image. It's based on the official Keycloak 23.0.7 image and includes the following customizations:
   - Copies a custom theme named "trieve" into the Keycloak themes directory.
   - Adds a realm export file for importing during startup.
   - Sets up a custom entrypoint script for container initialization.

2. **realm-export.json**: This JSON file contains the complete configuration for the "trieve" realm in Keycloak. It defines:
   - Realm settings such as token lifespans and security configurations.
   - Client applications that can use the realm for authentication.
   - External identity providers (Google and GitHub).
   - Authentication flows for various scenarios (browser-based, direct grant, registration, etc.).
   - Roles and client scopes.

3. **themes/trieve/login/resources/css/login.css**: This CSS file defines the custom login theme for the Keycloak instance. It includes:
   - Color schemes for both light and dark modes.
   - Custom styling for form inputs, buttons, and layout elements.
   - Branding elements such as a custom logo.

## Dependencies
The main dependency for this setup is Keycloak version 23.0.7, which is used as the base image in the Dockerfile. The custom theme also relies on Google Fonts (Maven Pro) for typography.

## Configuration
The configuration is primarily defined in the `realm-export.json` file, which includes:

1. Realm settings:
   - Registration is allowed, and email is used as the username.
   - Password is the required credential.
   - Various token and session lifespans are defined.

2. Client applications:
   - Pre-configured clients for account management, administration, and a custom "vault" application.

3. Identity Providers:
   - Google and GitHub are set up as external authentication providers.

4. Authentication Flows:
   - Custom flows for browser-based authentication, direct grants, registration, and password reset.

The custom theme (`login.css`) can be further customized by modifying the CSS variables defined at the top of the file, allowing for easy branding adjustments.

## Notes
- The Dockerfile runs the container as root (USER 0), which may have security implications. Consider using a non-root user if possible.
- The custom entrypoint script (`docker-entrypoint.sh`) is referenced in the Dockerfile but not provided in this directory. It's likely responsible for starting Keycloak with the imported realm configuration.
- The custom theme supports both light and dark modes, adapting to user preferences automatically.
- Some CSS styles use `!important` declarations, which may make future maintenance more challenging but ensure overriding of default Keycloak styles.
