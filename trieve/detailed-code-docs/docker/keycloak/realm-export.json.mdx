## High-level description

This JSON file represents a Keycloak realm configuration for a realm named "trieve". It defines various settings, roles, clients, and authentication flows for the Keycloak identity and access management system. The configuration includes settings for user authentication, client applications, and identity providers.

## Code Structure

The JSON structure contains several top-level keys that define different aspects of the Keycloak realm:

1. Realm settings (e.g., id, realm name, enabled status)
2. Roles (realm roles and client roles)
3. Clients (configured applications that can use Keycloak for authentication)
4. Client scopes (predefined sets of claims and roles)
5. Users and groups
6. Authentication flows
7. Identity providers
8. Required actions

Each of these sections contains detailed configurations for their respective components.

## Symbols

### Realm Configuration
#### Description
The root object defines the overall configuration for the "trieve" realm.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets up basic realm properties like access token lifespans, SSL requirements, and user registration settings.
- Configures default roles, required credentials, and browser security headers.

### Roles
#### Description
Defines the roles available in the realm, including both realm-level and client-specific roles.

#### Internal Logic
- Establishes a hierarchy of roles with composite roles inheriting permissions from other roles.
- Defines default roles for new users.

### Clients
#### Description
Configures the client applications that can use this Keycloak realm for authentication.

#### Internal Logic
- Specifies client settings such as client ID, redirect URIs, and allowed flows.
- Sets up client-specific roles and protocol mappers.

### Client Scopes
#### Description
Defines reusable sets of claims and roles that can be assigned to clients.

#### Internal Logic
- Creates predefined scopes like "profile", "email", and "roles" with associated protocol mappers.

### Authentication Flows
#### Description
Configures the sequences of authentication steps for different scenarios (e.g., browser login, registration).

#### Internal Logic
- Defines execution order and requirements for various authentication mechanisms.
- Sets up conditional flows for multi-factor authentication.

### Identity Providers
#### Description
Configures external identity providers (Google and GitHub) for social login.

#### Internal Logic
- Specifies provider-specific settings like client IDs and secrets.
- Configures trust settings and profile synchronization options.

## Dependencies
The configuration relies on Keycloak's internal components and may interact with external services:

- OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0 protocols
- SMTP server for email actions
- Google and GitHub for social login

## Error Handling
Error handling is not explicitly defined in this configuration file. It would be managed by the Keycloak server implementation.

## Performance Considerations
- Token lifespans and session timeouts are configured to balance security and user experience.
- Caching and offline session settings can impact performance and resource usage.

This configuration file serves as a blueprint for setting up a Keycloak realm with specific authentication and authorization rules for the "trieve" application ecosystem.
