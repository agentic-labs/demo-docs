## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|

## Side Effects
This CSS file may override default Keycloak styles and affect the appearance of the login page and related screens.

## Performance Considerations
The use of Google Fonts may impact page load time slightly, as it requires an additional HTTP request to fetch the font files.

## Notes
- The theme supports both light and dark modes using CSS custom properties and a media query.
- Some styles use `!important` declarations, which may make future maintenance more challenging.
- The theme includes a custom logo, loaded via a background image in the header.
