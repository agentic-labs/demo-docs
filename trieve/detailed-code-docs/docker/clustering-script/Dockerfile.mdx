title: "Dockerfile"
---

## High-level description
This Dockerfile defines the environment for running a Python-based clustering script. It sets up a lightweight Python 3.9 container, installs required dependencies, and configures the container to execute the `get_clusters.py` script when launched.

## Symbols

### Base Image
#### Description
The Dockerfile uses the official Python 3.9 slim image as its base.

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim
```

This provides a minimal Python 3.9 runtime environment, reducing the overall container size.

### Working Directory
#### Description
Sets the working directory inside the container to `/app`.

```dockerfile
WORKDIR /app
```

All subsequent commands will be executed relative to this directory.

### Dependency Installation
#### Description
Copies the `requirements.txt` file into the container and installs the Python packages listed in it.

```dockerfile
COPY requirements.txt /app/requirements.txt
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
```

The `--no-cache-dir` flag is used to reduce the image size by not caching the downloaded packages.

### Application Code
#### Description
Copies the `get_clusters.py` script into the container.

```dockerfile
COPY get_clusters.py /app/get_clusters.py
```

### Execution Command
#### Description
Specifies the command to run when the container starts.

```dockerfile
CMD ["python", "get_clusters.py"]
```

This will execute the `get_clusters.py` script using Python.

## Dependencies
The Dockerfile indirectly references external dependencies through the `requirements.txt` file. The specific libraries required for the clustering script are not visible in this Dockerfile but would be listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

## Notes
1. This Dockerfile creates a self-contained environment for running a clustering script, suggesting that the application is focused on data analysis or machine learning tasks.
2. The use of a slim Python image and the `--no-cache-dir` flag during package installation indicates an effort to keep the container size minimal.
3. The Dockerfile assumes that `requirements.txt` and `get_clusters.py` are present in the same directory as the Dockerfile when building the image.
4. There is no explicit error handling or logging configuration in the Dockerfile itself. Any such mechanisms would need to be implemented within the `get_clusters.py` script.
5. The container is set up to run a single Python script and exit, which is suitable for batch processing or one-time analysis tasks.
