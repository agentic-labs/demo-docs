## High-level description
This directory contains Docker configurations and related files for setting up various components of a larger system. It includes custom setups for ClickHouse (a database server with embedding capabilities), a clustering script for analyzing search queries, a query collapse script for optimizing search analytics, and a customized Keycloak instance for authentication and identity management.

## What does it do?
The Docker configurations in this directory enable the deployment of several interconnected services:

1. A ClickHouse database server with added functionality for generating text embeddings, allowing for efficient storage and analysis of text data along with their semantic representations.

2. A clustering service that analyzes search query data stored in ClickHouse, applying the HDBSCAN algorithm to cluster queries and generate topic names using AI.

3. A query collapse service that optimizes search analytics by identifying and marking redundant partial queries within a specific time window.

4. A customized Keycloak authentication server with pre-configured realms, client applications, and external identity providers, featuring a branded login theme.

These services work together to provide a robust backend for a search-centric application with advanced analytics capabilities and secure authentication.

## Key Files

1. ClickHouse setup (`docker/clickhouse`):
   - `Dockerfile`: Builds a custom ClickHouse image with embedding capabilities.
   - `embed.py`: Python script for generating text embeddings.

2. Clustering script (`docker/clustering-script`):
   - `Dockerfile`: Sets up a Python environment for the clustering script.
   - `get_clusters.py`: Performs HDBSCAN clustering on search queries and generates topics.

3. Query collapse script (`docker/collapse-query-script`):
   - `Dockerfile`: Configures a Python environment for the collapse script.
   - `collapse_queries.py`: Identifies and marks redundant partial queries.

4. Keycloak setup (`docker/keycloak`):
   - `Dockerfile`: Builds a custom Keycloak image with realm configuration and custom theme.
   - `realm-export.json`: Defines the "trieve" realm configuration.
   - `themes/trieve/login/resources/css/login.css`: Custom login theme stylesheet.

## Dependencies
The services rely on various external dependencies:

1. ClickHouse Server (latest version)
2. Python 3.9 (for clustering and query collapse scripts)
3. Keycloak 23.0.7
4. Various Python libraries including clickhouse_connect, numpy, sklearn, anthropic, and dotenv
5. External embedding server (for ClickHouse text embedding)
6. Claude AI (for generating cluster topic names)

## Configuration
Each service uses specific configuration methods:

1. ClickHouse:
   - Custom XML configurations (`config.xml`, `embedding_function.xml`)
   - `EMBEDDING_SERVER_URL` environment variable

2. Clustering script:
   - Environment variables for database connection and Anthropic API key

3. Query collapse script:
   - Environment variables for database connection
   - Configurable batch size and time window for query analysis

4. Keycloak:
   - Realm configuration in `realm-export.json`
   - Custom theme CSS for branding and light/dark mode support

These Docker configurations allow for flexible deployment of a complex system with data storage, analytics, and authentication components, suitable for a search-centric application with advanced features.
