## High-level description
This directory contains Docker-related files and scripts for various components of a search and analytics system. It includes configurations for ClickHouse database operations, clustering algorithms for search queries, query optimization scripts, and Keycloak authentication customization.

## What does it do?
The contents of this directory serve several purposes:

1. Text Embedding: Generates embeddings for input text using an external embedding server, likely for use in search or analytics operations.

2. Search Query Clustering: Implements a system to cluster search queries using HDBSCAN algorithm and generate topic names using the Claude API.

3. Query Optimization: Collapses similar search queries in a ClickHouse database to reduce redundancy and improve analytics accuracy.

4. Authentication: Customizes Keycloak for user authentication and authorization in the "trieve" application.

These components work together to provide a comprehensive solution for processing, analyzing, and optimizing search queries while ensuring secure user access.

## Key Files

1. `clickhouse/`: Contains a Python script for generating text embeddings using an external server.

2. `clustering-script/`: Implements HDBSCAN clustering for search queries and topic generation using the Claude API.

3. `collapse-query-script/`: Contains a Python script and README for optimizing search queries by collapsing similar ones in a ClickHouse database.

4. `keycloak/`: Includes configuration files for customizing Keycloak authentication for the "trieve" application.

## Dependencies
The scripts in this directory rely on several external libraries and services:

- ClickHouse: Used as the primary database for storing and querying search data.
- HDBSCAN: Employed for clustering search queries.
- Claude API: Used for generating topic names for query clusters.
- Keycloak: Provides authentication and authorization services.
- Python libraries: requests, numpy, sklearn, anthropic, dotenv, and others for various data processing and API interactions.

## Configuration
Configuration is primarily managed through environment variables, likely loaded from .env files. Key configuration points include:

- ClickHouse database connection details
- Embedding server URL
- Claude API credentials
- Keycloak realm and client settings

## Code Snippet
Here's an example of the clustering logic used in the search query analysis:

```python
def hdbscan_clustering(data):
    vectors = [row[3] for row in data]
    hdb = HDBSCAN(min_cluster_size=5, min_samples=3, cluster_selection_epsilon=0.5)
    hdb.fit(vectors)
    return hdb
```

This function performs HDBSCAN clustering on the input data, which are likely vector representations of search queries. The clustering helps identify groups of similar queries for further analysis and optimization.

In summary, this Docker directory contains a set of interconnected components that work together to process, analyze, and optimize search queries while providing secure authentication. It combines database operations, machine learning techniques, and custom authentication to create a robust search and analytics system.
