title: "pv.yaml"
---

## High-level description
This code defines a Kubernetes PersistentVolume (PV) template for a local development environment. It dynamically sets the PV name and storage size based on the provided `environment` and `NAME` values.

## Code Structure
This code uses Go templating to dynamically generate a Kubernetes YAML file. It uses conditional statements and variables to customize the output based on provided values.

## Symbols
### `$.Values.environment`
#### Description
This variable checks the value of the `environment` field in the provided values. It is used to determine if the PV should be configured for a local environment.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a variable reference.

#### Outputs
- `true` if the `environment` is "local".
- `false` otherwise.

### `$NAME`
#### Description
This variable represents the base name for the PV. It is expected to be provided externally.

### `ternary`
#### Description
This is a Go template function that implements a ternary operator. It takes three arguments: a condition, a value if the condition is true, and a value if the condition is false.

#### Inputs
- **condition:** The condition to evaluate.
- **trueValue:** The value to return if the condition is true.
- **falseValue:** The value to return if the condition is false.

#### Outputs
- The `trueValue` if the condition is true.
- The `falseValue` if the condition is false.

### `eq`
#### Description
This is a Go template function that checks if two values are equal.

#### Inputs
- **value1:** The first value to compare.
- **value2:** The second value to compare.

#### Outputs
- `true` if the values are equal.
- `false` otherwise.

## Configuration
This code relies on external values to be provided, likely through a Helm chart or similar templating engine. The following values are used:

| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| `environment` | string | The environment for which the PV is being configured. |
| `NAME` | string | The base name for the PV. |

## Side Effects
This code itself does not have any side effects as it is a template. When rendered with specific values, it generates a Kubernetes YAML file that, when applied, creates a PersistentVolume resource.

## Dependencies
This code relies on the Go templating engine for its functionality.
