## High-level description
This YAML template defines a Kubernetes PersistentVolume (PV) resource. It is conditionally rendered only for the local environment and sets up a host path-based storage volume with configurable name and capacity.

### Template
#### Description
This YAML template creates a PersistentVolume resource for Kubernetes, specifically for local environment usage.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| $.Values.environment | string | The environment in which the template is being rendered |
| .Values.environment | string | The environment value, used to determine storage capacity |
| $NAME | string | A variable that should be defined externally, used in the PV name |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the environment is "local" using a conditional statement.
2. Defines two variables:
   - `$${p}name`: Sets the PV name by appending "-pv" to the `$NAME` variable.
   - `$${p}storage`: Determines the storage capacity based on the environment.
3. Defines the PersistentVolume resource with the following specifications:
   - `metadata.name`: Uses the `$${p}name` variable.
   - `spec.capacity.storage`: Uses the `$${p}storage` variable.
   - `spec.accessModes`: Set to ReadWriteOnce.
   - `spec.persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy`: Set to Retain.
   - `spec.storageClassName`: Set to an empty string.
   - `spec.hostPath.path`: Set to "/{{ $${p}name }}".

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| storage | string | "10Gi" for local, "500Gi" for non-local | Defines the storage capacity of the PersistentVolume |

## Notes
1. The template uses the `$${p}` syntax, which is likely a placeholder for a specific template engine's variable notation.
2. The PersistentVolume is only created for the local environment, as indicated by the conditional statement at the beginning of the template.
3. The storage capacity is set to 10Gi for local environment and 500Gi for other environments.
4. The PersistentVolume uses a hostPath configuration, which is suitable for local development but not recommended for production environments.
