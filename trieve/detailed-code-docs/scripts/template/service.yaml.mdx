### Service Definition
#### Description
This YAML template defines a Kubernetes Service resource. It uses variables to allow for customization of the service name and selector.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up variables for the service name and selector using the `$NAME` placeholder.
2. Defines the Service resource with metadata, including various labels.
3. Specifies the service type as ClusterIP.
4. Configures two ports: one on 9000 and another on 42625.
5. Sets up a selector to identify the pods this service will route traffic to.

## Dependencies
This template is likely part of a Helm chart, as evidenced by the Helm-specific labels and the use of templating syntax.

### Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| $NAME | string | N/A | Placeholder for the service name, used in naming and labeling |

## API/Interface Reference
| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| :9000 | N/A | N/A | N/A | Main service port |
| :42625 | N/A | N/A | N/A | Secondary service port |

Note: The actual endpoints and their functionality would depend on the application running in the associated pods.
