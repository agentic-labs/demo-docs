## High-level description
This directory contains Kubernetes resource templates for deploying an application using Helm. The templates define a Deployment, PersistentVolume (PV), PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC), and Service for a containerized application. These templates are designed to be flexible and customizable across different environments, particularly distinguishing between local and AWS deployments.

## What does it do?
These templates work together to set up a complete Kubernetes deployment for an application:

1. The Deployment template creates pods running the application container, configuring environment variables, ports, and volume mounts.
2. The PersistentVolume template (for local environments only) sets up a storage volume on the host.
3. The PersistentVolumeClaim template requests persistent storage for the application, with different configurations for local and AWS environments.
4. The Service template exposes the application within the cluster, making it accessible on specific ports.

Together, these resources ensure that the application has the necessary compute resources, storage, and networking setup to run effectively in a Kubernetes cluster.

## Key Files

1. **deployment.yaml**: This file defines the Kubernetes Deployment resource. It specifies how the application should be deployed, including:
   - Container image and tag
   - Environment variables
   - Port configurations
   - Volume mounts
   - Resource requests and limits

   The template uses variables and Helm templating syntax for customization, such as:
   ```yaml
   image: {{ .Values.accountId }}.dkr.ecr.{{ .Values.region }}.amazonaws.com/{{ $NAME }}:{{ .Values.containers.$NAME.tag }}
   ```

2. **pv.yaml**: This template creates a PersistentVolume for local environments. It uses a hostPath configuration and sets different storage capacities based on the environment:
   ```yaml
   {{- if eq $.Values.environment "local" }}
   {{- $${p}storage := ternary "10Gi" "500Gi" (eq .Values.environment "local") }}
   ```

3. **pvc.yaml**: This file defines the PersistentVolumeClaim, which requests storage for the application. It adapts to different environments:
   ```yaml
   {{- $${p}storage := ternary "10Gi" "500Gi" (eq .Values.environment "local") }}
   storageClassName: {{ ternary "gp2" "" (eq .Values.environment "aws") }}
   ```

4. **service.yaml**: This template sets up a Kubernetes Service to expose the application within the cluster:
   ```yaml
   spec:
     type: ClusterIP
     ports:
       - port: 9000
         targetPort: 9000
       - port: 42625
         targetPort: 42625
   ```

## Dependencies
These templates are designed to be used with Helm, a Kubernetes package manager. Helm processes the templates and injects values from a separate values file or command-line arguments.

The templates also assume the use of Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry) for container images, as evidenced by the ECR URL structure in the Deployment template.

## Configuration
The templates use various configuration options, primarily through Helm values:

1. `.Values.environment`: Determines the deployment environment (e.g., "local", "aws")
2. `.Values.accountId`: AWS account ID for ECR
3. `.Values.region`: AWS region for ECR
4. `.Values.containers.$NAME.tag`: Container image tag
5. `.Values.config.fixme`: Used for setting an environment variable in the Deployment

The `$NAME` variable is used throughout the templates and should be set to the application name.

Environment-specific configurations include:
- Storage size: 10Gi for local, 500Gi for other environments
- StorageClassName: "gp2" for AWS, empty string for others

These templates provide a flexible foundation for deploying applications across different environments, allowing for easy customization through Helm values and environment-specific logic.
