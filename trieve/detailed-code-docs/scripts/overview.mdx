## High-level description
The `scripts` directory contains essential bash scripts and Kubernetes resource templates for setting up, configuring, and deploying a self-hosted instance of Trieve. It includes two main bash scripts for system preparation and configuration, as well as a set of Kubernetes templates for deploying the application using Helm.

## What does it do?
The scripts and templates in this directory work together to:

1. Prepare a system for hosting Trieve by installing necessary dependencies like Docker, Caddy, and other required packages.
2. Configure the Trieve instance based on the system's capabilities (GPU, CPU, RAM) and user input.
3. Set up reverse proxy configuration using Caddy.
4. Modify environment files and Docker Compose configurations for self-hosting.
5. Configure Keycloak for authentication.
6. Define Kubernetes resources (Deployment, PersistentVolume, PersistentVolumeClaim, and Service) for deploying Trieve in a Kubernetes cluster using Helm.

## Key Files

1. **setup-self-hosting.sh**: This script prepares the system for hosting Trieve by:
   - Installing required packages (jq, git, caddy, curl, gawk)
   - Setting up Caddy web server
   - Installing Docker if not present
   - Providing error handling and informative messages

2. **configure-self-hosting.sh**: This script configures the Trieve instance by:
   - Detecting GPU architecture and system resources
   - Determining appropriate Docker Compose configuration
   - Generating Caddyfile for reverse proxy
   - Modifying environment files and Docker Compose configurations
   - Configuring Keycloak realm
   - Managing services and displaying DNS record information

3. **template/deployment.yaml**: Defines the Kubernetes Deployment resource for Trieve, specifying:
   - Container image and tag
   - Environment variables
   - Port configurations
   - Volume mounts
   - Resource requests and limits

4. **template/pv.yaml**: Creates a PersistentVolume for local environments, using hostPath configuration.

5. **template/pvc.yaml**: Defines the PersistentVolumeClaim, requesting storage for the application with environment-specific configurations.

6. **template/service.yaml**: Sets up a Kubernetes Service to expose the Trieve application within the cluster.

## Dependencies
The scripts rely on several external tools and libraries:

- Docker: For containerization of the Trieve application
- Caddy: As a web server and reverse proxy
- jq, git, curl, gawk: For various system operations and configurations

The Kubernetes templates are designed to be used with:

- Helm: For Kubernetes package management and template processing
- Amazon ECR: For container image storage (assumed in the Deployment template)

## Configuration
The bash scripts use environment variables and user input for configuration:

- `DOMAIN`: Specifies the domain for the Trieve instance
- GPU and system resource detection for optimal configuration

The Kubernetes templates use Helm values for configuration, including:

- `.Values.environment`: Deployment environment (e.g., "local", "aws")
- `.Values.accountId`: AWS account ID for ECR
- `.Values.region`: AWS region for ECR
- `.Values.containers.$NAME.tag`: Container image tag
- `.Values.config.fixme`: Used for setting an environment variable in the Deployment

Environment-specific configurations in the Kubernetes templates include:
- Storage size: 10Gi for local, 500Gi for other environments
- StorageClassName: "gp2" for AWS, empty string for others

These scripts and templates provide a comprehensive solution for deploying Trieve, whether as a self-hosted instance on a single system or as a scalable application in a Kubernetes cluster.
