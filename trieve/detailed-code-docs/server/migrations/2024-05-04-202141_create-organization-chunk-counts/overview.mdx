## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for creating and managing the `chunk_count` column in the `organization_usage_counts` table. The migration is designed to add a new column to track the aggregated chunk counts for each organization, calculated from the `dataset_usage_counts` table.

## What does it do?
The migration scripts in this directory perform the following tasks:

1. Add a new `chunk_count` column to the `organization_usage_counts` table.
2. Calculate the total chunk count for each organization by summing up the chunk counts from the `dataset_usage_counts` table, grouped by organization.
3. Update the `organization_usage_counts` table with the calculated total chunk counts.
4. Provide a way to revert these changes by dropping the `chunk_count` column if needed.

These scripts allow the system to maintain an up-to-date count of chunks used by each organization, which can be useful for tracking usage, billing, or resource allocation purposes.

## Key Files

### up.sql
This file contains the SQL statements to perform the migration:

1. It adds the `chunk_count` column to the `organization_usage_counts` table:

```sql
ALTER TABLE organization_usage_counts
ADD COLUMN chunk_count INT DEFAULT 0;
```

2. It calculates the aggregated chunk counts for each organization using a Common Table Expression (CTE):

```sql
WITH AggregatedCounts AS (
    SELECT d.organization_id, SUM(duc.chunk_count) AS total_chunk_count
    FROM dataset_usage_counts duc
    JOIN datasets d ON duc.dataset_id = d.id
    GROUP BY d.organization_id
)
```

3. It updates the `organization_usage_counts` table with the calculated values:

```sql
UPDATE organization_usage_counts o
SET chunk_count = ac.total_chunk_count
FROM AggregatedCounts ac
WHERE o.org_id = ac.organization_id;
```

### down.sql
This file contains the SQL statement to revert the migration:

```sql
ALTER TABLE organization_usage_counts DROP COLUMN chunk_count;
```

This statement removes the `chunk_count` column from the `organization_usage_counts` table, effectively undoing the changes made by the `up.sql` script.

## Dependencies
This migration relies on the existing database schema, particularly the following tables:
- `organization_usage_counts`
- `dataset_usage_counts`
- `datasets`

No external libraries or frameworks are used in these SQL scripts.

## Configuration
These migration scripts do not require any specific configuration. They are designed to be run as part of a database migration process, typically managed by an ORM or migration tool in the main application.

It's important to note that running these migrations will modify the database schema and potentially affect existing data. The `up.sql` script adds a new column and populates it with calculated data, while the `down.sql` script removes this column and its data. Proper backups and testing should be performed before applying these migrations to a production environment.
