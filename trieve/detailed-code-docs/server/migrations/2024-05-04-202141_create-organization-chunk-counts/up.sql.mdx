## High-level description
This SQL script updates the `organization_usage_counts` table by adding a new column `chunk_count` to store the aggregated chunk counts from the `dataset_usage_counts` table. 

The script performs this update in three steps: adding the new column, calculating the aggregated chunk counts, and updating the `organization_usage_counts` table with the calculated values.

## Code Structure
The code consists of three SQL statements executed sequentially. The first statement adds a new column to the `organization_usage_counts` table. The second statement uses a Common Table Expression (CTE) to calculate aggregated chunk counts from the `dataset_usage_counts` table. The third statement updates the `organization_usage_counts` table with the aggregated counts calculated in the CTE.

## Symbols
### `ALTER TABLE organization_usage_counts ...`
#### Description
This SQL statement adds a new column named `chunk_count` to the `organization_usage_counts` table. The column is of type `INT` and has a default value of `0`.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a SQL statement, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a SQL statement, not a function.

#### Internal Logic
The statement uses the `ALTER TABLE` command to modify the existing `organization_usage_counts` table. The `ADD COLUMN` clause specifies that a new column is being added. `chunk_count` is the name of the new column, `INT` defines its data type as integer, and `DEFAULT 0` sets the default value of the column to 0 for existing rows.

### `WITH AggregatedCounts AS (...) UPDATE organization_usage_counts ...`
#### Description
This SQL statement calculates the aggregated chunk counts for each organization from the `dataset_usage_counts` table and updates the `organization_usage_counts` table with these counts.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a SQL statement, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a SQL statement, not a function.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Calculate Aggregated Counts:**
    - A Common Table Expression (CTE) called `AggregatedCounts` is defined. 
    - The CTE selects the `organization_id` and the sum of `chunk_count` (aliased as `total_chunk_count`) from the `dataset_usage_counts` table.
    - It joins the `dataset_usage_counts` table with the `datasets` table on their respective `dataset_id` and `id` columns to get the corresponding `organization_id`.
    - The `GROUP BY` clause groups the results by `organization_id` to calculate the sum of `chunk_count` for each organization.

2. **Update `organization_usage_counts` Table:**
    - The `UPDATE` statement modifies the `organization_usage_counts` table (aliased as `o`).
    - It sets the `chunk_count` column of each row in `organization_usage_counts` to the corresponding `total_chunk_count` from the `AggregatedCounts` CTE (aliased as `ac`).
    - The `FROM` clause joins the `organization_usage_counts` table with the `AggregatedCounts` CTE on the condition that `o.org_id` is equal to `ac.organization_id`. This ensures that the correct `total_chunk_count` is used to update the `chunk_count` for each organization.
