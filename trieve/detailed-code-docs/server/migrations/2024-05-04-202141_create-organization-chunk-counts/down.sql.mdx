title: "down.sql"

## High-level description
This SQL migration file is designed to undo the changes made in the corresponding `up.sql` file. It removes the `chunk_count` column from the `organization_usage_counts` table in the database.

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE organization_usage_counts
#### Description
This SQL command modifies the structure of the `organization_usage_counts` table by removing a specific column.

#### Internal Logic
The command drops the `chunk_count` column from the `organization_usage_counts` table. This operation effectively removes the column and any data it contained from the table structure.

## Side Effects
- The `chunk_count` column and all its data will be permanently removed from the `organization_usage_counts` table.
- Any queries or application code that previously relied on the `chunk_count` column will no longer function correctly after this migration is applied.

## Dependencies
This migration file depends on the existence of:
1. The `organization_usage_counts` table in the database.
2. The `chunk_count` column within the `organization_usage_counts` table.

## Error Handling
No explicit error handling is implemented in this migration. If the table or column doesn't exist, the database system will likely raise an error when attempting to execute this command.

## TODOs
The comment at the top of the file, `-- This file should undo anything in `up.sql``, serves as a reminder and guideline for the purpose of this migration file. It ensures that this `down.sql` file correctly reverses the changes made by the corresponding `up.sql` file.
