## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for modifying the `chunk_group_bookmarks` table in a database. The migration adds a unique constraint to ensure the combination of `group_id` and `chunk_metadata_id` is unique within the table. The directory includes both "up" and "down" migration scripts to apply and revert the changes, respectively.

## What does it do?
The migration scripts in this directory perform the following actions:

1. The "up" migration adds a new constraint to the `chunk_group_bookmarks` table. This constraint ensures that no two rows in the table can have the same combination of `group_id` and `chunk_metadata_id`. This is likely implemented to maintain data integrity and prevent duplicate entries for the same group and chunk metadata combination.

2. The "down" migration removes the constraint added by the "up" migration. This allows the database to revert to its previous state if needed, removing the uniqueness requirement for the `group_id` and `chunk_metadata_id` combination.

These migrations help manage database schema changes in a controlled and reversible manner, allowing for easier version control and deployment of database modifications.

## Key Files

1. `up.sql`:
   This file contains the SQL script to apply the new constraint to the `chunk_group_bookmarks` table. The script uses the `ALTER TABLE` statement to add a unique constraint named `group_id_chunk_metadata_id_key` on the `group_id` and `chunk_metadata_id` columns.

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE chunk_group_bookmarks
   ADD CONSTRAINT group_id_chunk_metadata_id_key UNIQUE (group_id, chunk_metadata_id);
   ```

2. `down.sql`:
   This file contains the SQL script to revert the changes made by the `up.sql` script. It removes the constraint added to the `chunk_group_bookmarks` table.

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE chunk_group_bookmarks
   DROP CONSTRAINT group_id_chunk_metadata_id_key;
   ```

These files work together to provide a reversible database migration, allowing developers to apply and undo changes to the database schema as needed.

## Configuration
The migration scripts do not require any additional configuration. However, it's important to note the following:

1. The migration is identified by the timestamp in the directory name (2024-02-27-020430), which helps maintain the order of migrations.
2. The constraint name `group_id_chunk_metadata_id_key` is used consistently in both scripts, ensuring that the "down" migration correctly removes the constraint added by the "up" migration.
3. The table name `chunk_group_bookmarks` is hardcoded in the scripts, so any changes to the table name would require updating both migration scripts.

When running these migrations, ensure that the database user has the necessary permissions to alter tables and add/remove constraints. The specific command or tool used to apply these migrations will depend on the database management system and migration framework being used in the project.
