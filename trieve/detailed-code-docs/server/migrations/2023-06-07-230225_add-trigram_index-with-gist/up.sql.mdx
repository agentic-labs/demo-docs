## High-level description
This SQL script adds a new GIN index to the `card_metadata` table using the `pg_trgm` extension for fuzzy string matching on the `oc_file_path` column. 

## Symbols

### `CREATE EXTENSION pg_trgm`
#### Description
This statement ensures that the `pg_trgm` extension is installed in the database. This extension provides functions and operators for performing approximate string matching using trigram similarity.

#### Internal Logic
- Checks if the extension is already installed. If not, it installs the extension.

### `CREATE INDEX idx_gist ON card_metadata USING gin (oc_file_path gin_trgm_ops)`
#### Description
This statement creates a new GIN index named `idx_gist` on the `card_metadata` table. The index utilizes the `gin_trgm_ops` operator class for indexing the `oc_file_path` column using trigrams.

#### Internal Logic
- Creates a new index named `idx_gist`.
- Specifies the `card_metadata` table for the index.
- Uses the `GIN` index type, which is suitable for indexing data structures like arrays and full-text search data.
- Applies the `gin_trgm_ops` operator class to the `oc_file_path` column. This enables the index to utilize trigram matching for approximate string comparisons.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| pg_trgm | Provides functions and operators for trigram matching. |

## Side Effects
- Installs the `pg_trgm` extension if it's not already installed.
- Creates a new GIN index named `idx_gist` on the `card_metadata` table.

## Performance Considerations
- The GIN index with `gin_trgm_ops` is designed to speed up queries involving fuzzy string matching on the `oc_file_path` column.
- Creating an index might impact write performance slightly, but it significantly improves read performance for relevant queries.
