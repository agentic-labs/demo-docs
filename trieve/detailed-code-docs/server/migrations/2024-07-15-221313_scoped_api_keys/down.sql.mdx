title: "down.sql"

## High-level description
This SQL script performs a database migration that reverts a change made to the `user_api_key` table, specifically removing the `scopes` column. This suggests that the `up.sql` migration likely added this column.

## Symbols

### `ALTER TABLE user_api_key DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS scopes;`
#### Description
This SQL statement removes the `scopes` column from the `user_api_key` table if it exists. The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the statement executes successfully even if the column has already been removed.

#### Internal Logic
1. **`ALTER TABLE user_api_key`**: This part targets the `user_api_key` table for modification.
2. **`DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS scopes`**: This instructs the database to remove the column named `scopes` if it exists in the table. 

#### Side Effects
- The `scopes` column will be removed from the `user_api_key` table.
- Any data previously stored in the `scopes` column will be permanently deleted.
