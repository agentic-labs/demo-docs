## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for adding and removing a `scopes` column to the `user_api_key` table in a database. The migration is dated 2024-07-15 and is related to implementing scoped API keys functionality.

## What does it do?
These migration scripts modify the database structure to support scoped API keys. The "up" migration adds a new column called `scopes` to the `user_api_key` table, which allows storing multiple text values (likely representing different permissions or access levels) for each API key. The "down" migration removes this column, effectively reverting the changes made by the "up" migration.

This functionality enables more granular control over API key permissions, allowing users or administrators to define specific scopes or access levels for each API key. For example, one API key might have read-only access to certain resources, while another might have full read-write access.

## Key Files

1. `up.sql`:
   - Adds the `scopes` column to the `user_api_key` table.
   - The column is of type `text[]`, which is an array of text values in PostgreSQL.
   - Uses `IF NOT EXISTS` to ensure idempotency, preventing errors if the migration is run multiple times.

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE user_api_key ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS scopes text[];
   ```

2. `down.sql`:
   - Removes the `scopes` column from the `user_api_key` table.
   - Uses `IF EXISTS` to ensure the operation is safe even if the column has already been removed.

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE user_api_key DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS scopes;
   ```

## Configuration
These migration scripts don't require any additional configuration. They are designed to be run by a database migration tool (likely Diesel, given the project context) which will execute them in the appropriate order based on the timestamp in the directory name.

The timestamp `2024-07-15-221313` in the directory name indicates when this migration was created and helps maintain the correct order of migrations.

## Dependencies
These scripts are written in SQL and are specifically tailored for PostgreSQL, as evidenced by the use of the `text[]` data type. They don't rely on any external libraries or frameworks beyond the PostgreSQL database system itself.

In the broader context of the application:
- The migration tool (likely Diesel) would be responsible for executing these scripts.
- The application code (probably written in Rust, given the use of Diesel) would interact with this new database structure to manage scoped API keys.

## Side Effects
Executing these migrations will have the following effects:

1. When running `up.sql`:
   - The `user_api_key` table will gain a new `scopes` column.
   - Existing rows in the table will have `NULL` values in the new column unless a default is specified (which it isn't in this case).
   - The application code will need to be updated to handle this new column when creating, reading, or updating API keys.

2. When running `down.sql`:
   - The `scopes` column will be removed from the `user_api_key` table.
   - Any data stored in the `scopes` column will be permanently lost.
   - The application code will need to be reverted to a state where it doesn't expect or use the `scopes` column.

It's important to note that these migrations only change the structure of the database. They don't provide any mechanisms for populating the `scopes` column with data or migrating existing API keys to use scopes. Such logic would need to be implemented in the application code or through additional data migration scripts.
