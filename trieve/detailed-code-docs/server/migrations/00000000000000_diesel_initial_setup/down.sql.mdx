## High-level description
This SQL script defines a database migration that reverts the changes introduced by the Diesel ORM's initial setup. It specifically drops two helper functions: `diesel_manage_updated_at` and `diesel_set_updated_at`.

## Symbols
### `DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS diesel_manage_updated_at(_tbl regclass);`
#### Description
This statement attempts to drop the function `diesel_manage_updated_at`. The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the statement doesn't fail if the function doesn't exist. This function is likely used by Diesel to manage automatic updating of timestamps for updated_at columns.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| _tbl | regclass | The table name as a registered class. |

#### Outputs
None

#### Side Effects
- Drops the `diesel_manage_updated_at` function from the database if it exists.

### `DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS diesel_set_updated_at();`
#### Description
This statement attempts to drop the function `diesel_set_updated_at`. The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the statement doesn't fail if the function doesn't exist. This function is likely used by Diesel to set the value of updated_at columns.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

#### Side Effects
- Drops the `diesel_set_updated_at` function from the database if it exists.
