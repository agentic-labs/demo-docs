## High-level description
This SQL script is designed to revert the initial setup performed by Diesel, an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) and query builder for Rust. It removes helper functions that were created for managing timestamps in database tables.

## Symbols

### `DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS diesel_manage_updated_at(_tbl regclass)`
#### Description
This command removes the `diesel_manage_updated_at` function if it exists in the database. This function was likely used to manage the `updated_at` column for tables.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| _tbl | regclass | The table to manage the `updated_at` column for |

### `DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS diesel_set_updated_at()`
#### Description
This command removes the `diesel_set_updated_at` function if it exists in the database. This function was likely used to set the `updated_at` column to the current timestamp when a row is updated.

## Side Effects
- Removes the `diesel_manage_updated_at` function from the database if it exists.
- Removes the `diesel_set_updated_at` function from the database if it exists.
- May affect any existing database triggers or procedures that rely on these functions.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Diesel | ORM and query builder for Rust that generated this migration script |

## Error Handling
The script uses `IF EXISTS` clauses in the `DROP FUNCTION` statements to prevent errors if the functions don't exist in the database.

## TODOs
The script includes a comment indicating that it's safe to edit and that future changes will be added to existing projects as new migrations. This suggests that developers can modify this script if needed, but should be aware that Diesel may generate additional migrations for future changes.
