## High-level description
This SQL script creates a table named `messages` in a database. The table is designed to store messages associated with topics, including their content, role (system, user, assistant), token usage, and timestamps. 

## Symbols

### `CREATE TABLE messages`
#### Description
This SQL statement defines a new table named `messages` with its columns and constraints.

#### Inputs
This statement does not take any explicit inputs. It implicitly relies on the existing database schema.

#### Outputs
This statement creates a new table named `messages` in the database.

#### Internal Logic
The statement defines the following columns for the `messages` table:

* **`id`**: A universally unique identifier (UUID) serving as the primary key, ensuring each message has a unique identifier.
* **`topic_id`**: A UUID referencing the `id` column in the `topics` table, establishing a foreign key relationship. This links each message to a specific topic. The `NOT NULL` constraint ensures every message is associated with a topic.
* **`sort_order`**: An integer defining the order of messages within a topic. The `NOT NULL` constraint ensures this value is always provided.
* **`content`**: A text field storing the actual message content. The `NOT NULL` constraint mandates that every message has content.
* **`role`**: A string limited to 10 characters, indicating the message sender's role (system, user, assistant). It defaults to 'assistant' and uses a `CHECK` constraint to enforce only allowed values.
* **`deleted`**: A boolean flag indicating whether a message is deleted, defaulting to 'FALSE'.
* **`prompt_tokens`**: An integer representing the number of tokens used in the prompt for this message, defaulting to 0.
* **`completion_tokens`**: An integer representing the number of tokens used in the completion for this message, defaulting to 0.
* **`created_at`**: A timestamp recording the message creation time. The `NOT NULL` constraint ensures this value is always recorded.
* **`updated_at`**: A timestamp recording the last message update time. The `NOT NULL` constraint ensures this value is always recorded.

## References
- This script references the `topics` table through the `topic_id` foreign key constraint. This implies the existence of a `topics` table in the database. 

## Side Effects
- This script modifies the database schema by creating the `messages` table.
