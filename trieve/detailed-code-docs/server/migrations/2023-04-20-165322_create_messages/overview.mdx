## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for creating and dropping the `messages` table in a database. It consists of two files: `up.sql` for creating the table and `down.sql` for dropping it. These scripts are part of a database migration system, likely used in a server application that handles messaging functionality.

## What does it do?
The migration scripts in this directory manage the lifecycle of the `messages` table in the database. Here's what they do in simple terms:

1. The `up.sql` script creates a new table called `messages`. This table is designed to store individual messages that are part of larger conversations or topics. Each message has various attributes like who sent it, what it says, and how long it is.

2. The `down.sql` script does the opposite. It's used to remove the `messages` table from the database if needed, like when you want to undo the changes made by the `up.sql` script.

These scripts help developers manage changes to the database structure over time, making it easier to update the application's data storage needs or roll back changes if something goes wrong.

## Key Files

1. `up.sql`: This file contains the SQL commands to create the `messages` table. It defines the structure of the table, including all the columns and their data types, as well as constraints and default values.

2. `down.sql`: This file contains the SQL command to drop the `messages` table. It's used to reverse the changes made by the `up.sql` script.

## Configuration
The migration scripts don't use any external configuration files or environment variables. However, they do rely on certain assumptions about the database structure:

1. The `up.sql` script assumes the existence of a `topics` table, as it creates a foreign key relationship with this table.

2. The `role` column in the `messages` table is configured to only accept specific values: 'system', 'user', or 'assistant'.

Here's a detailed explanation of the `messages` table structure created by the `up.sql` script:

```sql
CREATE TABLE messages (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    topic_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES topics(id),
    sort_order INTEGER NOT NULL,
    content TEXT NOT NULL,
    role VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'assistant' CHECK (role IN ('system', 'user', 'assistant')),
    deleted BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE,
    prompt_tokens INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    completion_tokens INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL
);
```

- `id`: A unique identifier for each message.
- `topic_id`: Links each message to a specific topic in the `topics` table.
- `sort_order`: Determines the order of messages within a topic.
- `content`: The actual text of the message.
- `role`: Indicates who sent the message (system, user, or assistant).
- `deleted`: A flag to mark messages as deleted without actually removing them from the database.
- `prompt_tokens` and `completion_tokens`: Used to track token usage, likely for API or billing purposes.
- `created_at` and `updated_at`: Timestamps for when the message was created and last updated.

The `down.sql` script is much simpler:

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS messages;
```

This command removes the `messages` table if it exists, allowing for a clean rollback of the migration.

These migration scripts provide a structured way to manage the database schema, ensuring that all instances of the application use the same data structure and can be updated or rolled back consistently.
