## High-level description
This SQL script handles the database migration rollback for dropping the `messages` table. It ensures that the table is deleted if it exists, preventing errors during rollback.

## Symbols

### `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS messages;`
#### Description
This SQL statement attempts to drop the table named `messages` only if it exists in the database.

#### Internal Logic
- **`DROP TABLE`**: This command is used to delete an existing table in the database.
- **`IF EXISTS`**: This clause checks for the existence of the table before attempting to drop it. If the table `messages` exists, it will be deleted. If it doesn't exist, the statement will not throw an error and the rollback process will continue.
- **`messages`**: This is the name of the table to be dropped.

#### Side Effects
This statement will permanently delete the `messages` table and all its data if it exists in the database.
