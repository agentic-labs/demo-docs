## High-level description
This SQL script defines a database migration that reverts a change made to the `users` table. Specifically, it removes the `organization_id` column, effectively undoing a relationship between users and organizations.

## Symbols

### `ALTER TABLE ... DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS`
#### Description
This SQL statement modifies the existing `users` table by dropping the `organization_id` column if it exists. The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the operation doesn't fail if the column is already absent, making the migration more robust.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a database migration script, not a function with explicit inputs.

#### Outputs
N/A - This statement modifies the database schema directly and doesn't return any output.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Check for Column Existence:** The database checks if a column named `organization_id` exists within the `users` table.
2. **Conditional Drop:** If the column exists, it is removed from the table structure. If not, the statement completes without taking any action.

#### Side Effects
- **Schema Modification:** The structure of the `users` table is permanently altered by removing the `organization_id` column.
- **Data Loss:** Any data previously stored in the `organization_id` column is irretrievably lost.

## Error Handling
The `IF EXISTS` clause provides a basic form of error handling. If the `organization_id` column doesn't exist, the script won't fail, preventing potential issues during migration rollback.
