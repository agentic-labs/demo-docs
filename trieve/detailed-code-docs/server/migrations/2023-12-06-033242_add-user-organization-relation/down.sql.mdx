## High-level description
This SQL migration file is designed to revert the changes made in the corresponding `up.sql` file. It removes the `organization_id` column from the `users` table if it exists.

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE users DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS organization_id
#### Description
This SQL statement removes the `organization_id` column from the `users` table if it exists.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `ALTER TABLE` command is used to modify the structure of the `users` table.
2. `DROP COLUMN` specifies that a column should be removed from the table.
3. `IF EXISTS` is used to prevent errors if the column doesn't exist in the table.
4. `organization_id` is the name of the column being removed.

## Side Effects
- This migration will modify the structure of the `users` table by removing the `organization_id` column if it exists.
- Any data stored in the `organization_id` column will be permanently lost when this migration is executed.

## Performance Considerations
- Dropping a column is generally a quick operation, but it may take longer if the table contains a large number of rows.
- This operation may briefly lock the `users` table, potentially affecting concurrent operations on the table during the migration.

## TODOs
The comment at the top of the file suggests that this migration should undo anything done in the corresponding `up.sql` file. It's important to ensure that this `down.sql` file correctly reverses all changes made in the `up.sql` file to maintain database consistency when rolling back migrations.
