## High-level description
This SQL script defines a function `update_messages_counts` and a trigger `update_messages_counts_trigger` to maintain the accuracy of message counts in the `organization_usage_counts` table. The trigger automatically updates the message count whenever a message is inserted or deleted from the `messages` table.

## Code Structure
The code defines two main SQL objects:

1. **`update_messages_counts` function:** This function is executed by the trigger and contains the logic to update the message counts.
2. **`update_messages_counts_trigger` trigger:** This trigger is defined on the `messages` table and calls the `update_messages_counts` function after each insert or delete operation.

## Symbols

### `update_messages_counts`
#### Description
This function updates the `message_count` in the `organization_usage_counts` table based on insert or delete operations on the `messages` table. 

#### Inputs
This function implicitly receives input from the trigger context:

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `NEW` | Record | Represents the new row being inserted into the `messages` table (available on INSERT). |
| `OLD` | Record | Represents the old row being deleted from the `messages` table (available on DELETE). |
| `TG_OP` | String | Indicates the triggering operation: 'INSERT' or 'DELETE'. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Trigger return value | Record | Returns the `NEW` record for INSERT operations, effectively returning the inserted row. This is a common practice for triggers, even if the returned value is not explicitly used. |

#### Internal Logic
1. **Determine Operation:** Checks the `TG_OP` variable to identify if the trigger was invoked by an INSERT or DELETE operation.
2. **INSERT Case:** If `TG_OP` is 'INSERT':
    - It attempts to insert a new row into `organization_usage_counts` with `org_id` from the related dataset and `message_count` set to 1.
    - If a row with the same `org_id` already exists, it increments the existing `message_count` by 1.
3. **DELETE Case:** If `TG_OP` is 'DELETE':
    - It decrements the `message_count` in `organization_usage_counts` for the corresponding `org_id`.
    - It ensures that `message_count` doesn't go below 0 by using a CASE statement.
4. **Return:** Returns the `NEW` record for INSERT operations.

### `update_messages_counts_trigger`
#### Description
This trigger automatically executes the `update_messages_counts` function after each INSERT or DELETE operation on the `messages` table.

#### Internal Logic
- It is defined as a `FOR EACH ROW` trigger, meaning it fires for each individual row inserted or deleted.
- It calls the `update_messages_counts` function, passing the implicit context (including `NEW`, `OLD`, and `TG_OP`) to the function.

## Side Effects
- **Modifies `organization_usage_counts`:** This trigger updates the `message_count` in the `organization_usage_counts` table to reflect the changes in the `messages` table.

## Performance Considerations
- **Potential Bottleneck:** This trigger could introduce a minor performance overhead for INSERT and DELETE operations on the `messages` table, as it performs additional updates on `organization_usage_counts`. However, the impact is likely to be minimal for typical workloads.
- **Optimization:** The use of `ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` in the INSERT case helps to optimize the update process by avoiding unnecessary rows and updates.
