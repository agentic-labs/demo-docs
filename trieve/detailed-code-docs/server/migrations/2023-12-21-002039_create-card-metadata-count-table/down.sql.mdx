## High-level description
This SQL script is designed to undo the changes made by the corresponding `up.sql` migration. It removes a trigger, a function, and a table related to card metadata counts in a database system.

## Symbols

### DROP TRIGGER card_metadata_count_trigger
#### Description
This command removes the trigger named `card_metadata_count_trigger` from the `card_metadata` table.

#### Internal Logic
The trigger is dropped without any conditions, completely removing it from the database system.

### DROP FUNCTION update_card_metadata_count()
#### Description
This command removes the function named `update_card_metadata_count()` from the database.

#### Internal Logic
The function is dropped without any parameters or conditions, completely removing it from the database system.

### DROP TABLE card_metadata_counts
#### Description
This command removes the entire `card_metadata_counts` table from the database.

#### Internal Logic
The table is dropped unconditionally, removing all its data and structure from the database.

## Side Effects
- Removal of the trigger will stop any automatic updates that were previously occurring on the `card_metadata` table.
- Deletion of the function will remove any logic that was being used to update card metadata counts.
- Dropping the `card_metadata_counts` table will permanently delete all data stored in that table.

## Dependencies
This script assumes the existence of the following database objects:
1. A trigger named `card_metadata_count_trigger` on the `card_metadata` table
2. A function named `update_card_metadata_count()`
3. A table named `card_metadata_counts`

If any of these objects do not exist when running this script, SQL errors may occur.

## Error Handling
This script does not include any explicit error handling. If any of the objects being dropped do not exist, the database system will likely raise an error, and the execution of the script may halt at that point.

## TODOs
The comment at the top of the file, `-- This file should undo anything in `up.sql``, suggests that this script is intended to revert changes made by a corresponding `up.sql` file. It's important to ensure that this `down.sql` script accurately undoes all changes made in the `up.sql` file to maintain database consistency during migrations.
