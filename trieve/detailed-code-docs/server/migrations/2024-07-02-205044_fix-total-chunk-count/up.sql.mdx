## High-level description
This SQL script migrates the `organization_usage_counts` table by fixing inconsistencies in the `chunk_count` column and ensuring its integrity through constraints and triggers. It updates existing NULL values, sets the column to NOT NULL, and implements a trigger to automatically update the count based on changes in the `dataset_usage_counts` table.

## Code Structure
The code first fixes existing data by updating NULL `chunk_count` values and then altering the column to be NOT NULL. It then updates `chunk_count` based on the sum of related counts from `dataset_usage_counts`. Finally, it defines a trigger `update_organization_chunk_count_trigger` that calls the `update_organization_chunk_count` function after any INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE operation on `dataset_usage_counts` to maintain data consistency.

## References
This script references the following tables:
- `organization_usage_counts`
- `dataset_usage_counts`
- `datasets`

## Symbols

### `UPDATE organization_usage_counts` (first occurrence)
#### Description
This statement updates the `organization_usage_counts` table, setting the `chunk_count` to 0 for any rows where `chunk_count` is NULL. This is done to prepare the column for the NOT NULL constraint.

#### Inputs
This statement doesn't take explicit inputs, but it operates on the `organization_usage_counts` table.

#### Outputs
The output is the modification of the `organization_usage_counts` table, specifically setting `chunk_count` to 0 where it was previously NULL.

### `ALTER TABLE organization_usage_counts`
#### Description
This statement alters the `organization_usage_counts` table to modify the `chunk_count` column. It sets the column to NOT NULL, ensuring that all future entries in this column must have a value.

#### Inputs
This statement doesn't take explicit inputs, but it operates on the `organization_usage_counts` table and specifically the `chunk_count` column.

#### Outputs
The output is the altered table schema of `organization_usage_counts` with the `chunk_count` column now having the NOT NULL constraint.

### `UPDATE organization_usage_counts o`
#### Description
This statement updates the `chunk_count` in the `organization_usage_counts` table based on the sum of `chunk_count` from related records in the `dataset_usage_counts` table. It joins the tables based on `dataset_id` and `organization_id` to ensure the correct counts are aggregated.

#### Inputs
This statement doesn't take explicit inputs, but it reads data from `organization_usage_counts`, `dataset_usage_counts`, and `datasets` tables.

#### Outputs
The output is the updated `organization_usage_counts` table with the correct `chunk_count` reflecting the aggregated values from related `dataset_usage_counts`.

### `CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_organization_chunk_count()`
#### Description
This statement defines or replaces a function named `update_organization_chunk_count`. This function is designed to be used as a trigger to automatically update the `chunk_count` in the `organization_usage_counts` table whenever there are changes (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) in the `dataset_usage_counts` table.

#### Inputs
This function implicitly takes the inserted, updated, or deleted row from the `dataset_usage_counts` table as input through the trigger context.

#### Outputs
The function returns the `NEW` row, representing the inserted or updated row in the `dataset_usage_counts` table. The main output is the side effect of updating the `organization_usage_counts` table.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Update `organization_usage_counts`**: It updates the `chunk_count` for the organization that owns the dataset affected by the trigger event.
2. **Calculate `chunk_count`**: It calculates the new `chunk_count` by summing the `chunk_count` from `dataset_usage_counts` for all datasets belonging to the organization.
3. **Return `NEW`**: It returns the `NEW` row, which represents the inserted or updated row in the `dataset_usage_counts` table.

### `CREATE TRIGGER update_organization_chunk_count_trigger`
#### Description
This statement creates a trigger named `update_organization_chunk_count_trigger`. This trigger is set to fire after any INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE operation on the `dataset_usage_counts` table. 

#### Inputs
The trigger implicitly takes the inserted, updated, or deleted row from the `dataset_usage_counts` table as input.

#### Outputs
The trigger itself doesn't have a direct output. Its output is the execution of the `update_organization_chunk_count` function, which updates the `organization_usage_counts` table.

#### Internal Logic
The trigger executes the `update_organization_chunk_count` function for each row affected by the triggering event (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) on the `dataset_usage_counts` table.
