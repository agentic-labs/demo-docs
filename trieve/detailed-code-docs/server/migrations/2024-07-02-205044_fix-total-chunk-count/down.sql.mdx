title: "down.sql"

## High-level description
This SQL script reverts the changes introduced by the migration `2024-07-02-205044_fix-total-chunk-count`. It aims to undo modifications made to the `organization_usage_counts` table, specifically related to the `chunk_count` column.

## Code Structure
The script executes a series of SQL statements in order to revert the database changes. It starts by undoing the `NOT NULL` constraint on the `chunk_count` column and then removes a trigger function named `update_organization_chunk_count`. Comments within the script indicate steps that are not strictly necessary for data reversal but were part of the original migration.

## Symbols

### `-- This file should undo anything in `up.sql``
#### Description
This is a comment indicating the purpose of the file. It highlights that this "down" migration script is designed to reverse the changes made by its corresponding "up" migration script.

#### Internal Logic
This is a comment and does not contain executable code.

### `-- Reverse setting chunk_count to 0 for NULL values (not necessary to reverse data update)`
#### Description
This comment explains that the following SQL statement was part of the original migration but is not strictly necessary to reverse. It suggests that setting `chunk_count` to `NULL` where it was previously `0` is not crucial for data integrity in the rollback.

#### Internal Logic
This is a comment and does not contain executable code.

### `UPDATE organization_usage_counts SET chunk_count = NULL WHERE chunk_count = 0;`
#### Description
This SQL statement was part of the original migration and is being retained in the down migration for potential data consistency, even though it's marked as not strictly necessary. It finds records in the `organization_usage_counts` table where `chunk_count` is `0` and sets those values to `NULL`.

#### Internal Logic
- **`UPDATE organization_usage_counts`**: This clause specifies the target table for the update operation.
- **`SET chunk_count = NULL`**: This clause sets the value of the `chunk_count` column to `NULL`.
- **`WHERE chunk_count = 0`**: This clause filters the rows to be updated, targeting only those where the `chunk_count` column currently holds a value of `0`.

### `-- Reverse altering the column to SET NOT NULL`
#### Description
This comment indicates that the following SQL statement is intended to reverse a change where the `chunk_count` column was made to not accept `NULL` values.

#### Internal Logic
This is a comment and does not contain executable code.

### `ALTER TABLE organization_usage_counts ALTER COLUMN chunk_count DROP NOT NULL;`
#### Description
This SQL statement removes the `NOT NULL` constraint from the `chunk_count` column in the `organization_usage_counts` table. This allows the column to accept `NULL` values again.

#### Internal Logic
- **`ALTER TABLE organization_usage_counts`**: This clause specifies the target table for alteration.
- **`ALTER COLUMN chunk_count DROP NOT NULL`**: This clause modifies the `chunk_count` column, specifically removing the constraint that prevented it from holding `NULL` values.

### `-- Reverse the update of chunk_count to the calculated sum (not necessary to reverse data update)`
#### Description
This comment explains that the following SQL statement, while part of the original migration, is not essential for reversing the data changes. It implies that reverting the calculation of `chunk_count` is not critical for data integrity during the rollback.

#### Internal Logic
This is a comment and does not contain executable code.

### `-- UPDATE organization_usage_counts SET chunk_count = NULL;`
#### Description
This SQL statement, commented out, was part of the original migration and is kept here for reference. It suggests that the original migration involved updating the `chunk_count` column with a calculated sum. However, it's marked as unnecessary for the rollback process.

#### Internal Logic
This is a comment and does not contain executable code.

### `-- Drop the trigger function`
#### Description
This comment indicates that the following SQL statement will remove a database trigger function.

#### Internal Logic
This is a comment and does not contain executable code.

### `DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS update_organization_chunk_count;`
#### Description
This SQL statement attempts to drop a function named `update_organization_chunk_count`. The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the statement executes without error even if the function does not exist. This is a common practice in rollback scripts to handle cases where the original migration might not have been successful in creating the function.

#### Internal Logic
- **`DROP FUNCTION`**: This clause initiates the process of removing a database function.
- **`IF EXISTS`**: This clause adds a conditional check to the statement. The function will only be dropped if it currently exists in the database.
- **`update_organization_chunk_count`**: This is the name of the function to be dropped.
