## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration files for creating and dropping a `stripe_customers` table in the database. The migration is dated 2023-05-06 and is specifically designed to manage Stripe customer information in relation to the application's user base.

## What does it do?
The migration creates a new table called `stripe_customers` that stores information about customers associated with Stripe, a popular payment processing platform. This table links Stripe customer data with the application's user data. The migration also provides a way to undo these changes by dropping the table if needed.

The `stripe_customers` table stores the following information:
- A unique identifier for each entry
- A Stripe-specific customer identifier
- The customer's email address (which is linked to the users table)
- Timestamps for when the entry was created and last updated

This setup allows the application to maintain a separate record of Stripe customers while ensuring a connection to the main user database through the email address.

## Key Files

1. `up.sql`: This file contains the SQL commands to create the `stripe_customers` table. It defines the table structure, including columns for id, stripe_id, email, and timestamps. It also sets up constraints such as primary key, unique fields, and a foreign key relationship with the `users` table.

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE stripe_customers (
     id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
     stripe_id TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
     email VARCHAR UNIQUE,
     created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
     updated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
     FOREIGN KEY (email) REFERENCES users(email)
   );
   ```

2. `down.sql`: This file contains the SQL command to drop the `stripe_customers` table, effectively undoing the changes made by the `up.sql` file.

   ```sql
   DROP TABLE IF EXISTS stripe_customers;
   ```

## Dependencies
This migration assumes the existence of a `users` table in the database, as it references the `email` column from that table in the foreign key constraint.

## Configuration
The migration files don't require any specific configuration. However, they are likely part of a larger database migration system, possibly using tools like Diesel for Rust or other similar ORM/migration tools. The naming convention of the directory (2023-05-06-205756_create_stripe_customers) suggests a timestamp-based migration ordering system.

## Notes
1. The `up.sql` file creates a table with strong data integrity constraints, including unique constraints on `id`, `stripe_id`, and `email`, as well as a foreign key relationship with the `users` table.
2. The `down.sql` file provides a safe way to drop the table, using the `IF EXISTS` clause to prevent errors if the table doesn't exist.
3. When applying these migrations, it's important to ensure that the `users` table exists and has an `email` column that can be referenced by the foreign key constraint.
4. The use of UUIDs for the primary key (`id`) suggests a distributed or high-volume system where traditional auto-incrementing integers might not be suitable.
5. The inclusion of `created_at` and `updated_at` timestamps indicates that the application tracks when Stripe customer records are created and modified.
6. The `email` field is allowed to be null, which might be useful in scenarios where a Stripe customer is created before a full user account is established.

These migration files provide a robust structure for managing Stripe customer data while maintaining a clear relationship with the application's user base. The ability to easily create and drop this table allows for flexible database management during development and deployment processes.
