## High-level description
This SQL script creates a new table named `stripe_customers` in the database. The table is designed to store information about customers associated with Stripe, a popular payment processing platform. It establishes a relationship between Stripe customers and users in the system.

### `stripe_customers` table
#### Description
The `stripe_customers` table is created to store essential information about Stripe customers. It includes fields for unique identifiers, email, and timestamps for creation and updates. The table also establishes a foreign key relationship with the `users` table.

#### Internal Logic
The table is created with the following columns and constraints:

1. `id`: A UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) that serves as the primary key for the table.
2. `stripe_id`: A unique text field to store the Stripe-specific customer identifier.
3. `email`: A varchar field to store the customer's email address, which can be null and is unique.
4. `created_at`: A timestamp field to record when the customer entry was created.
5. `updated_at`: A timestamp field to record when the customer entry was last updated.

The table also includes the following constraints:
- The `id` column is set as the primary key and must be unique.
- The `stripe_id` column must be unique.
- The `email` column is set as a foreign key referencing the `email` column in the `users` table.

## Dependencies
This migration script assumes the existence of a `users` table in the database, as it references the `email` column from that table.

## Performance Considerations
- The `id` and `stripe_id` columns are set as unique, which will likely have indexes automatically created for them by the database management system. This ensures fast lookups when querying by these fields.
- The `email` column is also set as unique and is used as a foreign key. This implies that there will be an index on this column as well, facilitating efficient joins with the `users` table and quick lookups by email.

## Error Handling
The SQL script includes several constraints that will cause errors if violated:
- Attempting to insert a duplicate `id`, `stripe_id`, or `email` will result in a unique constraint violation.
- Inserting an `email` that doesn't exist in the `users` table will result in a foreign key constraint violation.
- Inserting `NULL` values for `id`, `stripe_id`, `created_at`, or `updated_at` will result in a not-null constraint violation.

These constraints help maintain data integrity and consistency between the `stripe_customers` and `users` tables.
