title: "down.sql"
---

## High-level description
This SQL migration file is designed to undo the changes made by the corresponding `up.sql` file. It drops the `stripe_customers` table if it exists in the database.

## Symbols

### `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS stripe_customers;`
#### Description
This SQL command is used to remove the `stripe_customers` table from the database schema.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `IF EXISTS` clause is used to prevent errors if the table doesn't exist.
2. If the table exists, it will be completely removed from the database, including all its data and structure.

## Side Effects
- If the `stripe_customers` table exists, it will be permanently deleted from the database, along with all its contents.
- If the table doesn't exist, this command will have no effect on the database.

## Dependencies
This migration file is likely part of a database migration system, possibly using tools like Diesel for Rust or other similar ORM/migration tools.

## Error Handling
The `IF EXISTS` clause provides a basic form of error handling by preventing the command from failing if the table doesn't exist.

## Notes
1. This is a "down" migration file, typically used to revert changes made by a corresponding "up" migration.
2. It's important to ensure that this down migration accurately undoes all changes made by the related up migration to maintain database consistency.
3. Caution should be exercised when running this migration, as it will result in data loss if the table exists and contains data.
