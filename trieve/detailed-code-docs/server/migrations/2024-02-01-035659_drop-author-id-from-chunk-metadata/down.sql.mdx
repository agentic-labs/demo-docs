## High-level description
This SQL script reverts the changes made in the corresponding `up.sql` migration file, specifically re-adding the `author_id` column to the `chunk_metadata` table and restoring foreign key constraints related to the `users` table. This suggests that the `up.sql` migration likely removed the `author_id` column and its associated constraints. 

## Symbols

### `ALTER TABLE chunk_metadata ...`
#### Description
This statement adds the `author_id` column back to the `chunk_metadata` table. The column is of type `UUID`, cannot be null (`NOT NULL`), and references the `id` column of the `users` table as a foreign key.

#### Internal Logic
- `ALTER TABLE chunk_metadata`: This part specifies that the `chunk_metadata` table is being modified.
- `ADD COLUMN author_id UUID NOT NULL`: This adds a new column named `author_id` of type `UUID` that cannot be null.
- `REFERENCES users(id)`: This enforces a foreign key constraint, ensuring that every value in the `author_id` column corresponds to a valid `id` in the `users` table.

### `ALTER TABLE ... ADD CONSTRAINT ... FOREIGN KEY ...`
#### Description
These statements add back foreign key constraints to several tables, linking them to the `users` table via the `user_id` column. The `ON DELETE CASCADE` clause ensures that if a user is deleted, related records in these tables are also deleted.

#### Internal Logic
- `ALTER TABLE [table_name]`: This part specifies the table being modified.
- `ADD CONSTRAINT [constraint_name]`: This adds a new constraint with the specified name.
- `FOREIGN KEY (user_id)`: This defines the column `user_id` as the foreign key.
- `REFERENCES users(id)`: This specifies that the foreign key references the `id` column of the `users` table.
- `ON DELETE CASCADE`: This ensures that deleting a user will cascade and delete related records in the modified table.

The tables affected and their respective constraint names are:
- `user_organizations`: `fk_user_id`
- `user_api_key`: `user_api_key_user_id_fkey`
- `files`: `files_user_id_fkey`
- `topics`: `topics_user_id_fkey`
