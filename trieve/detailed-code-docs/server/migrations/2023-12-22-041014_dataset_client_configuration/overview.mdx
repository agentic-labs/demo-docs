## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for modifying the structure of the `datasets` table in a database. The migration introduces a new column for client configuration and renames an existing configuration column. The directory includes both "up" and "down" migration scripts to allow for applying and reverting these changes.

## What does it do?
The migration scripts in this directory perform the following operations:

1. Add a new column called `client_configuration` to the `datasets` table. This column is designed to store JSON data related to client-specific configurations for datasets.
2. Rename the existing `configuration` column to `server_configuration`, likely to distinguish it from the new client configuration.
3. Provide a way to revert these changes if needed, by dropping the newly added column and renaming the column back to its original name.

These changes allow the application to store separate configuration data for both server-side and client-side aspects of datasets, providing more flexibility and organization in managing dataset configurations.

## Key Files

### up.sql
This file contains the SQL commands to apply the migration:

```sql
ALTER TABLE datasets RENAME COLUMN configuration TO server_configuration;
ALTER TABLE datasets ADD COLUMN client_configuration JSONB NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}';
```

The script renames the existing `configuration` column to `server_configuration` and adds a new `client_configuration` column of type JSONB (JSON Binary) with a default empty object value.

### down.sql
This file contains the SQL commands to revert the migration:

```sql
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS client_configuration;
ALTER TABLE datasets RENAME COLUMN IF EXISTS server_configuration TO configuration;
```

The script drops the `client_configuration` column if it exists and renames the `server_configuration` column back to `configuration`.

## Configuration
The migration scripts use SQL commands that are likely compatible with PostgreSQL, given the use of the JSONB data type. The specific database configuration (such as connection details) is not included in these files and would typically be managed by the application's database connection settings or an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool.

Key configurable aspects in these scripts include:

1. Table name: `datasets`
2. Column names: `configuration`, `server_configuration`, `client_configuration`
3. Data type for `client_configuration`: JSONB
4. Default value for `client_configuration`: '{}'

These scripts assume that the `datasets` table already exists in the database. The use of `IF EXISTS` clauses in the `down.sql` script provides some flexibility, allowing the rollback to succeed even if the exact state of the database doesn't match expectations.
