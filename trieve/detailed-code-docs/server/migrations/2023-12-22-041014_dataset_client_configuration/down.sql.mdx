## High-level description
This SQL script performs database migration rollback operations, specifically reverting changes introduced in a migration related to dataset configuration. It removes a column named `client_configuration` and renames a column from `server_configuration` back to `configuration` in the `datasets` table.

## Symbols

### `DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS client_configuration;`
#### Description
This statement attempts to drop the column `client_configuration` from a table (likely the `datasets` table based on the context). The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the operation doesn't fail if the column doesn't exist.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Check for column existence:** The database checks if a column named `client_configuration` exists in the target table.
2. **Drop column (if exists):** If the column exists, it is dropped from the table structure. If it doesn't exist, the statement completes without taking any action.

### `ALTER TABLE datasets RENAME COLUMN IF EXISTS server_configuration TO configuration;`
#### Description
This statement renames the column `server_configuration` to `configuration` in the `datasets` table. The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the operation doesn't fail if the column `server_configuration` doesn't exist.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Check for column existence:** The database checks if a column named `server_configuration` exists in the `datasets` table.
2. **Rename column (if exists):** If the column exists, it is renamed to `configuration`. If it doesn't exist, the statement completes without taking any action.
