## High-level description
This SQL migration script removes the `user_id` column from the `files` table. This suggests a change in the application's data model, likely decoupling files from individual users.

## Symbols

### `ALTER TABLE files DROP COLUMN user_id`
#### Description
This SQL statement modifies the existing `files` table by removing the `user_id` column. 

#### Internal Logic
- **`ALTER TABLE files`**: This clause specifies that the `files` table is being modified.
- **`DROP COLUMN user_id`**: This clause instructs the database to remove the column named `user_id` from the `files` table.

#### Side Effects
- **Data Loss**: All data previously stored in the `user_id` column will be permanently deleted.
- **Schema Change**: The structure of the `files` table is permanently altered.

#### Performance Considerations
Dropping a column can be a time-consuming operation, especially for large tables. Consider the impact on performance if this migration is run in a production environment.
