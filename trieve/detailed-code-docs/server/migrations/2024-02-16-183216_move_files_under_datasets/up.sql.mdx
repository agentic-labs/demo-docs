## High-level description
This SQL migration script removes the `user_id` column from the `files` table. It's part of a database schema change, likely related to restructuring how files are associated with users or datasets.

### SQL Statement
#### Description
The SQL statement `ALTER TABLE files DROP COLUMN user_id` modifies the structure of the `files` table by removing the `user_id` column.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `ALTER TABLE` command is used to modify an existing table structure.
2. `files` is the name of the table being altered.
3. `DROP COLUMN` is the specific alteration being made, which removes a column from the table.
4. `user_id` is the name of the column being removed from the `files` table.

## Side Effects
- This migration will permanently remove the `user_id` column from the `files` table.
- Any data stored in the `user_id` column will be lost after this migration is executed.
- Any queries, views, or application code that previously relied on the `user_id` column in the `files` table will need to be updated to reflect this change.

## Performance Considerations
- Dropping a column is generally a fast operation, especially if the table is not very large.
- However, if the `files` table contains a large number of rows, this operation might take some time to complete and could potentially lock the table during the process.

## TODOs
The comment "-- Your SQL goes here" suggests that this might be a template or placeholder for migration scripts. In a production environment, it's recommended to remove or replace such comments with more specific documentation about the purpose of the migration.
