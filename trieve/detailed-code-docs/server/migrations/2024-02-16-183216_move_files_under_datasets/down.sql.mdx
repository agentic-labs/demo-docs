title: "down.sql"

## High-level description
This SQL migration file is designed to undo the changes made in the corresponding `up.sql` file. It adds a `user_id` column of type UUID to the `files` table.

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE files ADD COLUMN user_id UUID;
#### Description
This SQL statement adds a new column named `user_id` to the `files` table. The column is of type UUID (Universally Unique Identifier).

#### Internal Logic
1. The `ALTER TABLE` command is used to modify the structure of an existing table.
2. `files` is the name of the table being altered.
3. `ADD COLUMN` specifies that a new column is being added to the table.
4. `user_id` is the name of the new column.
5. `UUID` is the data type of the new column, which will store universally unique identifiers.

## Side Effects
- This migration will modify the structure of the `files` table by adding a new column.
- Any existing rows in the `files` table will have a `NULL` value for the new `user_id` column unless a default value is specified (which is not the case in this migration).
- This change may affect any queries or application code that interacts with the `files` table, as they may need to be updated to handle the new column.

## Performance Considerations
Adding a new column to an existing table can be a relatively quick operation in most database systems, especially if the table is not very large. However, for very large tables, this operation might take some time and could potentially lock the table during the process, depending on the database system and its configuration.

## Notes
- This is a "down" migration, meant to revert changes made by a corresponding "up" migration.
- The comment at the top of the file indicates that this script should undo anything done in the `up.sql` file.
- It's important to ensure that this down migration accurately reverses the changes made in the up migration to maintain database consistency when rolling back changes.
- The `user_id` column is added without any constraints (such as NOT NULL or FOREIGN KEY). If these constraints were removed in the up migration, they would need to be re-added in a separate statement if required.
