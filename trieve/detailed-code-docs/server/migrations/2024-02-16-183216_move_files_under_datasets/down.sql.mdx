title: "down.sql"

## High-level description
This SQL script reverts a database migration by adding back the `user_id` column to the `files` table. This suggests that the `up.sql` migration likely involved removing this column.

## Symbols

### `ALTER TABLE files ADD COLUMN user_id UUID;`
#### Description
This SQL statement modifies the existing `files` table by adding a column named `user_id` of type `UUID`. 

#### Internal Logic
- **`ALTER TABLE files`**: This clause specifies that the `files` table is being modified.
- **`ADD COLUMN user_id UUID`**: This clause adds a new column named `user_id` to the `files` table. The data type of this column is set to `UUID`, which typically represents a universally unique identifier. 

#### Side Effects
This statement directly modifies the schema of the `files` table in the database.
