## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for altering the `invitations` table in a database. The migration is specifically designed to change the name of a column from `dataset_id` to `organization_id`. The directory includes both "up" and "down" migration scripts to allow for applying and reverting the change.

## What does it do?
The migration scripts in this directory perform a simple but important task:

1. The "up" migration (in `up.sql`) renames the `dataset_id` column in the `invitations` table to `organization_id`. This change likely reflects a shift in the application's data model, where invitations are now associated with organizations rather than datasets.

2. The "down" migration (in `down.sql`) does the opposite, renaming the `organization_id` column back to `dataset_id`. This allows the change to be undone if necessary, maintaining backwards compatibility or allowing for rollbacks.

These changes affect how the application interacts with the database. After applying the "up" migration, any code that previously referred to `dataset_id` will need to be updated to use `organization_id` instead. The "down" migration provides a way to revert this change if needed.

## Key Files

1. `up.sql`: This file contains the SQL command to rename the column from `dataset_id` to `organization_id`. Here's the content:

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE invitations RENAME COLUMN dataset_id TO organization_id;
   ```

2. `down.sql`: This file contains the SQL command to revert the change, renaming the column back from `organization_id` to `dataset_id`. Here's the content:

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE invitations RENAME COLUMN organization_id TO dataset_id;
   ```

Both files use the `ALTER TABLE` SQL command with the `RENAME COLUMN` clause to perform the column renaming operation.

## Dependencies
These migration scripts depend on a SQL-compatible database management system. While the specific system isn't explicitly stated, the syntax used is compatible with most major SQL databases such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQLite.

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration options in these migration scripts. However, the presence of both "up" and "down" migrations suggests that this project likely uses a database migration tool (such as Flyway, Liquibase, or a framework-specific migration system) to manage and apply these changes.

The filename `2024-01-09-235345_change_inv_field_name` likely follows a naming convention used by the migration tool, where:
- `2024-01-09-235345` is a timestamp indicating when the migration was created
- `change_inv_field_name` is a brief description of what the migration does

This naming convention helps to order migrations and provide a quick reference to their purpose.

It's important to note that while these scripts are simple, they can have significant implications for the application:

1. Data Integrity: The renaming operation preserves the data in the column, ensuring no information is lost during the migration.

2. Application Impact: Any part of the application that interacts with the `invitations` table will need to be updated to use the new column name after applying the "up" migration.

3. Reversibility: The inclusion of a "down" migration allows for easy rollback if issues arise after deployment.

4. Performance: While column renaming is typically a fast operation, it may briefly lock the table in some database systems, which could be a consideration for large tables or high-traffic applications.

Developers working with this codebase should be aware of these migrations and ensure that any related application code, queries, or views are updated accordingly when these migrations are applied or reverted.
