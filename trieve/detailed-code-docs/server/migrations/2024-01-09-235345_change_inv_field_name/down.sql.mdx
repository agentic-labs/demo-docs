## High-level description
This SQL migration script is designed to revert changes made to the `invitations` table. Specifically, it renames the column `organization_id` back to `dataset_id`.

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE invitations RENAME COLUMN organization_id TO dataset_id;
#### Description
This SQL statement modifies the structure of the `invitations` table by renaming a column.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| invitations | Table | The table being altered |
| organization_id | Column | The current name of the column to be renamed |
| dataset_id | Column | The new (reverted) name for the column |

#### Internal Logic
1. The statement targets the `invitations` table.
2. It identifies the column currently named `organization_id`.
3. It renames this column to `dataset_id`.

## Side Effects
- This migration will modify the schema of the `invitations` table.
- Any existing data in the `organization_id` column will be preserved but will now be accessible under the column name `dataset_id`.
- Any queries, views, or application code that references the `organization_id` column will need to be updated to use `dataset_id` instead.

## Dependencies
This script likely depends on a database management system that supports SQL, such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQLite.

## Configuration
No specific configuration options are present in this script.

## Error Handling
This script does not include explicit error handling. It relies on the database system's default error handling mechanisms.

## TODOs
The comment at the top of the file, `-- This file should undo anything in `up.sql``, suggests that this is a "down" migration script intended to revert changes made by a corresponding "up" migration. Developers should ensure that this script accurately undoes all changes made in the associated `up.sql` file.
