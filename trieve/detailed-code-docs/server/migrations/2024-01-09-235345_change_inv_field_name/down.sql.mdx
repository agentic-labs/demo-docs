## High-level description
This SQL migration script is designed to revert changes made to the `invitations` table. Specifically, it renames the column `organization_id` back to `dataset_id`.

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE invitations RENAME COLUMN organization_id TO dataset_id;
#### Description
This SQL statement modifies the structure of the `invitations` table by renaming a column.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| invitations | Table | The table being altered |
| organization_id | Column | The current name of the column to be renamed |
| dataset_id | Column | The new (reverted) name for the column |

#### Internal Logic
1. The statement targets the `invitations` table.
2. It identifies the column currently named `organization_id`.
3. It renames this column to `dataset_id`.

## Side Effects
- This migration will modify the schema of the `invitations` table.
- Any existing data in the `organization_id` column will be preserved but will now be accessed under the name `dataset_id`.
- This change may affect any queries, views, or application code that references the `invitations` table and expects an `organization_id` column.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| SQL Database System | To execute the ALTER TABLE statement |

## Notes
- This is a "down" migration script, meant to revert changes made by a corresponding "up" migration.
- The comment at the top of the file indicates that this script should undo anything done in the `up.sql` file.
- It's important to ensure that this down migration exactly reverses the changes made in the corresponding up migration to maintain database consistency.
- Care should be taken when applying this migration, as it could potentially break application functionality if the code hasn't been updated to use the new column name.
