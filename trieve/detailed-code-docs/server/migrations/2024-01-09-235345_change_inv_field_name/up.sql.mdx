## High-level description
This SQL migration script renames a column in the `invitations` table. Specifically, it changes the column name from `dataset_id` to `organization_id`.

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE invitations RENAME COLUMN dataset_id TO organization_id;
#### Description
This SQL statement modifies the structure of the `invitations` table by renaming an existing column.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `ALTER TABLE` command is used to modify the structure of the `invitations` table.
2. The `RENAME COLUMN` clause specifies that a column name is being changed.
3. The current column name `dataset_id` is being renamed to `organization_id`.

## Side Effects
- This migration will change the schema of the `invitations` table.
- Any existing queries or code that reference the `dataset_id` column in the `invitations` table will need to be updated to use `organization_id` instead.
- The data in the column remains unchanged; only the column name is affected.

## Performance Considerations
This operation is typically quick and does not involve data movement. However, the exact performance impact may depend on the database system and the size of the table. For large tables, it's recommended to perform this operation during low-traffic periods.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| SQL Database System | The database system must support the `ALTER TABLE` and `RENAME COLUMN` syntax as used in this script. |

## Error Handling
This script does not include explicit error handling. If the column rename operation fails (e.g., if the column doesn't exist or if there's a naming conflict), the database system will typically raise an error and roll back the transaction.

## TODOs
Consider adding a complementary down migration script to revert this change if needed.
