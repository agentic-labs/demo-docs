## High-level description
This SQL migration script renames a column in the `invitations` table. Specifically, it changes the column name from `dataset_id` to `organization_id`.

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE invitations RENAME COLUMN dataset_id TO organization_id;
#### Description
This SQL statement modifies the structure of the `invitations` table by renaming an existing column.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| invitations | table | The target table to be altered |
| dataset_id | column | The original name of the column to be renamed |
| organization_id | column | The new name for the column |

#### Internal Logic
1. The `ALTER TABLE` command is used to modify the structure of the `invitations` table.
2. The `RENAME COLUMN` clause specifies that a column is being renamed.
3. `dataset_id` is the current name of the column.
4. `TO organization_id` specifies the new name for the column.

## Side Effects
- This migration will change the schema of the `invitations` table.
- Any existing queries or code that reference the `dataset_id` column will need to be updated to use `organization_id` instead.
- The data within the column remains unchanged; only the column name is affected.

## Performance Considerations
This operation is typically fast and does not involve data movement. However, on large tables or in high-traffic databases, it may briefly lock the table during the rename operation.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| SQL database system | To execute the ALTER TABLE command |

Note: The specific SQL database system (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) is not explicitly stated in the file, but this SQL syntax is compatible with most major database systems.
