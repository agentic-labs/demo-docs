## High-level description
This SQL migration script removes a unique constraint named `uq_card_id` from the `card_verification` table. It's designed to be used as a "down" migration, reverting changes made in a corresponding "up" migration.

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE card_verification DROP CONSTRAINT uq_card_id;
#### Description
This SQL statement removes the unique constraint named `uq_card_id` from the `card_verification` table.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `ALTER TABLE` command is used to modify the structure of an existing table.
2. `card_verification` is the name of the table being altered.
3. `DROP CONSTRAINT` is used to remove a constraint from the table.
4. `uq_card_id` is the name of the unique constraint being removed.

## Side Effects
- Removing this constraint will allow duplicate values in the column(s) that were previously constrained by `uq_card_id`.
- This may affect data integrity if the application relies on the uniqueness of these values.
- It may also impact database performance, as unique constraints can be used for query optimization.

## Performance Considerations
Dropping a constraint is generally a quick operation, but it may briefly lock the table. The impact should be minimal unless the table is very large or under heavy use.
