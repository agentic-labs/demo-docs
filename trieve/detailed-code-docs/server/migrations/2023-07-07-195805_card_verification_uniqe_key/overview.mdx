## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for adding and removing a unique constraint on the `card_id` column in the `card_verification` table. The migration is dated 2023-07-07 and is identified by the timestamp 195805. The purpose of these scripts is to ensure data integrity by enforcing uniqueness of `card_id` values in the `card_verification` table.

## What does it do?
These migration scripts modify the structure of the `card_verification` table in the database. The "up" migration adds a unique constraint to the `card_id` column, ensuring that each card ID is only associated with one verification record. This prevents duplicate entries and maintains data consistency. The "down" migration removes this constraint, allowing for potential duplicate `card_id` values if needed.

## Key Files

1. `up.sql`:
   This file contains the SQL command to add the unique constraint. It uses the following command:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE card_verification ADD CONSTRAINT uq_card_id UNIQUE(card_id)
   ```
   This ensures that each `card_id` in the `card_verification` table is unique.

2. `down.sql`:
   This file contains the SQL command to remove the unique constraint. It uses the following command:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE card_verification DROP CONSTRAINT uq_card_id;
   ```
   This removes the uniqueness requirement for the `card_id` column.

## Side Effects
Adding the unique constraint (`up.sql`):
- Prevents insertion or update of duplicate `card_id` values in the `card_verification` table.
- May improve query performance for searches on the `card_id` column due to the creation of an index.
- Slightly increases the time for insert and update operations due to uniqueness checks.

Removing the unique constraint (`down.sql`):
- Allows duplicate `card_id` values in the `card_verification` table.
- May affect data integrity if the application relies on unique `card_id` values.
- Might impact database performance, as the index created by the unique constraint is removed.

## Performance Considerations
- Adding the constraint (`up.sql`) may briefly lock the table during execution.
- The constraint adds an index, potentially improving query performance for `card_id` lookups.
- Removing the constraint (`down.sql`) is generally a quick operation but may also briefly lock the table.
- The impact of these operations should be minimal unless the `card_verification` table is very large or under heavy use.

## Error Handling
These migration scripts do not include explicit error handling. If the `up.sql` migration fails (e.g., due to existing duplicate values), the database system will roll back the change and report an error. Similarly, if the `down.sql` migration encounters any issues, it will also be rolled back.

It's important to note that when applying the `up.sql` migration, existing data in the `card_verification` table must already satisfy the unique constraint for the migration to succeed. If there are duplicate `card_id` values in the table, the migration will fail.
