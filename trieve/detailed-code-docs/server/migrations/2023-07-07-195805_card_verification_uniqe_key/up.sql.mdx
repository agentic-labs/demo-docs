## High-level description
This SQL migration file adds a unique constraint to the `card_verification` table. Specifically, it ensures that the `card_id` column in the `card_verification` table contains only unique values.

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE card_verification ADD CONSTRAINT uq_card_id UNIQUE(card_id)
#### Description
This SQL statement alters the `card_verification` table by adding a unique constraint named `uq_card_id` on the `card_id` column.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `ALTER TABLE` command is used to modify the existing `card_verification` table.
2. `ADD CONSTRAINT` clause is used to add a new constraint to the table.
3. `uq_card_id` is the name given to this constraint, which can be used later if needed (e.g., for removing the constraint).
4. `UNIQUE(card_id)` specifies that the `card_id` column must contain only unique values across all rows in the table.

## Side Effects
- After this migration is applied, attempting to insert or update a row in the `card_verification` table with a `card_id` that already exists will result in a unique constraint violation error.
- This constraint may impact the performance of insert and update operations on the `card_verification` table, as the database will need to check for uniqueness.
- Existing data in the table must already satisfy this constraint for the migration to succeed. If there are duplicate `card_id` values in the table, the migration will fail.

## Performance Considerations
- Adding a unique constraint typically creates an index on the `card_id` column, which can improve query performance for searches on this column.
- However, insert and update operations may become slightly slower due to the uniqueness check.

## Error Handling
This migration does not include explicit error handling. If it fails (e.g., due to existing duplicate values), the database system will roll back the change and report an error.

Note: This is a "up" migration file, typically used in database migration systems to apply changes. There should be a corresponding "down" migration file to revert this change if needed.
