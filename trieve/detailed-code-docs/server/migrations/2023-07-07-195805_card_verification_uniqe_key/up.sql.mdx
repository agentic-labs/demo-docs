## High-level description
This SQL migration file adds a unique constraint to the `card_verification` table. Specifically, it ensures that the `card_id` column in the `card_verification` table contains only unique values.

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE card_verification ADD CONSTRAINT uq_card_id UNIQUE(card_id)
#### Description
This SQL statement alters the `card_verification` table by adding a unique constraint named `uq_card_id` on the `card_id` column.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `ALTER TABLE` command is used to modify an existing table structure.
2. `card_verification` is the name of the table being altered.
3. `ADD CONSTRAINT` clause is used to add a new constraint to the table.
4. `uq_card_id` is the name given to this unique constraint.
5. `UNIQUE(card_id)` specifies that the `card_id` column should contain only unique values.

## Side Effects
- After this migration is applied, the database will enforce uniqueness for the `card_id` column in the `card_verification` table.
- Any attempt to insert or update a row with a `card_id` value that already exists in the table will result in a constraint violation error.
- This constraint may impact the performance of insert and update operations on the `card_verification` table, as the database will need to check for uniqueness.

## Performance Considerations
- Adding a unique constraint typically creates an index on the `card_id` column, which can improve query performance for searches on this column.
- However, insert and update operations may become slightly slower due to the uniqueness check.

## Error Handling
While not explicitly defined in the migration, it's important to note that:
- If this migration is run on a table that already contains duplicate `card_id` values, it will fail.
- Applications interacting with this table need to handle potential uniqueness violation errors when inserting or updating records.
