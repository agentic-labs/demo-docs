## High-level description
This SQL script creates two tables, `organization_usage_counts` and `dataset_usage_counts`, to store usage statistics for organizations and datasets, respectively. It also defines several triggers and functions to automatically update these counts when related tables are modified.

## Code Structure
The code defines two tables (`organization_usage_counts` and `dataset_usage_counts`) and several functions (`update_chunk_metadata_counts`, `update_files_storage_counts`, `update_messages_counts`, `update_datasets_counts`, `update_users_counts`). Each function is associated with a trigger that executes the function when specific events (insert or delete) occur on related tables (`chunk_metadata`, `files`, `messages`, `datasets`, `user_organizations`).

## Symbols

### `organization_usage_counts` table
#### Description
This table stores aggregated usage counts for each organization.

#### Columns
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | UUID | Unique identifier for the record (primary key) |
| org_id | UUID | Unique identifier of the organization (foreign key to `organizations` table) |
| dataset_count | INTEGER | Number of datasets owned by the organization |
| user_count | INTEGER | Number of users belonging to the organization |
| file_storage | INTEGER | Total file storage used by the organization in bytes |
| message_count | INTEGER | Total number of messages associated with the organization's datasets |

### `dataset_usage_counts` table
#### Description
This table stores usage counts specific to each dataset.

#### Columns
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | UUID | Unique identifier for the record (primary key) |
| dataset_id | UUID | Unique identifier of the dataset (foreign key to `datasets` table) |
| chunk_count | INTEGER | Number of chunks within the dataset |

### `update_chunk_metadata_counts` function
#### Description
This function is triggered after an INSERT or DELETE operation on the `chunk_metadata` table. It updates the `chunk_count` in the `dataset_usage_counts` table based on the operation.

#### Inputs
This function implicitly receives the `NEW` and `OLD` records from the trigger.

#### Outputs
Returns `NULL`.

#### Internal Logic
- If the triggering event is `INSERT`, it tries to insert a new row into `dataset_usage_counts` with `chunk_count` as 1. If a row already exists for the `dataset_id`, it increments the existing `chunk_count` by 1.
- If the triggering event is `DELETE`, it decrements the `chunk_count` for the corresponding `dataset_id` in `dataset_usage_counts`. It ensures that `chunk_count` doesn't go below 0.

### `update_chunk_metadata_counts_trigger` trigger
#### Description
This trigger calls the `update_chunk_metadata_counts` function after each INSERT or DELETE operation on the `chunk_metadata` table.

### `update_files_storage_counts` function
#### Description
This function is triggered after an INSERT or DELETE operation on the `files` table. It updates the `file_storage` count in the `organization_usage_counts` table based on the operation.

#### Inputs
This function implicitly receives the `NEW` and `OLD` records from the trigger.

#### Outputs
Returns the `NEW` record.

#### Internal Logic
- If the triggering event is `INSERT`, it tries to insert a new row into `organization_usage_counts` with the `file_storage` equal to the size of the new file. If a row already exists for the organization, it adds the new file size to the existing `file_storage` value.
- If the triggering event is `DELETE`, it subtracts the deleted file size from the `file_storage` value for the corresponding organization in `organization_usage_counts`. It ensures that `file_storage` doesn't go below 0.

### `update_files_storage_trigger` trigger
#### Description
This trigger calls the `update_files_storage_counts` function after each INSERT or DELETE operation on the `files` table.

### `update_messages_counts` function
#### Description
This function is triggered after an INSERT or DELETE operation on the `messages` table. It updates the `message_count` in the `organization_usage_counts` table based on the operation.

#### Inputs
This function implicitly receives the `NEW` and `OLD` records from the trigger.

#### Outputs
Returns the `NEW` record.

#### Internal Logic
- If the triggering event is `INSERT`, it tries to insert a new row into `organization_usage_counts` with `message_count` as 1. If a row already exists for the organization, it increments the existing `message_count` by 1.
- If the triggering event is `DELETE`, it decrements the `message_count` for the corresponding organization in `organization_usage_counts`. It ensures that `message_count` doesn't go below 0.

### `update_messages_counts_trigger` trigger
#### Description
This trigger calls the `update_messages_counts` function after each INSERT or DELETE operation on the `messages` table.

### `update_datasets_counts` function
#### Description
This function is triggered after an INSERT or DELETE operation on the `datasets` table. It updates the `dataset_count` in the `organization_usage_counts` table based on the operation.

#### Inputs
This function implicitly receives the `NEW` and `OLD` records from the trigger.

#### Outputs
Returns the `NEW` record.

#### Internal Logic
- If the triggering event is `INSERT`, it tries to insert a new row into `organization_usage_counts` with `dataset_count` as 1. If a row already exists for the organization, it increments the existing `dataset_count` by 1.
- If the triggering event is `DELETE`, it decrements the `dataset_count` for the corresponding organization in `organization_usage_counts`. It ensures that `dataset_count` doesn't go below 0.

### `update_datasets_counts_trigger` trigger
#### Description
This trigger calls the `update_datasets_counts` function after each INSERT or DELETE operation on the `datasets` table.

### `update_users_counts` function
#### Description
This function is triggered after an INSERT or DELETE operation on the `user_organizations` table. It updates the `user_count` in the `organization_usage_counts` table based on the operation.

#### Inputs
This function implicitly receives the `NEW` and `OLD` records from the trigger.

#### Outputs
Returns the `NEW` record.

#### Internal Logic
- If the triggering event is `INSERT`, it tries to insert a new row into `organization_usage_counts` with `user_count` as 1. If a row already exists for the organization, it increments the existing `user_count` by 1.
- If the triggering event is `DELETE`, it decrements the `user_count` for the corresponding organization in `organization_usage_counts`. It ensures that `user_count` doesn't go below 0.

### `update_users_counts_trigger` trigger
#### Description
This trigger calls the `update_users_counts` function after each INSERT or DELETE operation on the `user_organizations` table.

## Side Effects
This script modifies the database schema by creating new tables and triggers. It also populates these tables with data based on the existing data in related tables.
