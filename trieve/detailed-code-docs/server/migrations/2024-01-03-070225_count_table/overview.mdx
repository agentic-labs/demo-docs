## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for implementing a usage counting system in a database. It includes two files: `up.sql` for creating the new structure and `down.sql` for reverting the changes. The migration introduces tables and triggers to track usage statistics for organizations and datasets, including counts for datasets, users, file storage, messages, and chunks.

## What does it do?
The migration scripts in this directory implement a system to automatically track and update usage statistics for organizations and datasets within the application. Here's a breakdown of what it accomplishes:

1. Creates two new tables:
   - `organization_usage_counts`: Stores aggregated usage data for each organization, including the number of datasets, users, total file storage, and message count.
   - `dataset_usage_counts`: Tracks the number of chunks for each dataset.

2. Implements several trigger functions that automatically update these counts when related actions occur:
   - When chunks are added or removed from a dataset
   - When files are uploaded or deleted, affecting storage usage
   - When messages are created or deleted
   - When datasets are created or removed
   - When users join or leave an organization

3. Sets up triggers on various tables (`chunk_metadata`, `files`, `messages`, `datasets`, `user_organizations`) to execute these functions automatically on insert or delete operations.

4. Provides a rollback mechanism (`down.sql`) that removes the new tables and triggers, reverting to a previous state where chunk metadata counts were tracked differently.

This system allows for real-time tracking of usage metrics without requiring manual updates, enabling efficient monitoring and potential usage-based billing or resource allocation.

## Key Files

1. `up.sql`:
   This file contains the SQL commands to set up the new usage counting system. It creates the `organization_usage_counts` and `dataset_usage_counts` tables, defines trigger functions for updating counts, and sets up triggers on relevant tables. This script is responsible for implementing the new feature.

   Key components:
   - Table creation for `organization_usage_counts` and `dataset_usage_counts`
   - Functions like `update_chunk_metadata_counts`, `update_files_storage_counts`, `update_messages_counts`, `update_datasets_counts`, and `update_users_counts`
   - Triggers that call these functions on insert or delete operations on related tables

2. `down.sql`:
   This file contains the SQL commands to revert the changes made by `up.sql`. It drops the newly created tables, triggers, and functions, and recreates a `chunk_metadata_counts` table with its associated trigger function. This script is used to roll back the migration if needed.

   Key components:
   - Dropping of triggers, functions, and tables created in `up.sql`
   - Recreation of `chunk_metadata_counts` table and its update function

These files work together to provide a complete migration path for implementing and potentially reverting the usage counting feature.

## Configuration
This migration does not rely on external configuration files or environment variables. All necessary settings and structures are defined within the SQL scripts themselves. However, it's important to note that the migration assumes the existence of certain tables in the database schema, such as `datasets`, `organizations`, `chunk_metadata`, `files`, `messages`, and `user_organizations`. The database administrator should ensure that these tables exist and have the expected structure before applying this migration.
