## High-level description
This SQL script reverts a migration that aimed to handle potential null values in chunk metadata counts. It drops triggers and a function related to updating chunk counts in the `dataset_usage_counts` table and recreates them with the previous logic.

## Code Structure
The code first drops existing triggers and a function, then recreates them with modified logic. The triggers `increase_chunk_metadata_counts_trigger` and `delete_chunk_metadata_counts_trigger` are defined on the `chunk_metadata` table and call the `update_chunk_metadata_counts` function.

## Symbols
### `DROP TRIGGER increase_chunk_metadata_counts_trigger ON chunk_metadata;`
#### Description
This statement drops the trigger named `increase_chunk_metadata_counts_trigger` on the `chunk_metadata` table. This trigger was presumably created in the `up.sql` migration script.

### `DROP TRIGGER delete_chunk_metadata_counts_trigger ON chunk_metadata;`
#### Description
Similar to the previous statement, this one drops the `delete_chunk_metadata_counts_trigger` from the `chunk_metadata` table.

### `DROP FUNCTION update_chunk_metadata_counts;`
#### Description
This statement drops the function named `update_chunk_metadata_counts`. This function was likely responsible for updating the `dataset_usage_counts` table based on changes in the `chunk_metadata` table.

### `CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_chunk_metadata_counts()`
#### Description
This statement recreates the `update_chunk_metadata_counts` function. This function is designed to be called by triggers on the `chunk_metadata` table. It updates the `chunk_count` in the `dataset_usage_counts` table based on whether a row is inserted into or deleted from the `chunk_metadata` table.

#### Inputs
This function implicitly takes the `NEW` and `OLD` records from the triggers as input.

#### Outputs
This function doesn't return any values directly (returns `NULL`). Its output is the side effect of updating the `dataset_usage_counts` table.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Retrieves dataset ID:** It fetches the `dataset_id` from the `modified` table (which represents either the `NEW` or `OLD` table based on the triggering event).
2. **Calculates new count:** It counts the number of records in the `modified` table.
3. **Handles INSERT event:** If the triggering event is an INSERT, it either inserts a new record into `dataset_usage_counts` with the calculated `new_count` or updates the existing record by adding the `new_count` to the current `chunk_count`.
4. **Handles DELETE event:** If the triggering event is a DELETE, it updates the corresponding record in `dataset_usage_counts` by subtracting the `new_count` from the current `chunk_count`.

### `CREATE TRIGGER increase_chunk_metadata_counts_trigger`
#### Description
This statement recreates the `increase_chunk_metadata_counts_trigger` trigger. This trigger is set to fire after an INSERT operation on the `chunk_metadata` table. It references the `NEW` table as `modified` and executes the `update_chunk_metadata_counts` function for each inserted row.

### `CREATE TRIGGER delete_chunk_metadata_counts_trigger`
#### Description
This statement recreates the `delete_chunk_metadata_counts_trigger` trigger. This trigger is set to fire after a DELETE operation on the `chunk_metadata` table. It references the `OLD` table as `modified` and executes the `update_chunk_metadata_counts` function for each deleted row.
