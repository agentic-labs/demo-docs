## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for adding scope limits to API keys in the database. The migration adds two new columns, `dataset_ids` and `organization_ids`, to the `user_api_key` table, allowing for more granular control over API key permissions.

## What does it do?
These migration scripts modify the database structure to enhance the functionality of API keys. They add the ability to associate specific datasets and organizations with each API key. This change allows for more fine-grained access control, where an API key can be limited to operate only on certain datasets or within specific organizations.

The migration consists of two parts:
1. An "up" script that adds the new columns to the table.
2. A "down" script that removes these columns, allowing for the changes to be reverted if necessary.

This approach enables developers to implement more sophisticated permission systems, where API keys can be scoped to particular resources, enhancing security and flexibility in API usage.

## Key Files

### up.sql
This file contains the SQL commands to add the new columns to the `user_api_key` table:

```sql
ALTER TABLE user_api_key ADD COLUMN dataset_ids TEXT[] DEFAULT NULL;
ALTER TABLE user_api_key ADD COLUMN organization_ids TEXT[] DEFAULT NULL;
```

These commands add two new columns, both of type `TEXT[]` (an array of text strings), with a default value of `NULL`. This allows each API key to be associated with multiple dataset IDs and organization IDs.

### down.sql
This file contains the SQL commands to remove the columns added by the up.sql script:

```sql
ALTER TABLE user_api_key DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS dataset_ids;
ALTER TABLE user_api_key DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS organization_ids;
```

These commands remove the `dataset_ids` and `organization_ids` columns from the `user_api_key` table if they exist. The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the script doesn't fail if the columns have already been removed.

## Configuration
The migration is identified by its timestamp: `2024-06-08-120012`. This timestamp is used to order migrations and ensure they are applied in the correct sequence.

No additional configuration is required for these SQL scripts. However, the application code that interacts with the `user_api_key` table will need to be updated to handle these new columns appropriately.

When using these new columns:
- `dataset_ids`: Should contain an array of dataset identifiers that the API key has access to.
- `organization_ids`: Should contain an array of organization identifiers that the API key has access to.

If either of these columns is `NULL`, it could be interpreted as the API key having unrestricted access to all datasets or organizations, respectively. The exact interpretation and implementation of these scope limits would be defined in the application logic.
