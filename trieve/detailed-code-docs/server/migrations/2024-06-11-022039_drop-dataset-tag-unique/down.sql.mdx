## High-level description
This SQL migration script reverts a change made in a previous migration, specifically the removal of a unique constraint on the `tag` column in the `dataset_tags` table. This indicates that the `tag` column should now allow duplicate values.

### `ALTER TABLE dataset_tags`
#### Description
This statement modifies the existing `dataset_tags` table.

#### Internal Logic
It adds a constraint named `dataset_tags_tag_key` to the table. This constraint enforces uniqueness on the `tag` column, meaning that no two rows can have the same value for the `tag` column. 

This effectively reverts the action likely performed in the corresponding `up.sql` migration file, where the unique constraint was probably dropped.
