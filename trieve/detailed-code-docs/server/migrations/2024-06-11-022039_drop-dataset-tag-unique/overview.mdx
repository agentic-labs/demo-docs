## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for modifying the `dataset_tags` table in a database. The migration's primary purpose is to remove a unique constraint on the `tag` column, allowing for duplicate tag entries for datasets.

## What does it do?
The migration scripts in this directory perform the following actions:

1. In the "up" migration (when applying the change):
   - It removes a unique constraint named `dataset_tags_tag_key` from the `dataset_tags` table.
   - This allows multiple rows in the table to have the same value in the `tag` column.

2. In the "down" migration (when reverting the change):
   - It adds back the unique constraint named `dataset_tags_tag_key` to the `dataset_tags` table.
   - This reinstates the rule that no two rows can have the same value in the `tag` column.

These changes affect how tags can be associated with datasets in the database. After applying the "up" migration, it becomes possible to have duplicate tags for a single dataset or across multiple datasets. This could be useful in scenarios where you want to allow multiple instances of the same tag, perhaps for different versions or contexts of a dataset.

## Key Files

1. `up.sql`:
   This file contains the SQL command to remove the unique constraint:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE dataset_tags
   DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS dataset_tags_tag_key;
   ```
   The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the migration doesn't fail if the constraint has already been removed, making the migration idempotent and safer to run multiple times.

2. `down.sql`:
   This file contains the SQL command to add back the unique constraint:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE dataset_tags
   ADD CONSTRAINT dataset_tags_tag_key UNIQUE (tag);
   ```
   This script is used to revert the changes made by the `up.sql` script, effectively undoing the migration if needed.

These files work together to provide a reversible database migration, allowing the development team to easily apply or roll back this specific change to the database schema.

## Configuration
The migration is identified by its timestamp-based directory name: `2024-06-11-022039_drop-dataset-tag-unique`. This naming convention is likely used by a database migration tool (such as Diesel for Rust or similar ORM tools) to track which migrations have been applied and in what order.

The timestamp `2024-06-11-022039` indicates that this migration was created on June 11, 2024, at 02:20:39 AM. The descriptive part of the name, `drop-dataset-tag-unique`, succinctly describes the purpose of the migration.

When running migrations, the database migration tool would typically:
1. Look for migrations that haven't been applied yet.
2. Run the `up.sql` scripts for those migrations in the order determined by their timestamps.
3. Record in a separate migrations table that these migrations have been applied.

If a rollback is needed, the tool would run the `down.sql` scripts in reverse order.

This configuration allows for version control of database schema changes, making it easier to manage database evolution over time and across different environments (development, staging, production, etc.).
