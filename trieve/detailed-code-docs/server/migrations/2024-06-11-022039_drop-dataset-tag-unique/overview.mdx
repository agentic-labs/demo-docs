## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for modifying the `dataset_tags` table in a database. The migration is specifically focused on dropping a unique constraint on the `tag` column of the `dataset_tags` table, allowing for potential duplicate tag entries.

## What does it do?
The migration scripts in this directory perform the following actions:

1. The "up" migration (in `up.sql`) removes a unique constraint named `dataset_tags_tag_key` from the `dataset_tags` table. This change allows multiple entries in the table to have the same tag value, which was previously prohibited.

2. The "down" migration (in `down.sql`) reverses this change by re-adding the unique constraint to the `tag` column of the `dataset_tags` table. This ensures that if the migration needs to be rolled back, the original data integrity rules are restored.

These changes likely reflect a design decision to allow datasets to have duplicate tags, which might be necessary for certain use cases or to resolve issues with the existing data model.

## Key Files

1. `up.sql`:
   This file contains the SQL command to drop the unique constraint:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE dataset_tags DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS dataset_tags_tag_key;
   ```
   The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the operation doesn't fail if the constraint has already been removed.

2. `down.sql`:
   This file contains the SQL command to re-add the unique constraint:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE dataset_tags ADD CONSTRAINT dataset_tags_tag_key UNIQUE(tag);
   ```
   This ensures that the `tag` column values are unique across all rows in the `dataset_tags` table.

## Configuration
The migration is identified by its timestamp: `2024-06-11-022039`. This timestamp is likely used by a database migration tool to track which migrations have been applied and in what order. The format suggests that this migration was created on June 11, 2024, at 02:20:39 AM.

No additional configuration files or environment variables are required for this migration. The SQL commands are self-contained and can be executed directly on the database.

It's important to note that while this migration allows for duplicate tags, the application logic may need to be updated to handle potential duplicate tags correctly. Additionally, any existing unique indexes or constraints on the `tag` column in other tables that reference `dataset_tags` may need to be reviewed and potentially modified to maintain data integrity.
