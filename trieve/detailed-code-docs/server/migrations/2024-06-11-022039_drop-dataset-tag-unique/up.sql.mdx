## High-level description
This SQL script defines a database migration that drops a unique constraint named `dataset_tags_tag_key` from the `dataset_tags` table. This action likely allows for duplicate tag entries within the table.

## Symbols

### `ALTER TABLE dataset_tags`
#### Description
This SQL statement modifies the existing `dataset_tags` table.

#### Internal Logic
It uses the `DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS` clause to remove the unique constraint named `dataset_tags_tag_key`. The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the operation doesn't fail if the constraint is already absent. 

### `dataset_tags`
#### Description
This refers to the name of the database table being modified. The table likely stores information about tags associated with datasets.

### `dataset_tags_tag_key`
#### Description
This is the name of the unique constraint being dropped from the `dataset_tags` table. This constraint likely enforced the uniqueness of a specific key column (possibly named `tag_key`) within the table.
