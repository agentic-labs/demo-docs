title: "down.sql"

## High-level description
This SQL script performs a database migration that reverts changes introduced in a previous migration, specifically related to automatic `updated_at` timestamp updates. It removes columns, functions, and triggers associated with this functionality.

## Symbols
### `down.sql`
#### Description
This SQL script undoes the changes made by the corresponding `up.sql` script, reverting the database to its state before the introduction of automatic `updated_at` timestamp updates.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Drop Columns:**
   - Removes the `created_at` and `updated_at` columns from the `card_verification` table.

2. **Drop Functions:**
   - Drops the `update_updated_at()` and `update_main_table_updated_at()` functions, which were likely responsible for updating the timestamps.

3. **Drop Triggers:**
   - Drops triggers named `update_updated_at` from various tables. These triggers were likely set up to automatically call the `update_updated_at()` function upon data modification.

#### Side Effects
- The database schema is modified by removing columns, functions, and triggers.
- Automatic updating of `updated_at` timestamps will no longer occur for the affected tables.
