## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for adding a new `weight` column to the `card_metadata` table in a database. The migration is dated 2023-12-19 and includes both "up" and "down" scripts for applying and reverting the change, respectively.

## What does it do?
These scripts modify the structure of a database table called `card_metadata`. The "up" script adds a new column called `weight` to this table. This column is designed to store a numerical value (specifically, a double-precision floating-point number) that likely represents some form of weighting or importance factor for each card. The column is set up so that it cannot be empty (NOT NULL) and will automatically be set to 1 if no other value is specified when a new card is added.

The "down" script does the opposite - it removes the `weight` column from the `card_metadata` table. This allows the database to be reverted to its previous state if needed.

These types of scripts are commonly used in database version control systems, allowing developers to track and manage changes to the database structure over time, and to easily apply or revert these changes as needed.

## Key Files

1. `up.sql`:
   This file contains the SQL command to add the `weight` column to the `card_metadata` table. Here's the command:

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE card_metadata ADD COLUMN weight double precision NOT NULL DEFAULT 1;
   ```

   This command does the following:
   - Alters the `card_metadata` table
   - Adds a new column named `weight`
   - Sets the data type to `double precision` (a floating-point number)
   - Makes the column `NOT NULL` (it must always have a value)
   - Sets a `DEFAULT` value of 1

2. `down.sql`:
   This file contains the SQL command to remove the `weight` column from the `card_metadata` table. Here's the command:

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE card_metadata DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS weight;
   ```

   This command does the following:
   - Alters the `card_metadata` table
   - Drops (removes) the `weight` column
   - Uses `IF EXISTS` to prevent errors if the column has already been removed

These files work together to provide a reversible change to the database schema. The `up.sql` file is used to apply the change (adding the column), while the `down.sql` file is used to revert the change (removing the column).

## Configuration
The migration is identified by its timestamp: `2023-12-19-213615`. This timestamp is likely used by a database migration tool to track which migrations have been applied and in what order. The format suggests that this migration was created on December 19, 2023, at 21:36:15 UTC.

No additional configuration appears to be required for these migration scripts. They are designed to be run directly against the database, likely through a migration tool that manages the execution and tracking of these scripts.
