## High-level description
This SQL migration file is designed to revert the changes made in the corresponding `up.sql` file. Specifically, it removes the `weight` column from the `card_metadata` table if it exists.

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE statement
#### Description
This SQL statement modifies the structure of the `card_metadata` table by removing the `weight` column.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `ALTER TABLE` command is used to modify the `card_metadata` table.
2. The `DROP COLUMN` clause is used to remove the `weight` column.
3. The `IF EXISTS` condition is added to prevent errors if the column doesn't exist.

## Side Effects
- This migration will modify the structure of the `card_metadata` table in the database.
- Any data stored in the `weight` column will be permanently deleted when this migration is applied.

## Error Handling
The `IF EXISTS` clause provides a basic form of error handling. If the `weight` column doesn't exist in the `card_metadata` table, the statement will not raise an error and will simply do nothing.

## TODOs
The comment at the top of the file suggests that this migration should undo anything done in the corresponding `up.sql` file. It's important to ensure that this down migration accurately reverses all changes made in the up migration.
