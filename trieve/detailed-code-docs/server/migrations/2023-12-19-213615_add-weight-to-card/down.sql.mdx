## Symbols

### `ALTER TABLE card_metadata DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS weight;`
#### Description
This SQL statement removes the `weight` column from the `card_metadata` table if it exists. The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the statement executes successfully even if the column has already been removed.

#### Internal Logic
- **`ALTER TABLE card_metadata`**: This part of the statement specifies that the `card_metadata` table is being modified.
- **`DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS weight`**: This part instructs the database to drop (remove) the column named `weight` if it exists in the table. 
    - `DROP COLUMN` is the command to remove a column.
    - `IF EXISTS` makes the operation conditional, preventing errors if the column is already absent.
    - `weight` is the name of the column to be removed.

#### Side Effects
This statement modifies the database schema by removing the `weight` column from the `card_metadata` table.
