## High-level description
This SQL migration file is designed to undo the changes made in the corresponding `up.sql` file. It removes three indexes that were previously created on the `created_at` columns of different tables in the database.

## Symbols

### `DROP INDEX chunk_metadata_created_at_idx;`
#### Description
This SQL command removes the index named `chunk_metadata_created_at_idx` from the database.

#### Internal Logic
The `DROP INDEX` statement is used to delete an existing index in a database. In this case, it's removing an index that was likely created on the `created_at` column of the `chunk_metadata` table.

### `DROP INDEX groups_created_at_idx;`
#### Description
This SQL command removes the index named `groups_created_at_idx` from the database.

#### Internal Logic
Similar to the previous command, this `DROP INDEX` statement deletes an index that was probably created on the `created_at` column of the `groups` table.

### `DROP INDEX files_created_at_idx;`
#### Description
This SQL command removes the index named `files_created_at_idx` from the database.

#### Internal Logic
This `DROP INDEX` statement removes an index that was likely created on the `created_at` column of the `files` table.

## Side Effects
The execution of this migration will result in the removal of three indexes from the database. This may impact query performance for operations that were previously utilizing these indexes, particularly for queries involving the `created_at` columns of the `chunk_metadata`, `groups`, and `files` tables.

## Performance Considerations
Removing indexes can have both positive and negative performance implications:

1. Positive: Faster write operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) on the affected tables, as the database no longer needs to update these indexes.
2. Negative: Potentially slower read operations that were previously benefiting from these indexes, especially queries filtering or sorting by the `created_at` column.

It's important to consider the trade-offs between read and write performance when deciding to remove these indexes.
