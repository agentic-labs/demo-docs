## High-level description
This SQL migration file adds three new indexes to improve query performance on the `created_at` columns of the `chunk_metadata`, `chunk_group`, and `files` tables. These indexes are designed to optimize queries that filter or sort by the creation timestamp of records in these tables.

## Symbols

### CREATE INDEX chunk_metadata_created_at_idx
#### Description
Creates an index named `chunk_metadata_created_at_idx` on the `created_at` column of the `chunk_metadata` table.

#### Internal Logic
The index is created on the `created_at` column, which likely contains timestamp data for when each chunk metadata record was created. This index will improve the performance of queries that filter, sort, or join on the `created_at` column of the `chunk_metadata` table.

### CREATE INDEX groups_created_at_idx
#### Description
Creates an index named `groups_created_at_idx` on the `created_at` column of the `chunk_group` table.

#### Internal Logic
This index is created on the `created_at` column of the `chunk_group` table. It will enhance the performance of queries that involve filtering, sorting, or joining on the creation timestamp of chunk groups.

### CREATE INDEX files_created_at_idx
#### Description
Creates an index named `files_created_at_idx` on the `created_at` column of the `files` table.

#### Internal Logic
This index is created on the `created_at` column of the `files` table. It will optimize queries that involve filtering, sorting, or joining based on the creation timestamp of file records.

## Performance Considerations
Adding these indexes will significantly improve the performance of queries that involve the `created_at` columns of the respective tables. However, it's important to note that while indexes speed up read operations, they can slightly slow down write operations (inserts, updates, and deletes) as the indexes need to be updated along with the table data. The trade-off is usually worthwhile for columns that are frequently used in WHERE clauses, ORDER BY statements, or JOIN conditions.

## Dependencies
This migration assumes the existence of the following tables:
1. `chunk_metadata`
2. `chunk_group`
3. `files`

Each of these tables must have a `created_at` column for the indexes to be created successfully.
