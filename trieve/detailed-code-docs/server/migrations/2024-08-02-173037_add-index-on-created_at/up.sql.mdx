## High-level description
This SQL script defines a database migration that adds indexes to the `created_at` columns of the `chunk_metadata`, `chunk_group`, and `files` tables. This is typically done to improve query performance for queries that filter or order by the `created_at` column.

## Symbols
### `CREATE INDEX chunk_metadata_created_at_idx ON chunk_metadata (created_at);`
#### Description
This statement creates an index named `chunk_metadata_created_at_idx` on the `created_at` column of the `chunk_metadata` table. 

#### Internal Logic
- `CREATE INDEX` is a SQL command used to create an index.
- `chunk_metadata_created_at_idx` is the name given to the new index.
- `ON chunk_metadata` specifies the table on which the index is created.
- `(created_at)` defines the column on which the index is created.

### `CREATE INDEX groups_created_at_idx ON chunk_group (created_at);`
#### Description

#### Internal Logic
- `CREATE INDEX` is a SQL command used to create an index.
- `groups_created_at_idx` is the name given to the new index.
- `ON chunk_group` specifies the table on which the index is created.
- `(created_at)` defines the column on which the index is created.

### `CREATE INDEX files_created_at_idx ON files (created_at);`
#### Description
This statement creates an index named `files_created_at_idx` on the `created_at` column of the `files` table. 

#### Internal Logic
- `CREATE INDEX` is a SQL command used to create an index.
- `files_created_at_idx` is the name given to the new index.
