## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for adding and removing indexes on the `created_at` columns of three tables: `chunk_metadata`, `chunk_group`, and `files`. The migration is dated 2024-08-02 and is likely part of a database schema version control system.

## What does it do?
These migration scripts modify the database structure to improve query performance for operations involving the `created_at` column in three specific tables. The "up" migration adds indexes to these columns, which can speed up searches, sorting, and filtering based on creation dates. The "down" migration removes these indexes, allowing the database to revert to its previous state if needed.

## Key Files
1. `up.sql`: This file contains SQL commands to create three new indexes:
   - `chunk_metadata_created_at_idx` on the `chunk_metadata` table
   - `groups_created_at_idx` on the `chunk_group` table
   - `files_created_at_idx` on the `files` table

   Each index is created on the `created_at` column of its respective table.

2. `down.sql`: This file contains SQL commands to drop the three indexes created by the `up.sql` script. It's used to revert the changes made by the migration.

## Configuration
The migration is identified by its timestamp: `2024-08-02-173037`. This naming convention is likely used by the migration system to track and apply changes in the correct order.

Here's an example of the SQL commands used in these files:

```sql
-- up.sql
CREATE INDEX chunk_metadata_created_at_idx ON chunk_metadata (created_at);
CREATE INDEX groups_created_at_idx ON chunk_group (created_at);
CREATE INDEX files_created_at_idx ON files (created_at);

-- down.sql
DROP INDEX chunk_metadata_created_at_idx;
DROP INDEX groups_created_at_idx;
DROP INDEX files_created_at_idx;
```

These migrations are designed to be reversible, allowing developers to apply or roll back changes to the database schema as needed during development or deployment processes.
