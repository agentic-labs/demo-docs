## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration files for adding and removing indexes on the `created_at` columns of three tables: `chunk_metadata`, `groups`, and `files`. The migration is dated 2024-08-02 and is designed to improve query performance for operations involving these tables' creation timestamps.

## What does it do?
The migration adds three new indexes to the database:

1. `chunk_metadata_created_at_idx` on the `chunk_metadata` table
2. `groups_created_at_idx` on the `groups` table (referred to as `chunk_group` in the up migration)
3. `files_created_at_idx` on the `files` table

These indexes are created to optimize queries that filter, sort, or join on the `created_at` columns of these tables. This can significantly improve the performance of read operations involving creation timestamps.

The migration also provides a way to undo these changes by removing the indexes if needed. This is important for maintaining database flexibility and allowing for rollbacks if issues arise.

## Key Files

### up.sql
This file contains the SQL commands to create the new indexes:

```sql
CREATE INDEX chunk_metadata_created_at_idx ON chunk_metadata (created_at);
CREATE INDEX groups_created_at_idx ON chunk_group (created_at);
CREATE INDEX files_created_at_idx ON files (created_at);
```

These commands add the indexes to their respective tables, which will improve query performance for operations involving the `created_at` columns.

### down.sql
This file contains the SQL commands to remove the indexes created by the up migration:

```sql
DROP INDEX chunk_metadata_created_at_idx;
DROP INDEX groups_created_at_idx;
DROP INDEX files_created_at_idx;
```

These commands allow for the removal of the indexes if needed, reverting the database to its previous state.

## Performance Considerations
Adding these indexes will have both positive and negative performance implications:

1. Positive impacts:
   - Faster read operations (SELECT queries) that involve filtering, sorting, or joining on the `created_at` columns of the affected tables.
   - Improved performance for queries that frequently access data based on creation timestamps.

2. Negative impacts:
   - Slightly slower write operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) on the affected tables, as the database needs to update these indexes along with the table data.
   - Increased storage space required to maintain the indexes.

The trade-off between improved read performance and slightly decreased write performance is usually beneficial for columns frequently used in WHERE clauses, ORDER BY statements, or JOIN conditions.

When removing the indexes (using down.sql), the performance implications will be reversed:
- Write operations may become faster.
- Read operations involving the `created_at` columns may become slower.

It's crucial to monitor database performance after applying this migration to ensure that the benefits outweigh any potential drawbacks in the specific use case of the application.

## Dependencies
This migration assumes the existence of three tables in the database:
1. `chunk_metadata`
2. `chunk_group` (referred to as `groups` in the down migration)
3. `files`

Each of these tables must have a `created_at` column for the indexes to be created successfully. The migration does not create these tables or columns; it only adds indexes to existing structures.
