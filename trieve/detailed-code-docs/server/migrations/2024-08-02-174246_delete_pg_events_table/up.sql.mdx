## High-level description
This SQL script defines the "up" migration for deleting the "events" table from a PostgreSQL database. This action is irreversible and will result in data loss.

## Symbols

### `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS events;`
#### Description
This SQL statement attempts to drop the table named "events" from the database. The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the statement executes without error even if the "events" table does not exist.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Check for Existence:** The database checks if a table named "events" exists.
2. **Drop if Exists:** If the "events" table exists, the database removes it and all its data. If the table does not exist, the statement completes without taking any action.

#### Side Effects
- **Data Loss:** This operation permanently deletes the "events" table and all associated data. This action is irreversible.
