## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for deleting the `events` table from a PostgreSQL database. It includes both "up" and "down" migration scripts, allowing for the removal of the table and its potential recreation if needed.

## What does it do?
The migration scripts in this directory perform the following actions:

1. The "up" migration (`up.sql`) removes the `events` table from the database. This action is irreversible and results in the loss of all data stored in the `events` table.

2. The "down" migration (`down.sql`) provides a way to recreate the `events` table if the migration needs to be rolled back. It recreates the table with its original structure, including all columns and constraints.

These migrations are typically part of a database schema management process, allowing developers to version control and manage changes to the database structure over time.

## Key Files

### up.sql
This file contains the SQL command to drop the `events` table:

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS events;
```

This command removes the `events` table if it exists. The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the operation doesn't fail if the table is already absent.

### down.sql
This file contains the SQL commands to recreate the `events` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE public.events (
    id uuid NOT NULL,
    created_at timestamp with time zone DEFAULT now() NOT NULL,
    updated_at timestamp with time zone DEFAULT now() NOT NULL,
    dataset_id uuid NOT NULL,
    event_type character varying(255) NOT NULL,
    event_data jsonb NOT NULL,
    CONSTRAINT file_upload_completed_notifications_pkey PRIMARY KEY (id),
    CONSTRAINT events_dataset_id_fkey FOREIGN KEY (dataset_id) REFERENCES public.datasets(id) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE
);
```

This command recreates the `events` table with the following structure:
- `id`: A UUID primary key
- `created_at` and `updated_at`: Timestamp fields with default values
- `dataset_id`: A UUID foreign key referencing the `datasets` table
- `event_type`: A varchar field for categorizing events
- `event_data`: A JSONB field for storing event-specific data

The table includes a foreign key constraint (`events_dataset_id_fkey`) that links each event to a dataset, with cascading delete and update actions.

## Configuration
This migration doesn't require any specific configuration. However, it's important to note that the execution of these migration scripts typically depends on the configuration of the database migration tool being used (e.g., Flyway, Liquibase, or a custom migration system).

## Dependencies
The migration scripts have an implicit dependency on the PostgreSQL database system, as they use PostgreSQL-specific features such as:
- The `uuid` data type
- The `jsonb` data type for storing JSON data
- The `timestamp with time zone` data type

Additionally, the `down.sql` script assumes the existence of a `public.datasets` table, as it references it in the foreign key constraint.

It's crucial to ensure that the PostgreSQL version used is compatible with these features and that the `datasets` table exists when running the down migration.
