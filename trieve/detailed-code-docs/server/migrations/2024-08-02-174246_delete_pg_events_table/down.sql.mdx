## High-level description
This SQL script defines the `down` migration for reverting changes introduced by a previous migration related to the `events` table. It aims to recreate the `events` table and its associated constraints in the `public` schema.

## Symbols

### `CREATE TABLE public.events`
#### Description
This statement recreates the `events` table in the `public` schema. The table is designed to store information about events related to datasets.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a SQL `CREATE TABLE` statement, it does not take explicit inputs.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a SQL `CREATE TABLE` statement, it does not return explicit outputs. It creates a table in the database.

#### Internal Logic
The statement defines the following columns for the `events` table:

*   `id`: A universally unique identifier (UUID) serving as the primary key.
*   `created_at`: A timestamp indicating the event creation time, defaulting to the current timestamp.
*   `updated_at`: A timestamp indicating the last event update time, defaulting to the current timestamp.
*   `dataset_id`: A foreign key referencing the `id` column of the `datasets` table, establishing a relationship between events and datasets.
*   `event_type`: A string (varchar) with a maximum length of 255 characters, specifying the type of event.
*   `event_data`: A JSONB column to store arbitrary event data.

The statement also defines the following constraints:

*   `file_upload_completed_notifications_pkey`: A primary key constraint on the `id` column, ensuring uniqueness.
*   `events_dataset_id_fkey`: A foreign key constraint on the `dataset_id` column, enforcing referential integrity with the `datasets` table. This constraint specifies cascading actions for delete and update operations on the referenced `datasets` table.

## References
- `public.datasets`: The script references the `datasets` table in the `public` schema when defining the foreign key constraint `events_dataset_id_fkey`. This suggests that the `events` table is related to the `datasets` table, and each event is associated with a specific dataset.
