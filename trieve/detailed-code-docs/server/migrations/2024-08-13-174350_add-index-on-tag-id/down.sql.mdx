## High-level description
This SQL script reverts the database migration defined in the corresponding `up.sql` file by dropping an index named `tag_id_idx`. This suggests that the `up.sql` file likely creates this index.

## Symbols

### `DROP INDEX IF EXISTS tag_id_idx;`
#### Description
This SQL statement attempts to drop an index named `tag_id_idx`. The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the statement executes successfully even if the index does not exist. This is a common practice in down migrations to handle cases where the database schema might be in a different state.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Check for Existence:** The database checks if an index with the name `tag_id_idx` exists.
2. **Conditional Drop:**
   - If the index exists, it is dropped from the database.
   - If the index does not exist, no action is taken.

#### Side Effects
- **Index Removal:** If the `tag_id_idx` index exists, it will be removed from the database. This might impact the performance of queries that previously utilized this index.
