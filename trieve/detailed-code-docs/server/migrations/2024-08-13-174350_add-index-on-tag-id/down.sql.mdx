## High-level description
This SQL script reverts the database migration defined in the corresponding `up.sql` file by dropping an index named `tag_id_idx`. This action is typically performed during database rollback operations.

## Symbols

### `DROP INDEX IF EXISTS tag_id_idx;`
#### Description
This SQL statement attempts to drop an index named `tag_id_idx` from the database. The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the statement executes successfully even if the index does not exist.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Check for Existence:** The database checks if an index named `tag_id_idx` exists.
2. **Conditional Drop:** 
    - If the index exists, the database drops it.
    - If the index does not exist, the statement completes without taking any action.
