## High-level description
This SQL script adds an index to the `chunk_metadata_tags` table on the `tag_id` column. This is intended to improve the performance of queries that filter or join on this column.

## Symbols

### `CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS tag_id_idx ON chunk_metadata_tags(tag_id)`
#### Description
This SQL statement creates an index named `tag_id_idx` on the `tag_id` column of the `chunk_metadata_tags` table if an index with that name doesn't already exist. 

#### Internal Logic
* `CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS`: This clause ensures that the index is created only if an index with the same name doesn't already exist. This prevents errors if the script is run multiple times.
* `tag_id_idx`: This is the name assigned to the new index.
* `chunk_metadata_tags`: This is the name of the table to which the index will be added.
* `(tag_id)`: This specifies that the index will be created on the `tag_id` column.

#### Side Effects
* **Improved query performance:** Queries that filter or join on the `tag_id` column are likely to be faster after the index is created.
* **Increased storage space:** Indexes require additional storage space.

#### Performance Considerations
Creating an index generally improves the speed of queries that use the indexed column in `WHERE` clauses, `JOIN` conditions, or similar operations. However, it also increases the storage space required for the table and can slightly slow down write operations (inserts, updates, deletes). Therefore, it's important to create indexes strategically, considering the trade-off between read and write performance and storage usage.
