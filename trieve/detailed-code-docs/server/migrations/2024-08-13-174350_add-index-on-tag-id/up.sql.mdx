## High-level description
This SQL migration script adds an index to the `chunk_metadata_tags` table on the `tag_id` column. This is intended to improve the performance of queries that filter or search by tag ID. 

## Symbols

### `CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS tag_id_idx ON chunk_metadata_tags(tag_id)`
#### Description
This SQL statement creates an index named `tag_id_idx` on the `tag_id` column of the `chunk_metadata_tags` table if it doesn't already exist. 

#### Internal Logic
* `CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS`: This clause ensures that the index is created only if an index with the same name doesn't already exist. This prevents errors if the migration is run multiple times.
* `tag_id_idx`: This is the name assigned to the new index.
* `chunk_metadata_tags`: This is the table on which the index is being created.
* `(tag_id)`: This specifies that the index is created on the `tag_id` column.

#### Side Effects
* **Improved query performance:** Queries that filter or search by `tag_id` will be faster as the database can use the index to quickly locate the relevant rows.
* **Increased storage space:** Indexes require additional storage space. The size of the index will depend on the size of the table and the data type of the indexed column.

#### Performance Considerations
Creating an index can improve query performance but may slightly slow down write operations (inserts, updates, deletes) on the table. This is because the database needs to update the index whenever data in the indexed column changes.
