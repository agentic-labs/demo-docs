## High-level description

## Symbols

### `CREATE TABLE topics`
#### Description
This SQL statement defines a new table named `topics` with its corresponding columns and constraints.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a SQL statement, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This statement creates a table in the database as a side effect.

#### Internal Logic
- **`id UUID NOT NULL UNIQUE PRIMARY KEY`**: Defines the `id` column as a universally unique identifier (UUID) that cannot be null and serves as the primary key for the table.
- **`user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id)`**: Defines the `user_id` column as a UUID that cannot be null and creates a foreign key constraint referencing the `id` column of the `users` table.
- **`resolution TEXT NOT NULL`**: Defines the `resolution` column as a text field that cannot be null, intended to store the debate topic's resolution statement.
- **`side BOOLEAN NOT NULL`**: Defines the `side` column as a boolean value that cannot be null, likely representing the "for" or "against" stance on the resolution.
- **`deleted BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE`**: Defines the `deleted` column as a boolean value that cannot be null, defaults to `FALSE`, and indicates whether the topic has been marked as deleted.
- **`created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL`**: Defines the `created_at` column as a timestamp value that cannot be null, recording when the topic was created.
- **`updated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL`**: Defines the `updated_at` column as a timestamp value that cannot be null, recording when the topic was last updated.

## Side Effects
- Creates the `topics` table in the database.
- Establishes a foreign key relationship between the `topics` table and the `users` table.
