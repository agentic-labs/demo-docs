## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for creating and dropping a `topics` table in a database. The migration is dated 2023-04-20 and is identified by the timestamp 160046. The directory includes two SQL files: `up.sql` for creating the table and `down.sql` for dropping it.

## What does it do?
These migration scripts manage the lifecycle of a `topics` table in the database:

1. The `up.sql` script creates a new `topics` table. This table is designed to store information about debate topics, including:
   - A unique identifier for each topic
   - The user who created the topic
   - The resolution or statement of the debate topic
   - The side or stance on the topic (represented as a boolean)
   - A flag to mark if the topic has been deleted
   - Timestamps for creation and last update

2. The `down.sql` script provides a way to revert the changes made by `up.sql`. It drops the `topics` table if it exists, effectively removing all topic data from the database.

These scripts allow developers to easily set up or tear down the `topics` table structure in different environments or when updating the application.

## Key Files

### up.sql
This file contains the SQL commands to create the `topics` table. Here's a breakdown of the table structure:

```sql
CREATE TABLE topics (
    id UUID NOT NULL UNIQUE PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),
    resolution TEXT NOT NULL,
    side BOOLEAN NOT NULL,
    deleted BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL
);
```

- `id`: A unique identifier for each topic, using UUID format.
- `user_id`: Links to the user who created the topic, referencing the `users` table.
- `resolution`: The actual text of the debate topic.
- `side`: A boolean representing the stance on the topic (possibly true for "for" and false for "against").
- `deleted`: A flag to mark if the topic has been soft-deleted.
- `created_at` and `updated_at`: Timestamps for tracking when the topic was created and last updated.

### down.sql
This file contains a single SQL command to drop the `topics` table:

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS topics;
```

This command will remove the `topics` table and all its data if it exists in the database.

## Configuration
These migration scripts don't require any additional configuration. They are designed to be run as part of a database migration process, typically managed by an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool or a custom migration system.

The naming convention of the directory (2023-04-20-160046_create_topics) suggests that these migrations are part of a versioned migration system, where the timestamp in the directory name determines the order in which migrations are applied or rolled back.

## Dependencies
While not explicitly stated in the provided files, these SQL scripts imply the following dependencies:

1. A relational database system that supports SQL, likely PostgreSQL given the use of UUID data type.
2. An existing `users` table in the database, as the `topics` table references it with a foreign key constraint.
3. A migration management system that can execute these SQL scripts in the appropriate order and track which migrations have been applied.

It's important to note that the successful execution of these scripts depends on the database having the necessary permissions to create and drop tables, as well as the existence of the referenced `users` table.
