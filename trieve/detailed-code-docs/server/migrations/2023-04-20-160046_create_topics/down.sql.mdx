## High-level description
This SQL script handles the rollback of a database migration. Specifically, it drops the `topics` table if it exists. This action is typically performed when uninstalling or reverting a software update.

## Symbols

### `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS topics;`
#### Description
This SQL statement attempts to drop the table named `topics` only if it exists in the database. 

#### Internal Logic
- **`DROP TABLE`**: This is a SQL command used to delete a table from the database.
- **`IF EXISTS`**: This clause modifies the `DROP TABLE` command to only execute if the specified table (`topics` in this case) already exists. This prevents errors if the table does not exist.
- **`topics`**: This is the name of the table to be dropped.

#### Side Effects
- **Data Loss**: If the `topics` table exists, this statement will permanently delete the table and all its data.
