## High-level description
This SQL script handles the rollback of a database migration. Specifically, it drops the `topics` table if it exists. This action is typically performed when uninstalling or reverting a software update.

## Symbols

### `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS topics;`
#### Description
This SQL statement attempts to drop the table named `topics`. The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the statement executes successfully even if the `topics` table doesn't exist. This prevents errors during rollback if the table was not created in the first place.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Check for Existence:** The database checks if a table named `topics` exists.
2. **Conditional Drop:**
   - If the `topics` table exists, the database drops it, removing the table and all its data.
   - If the `topics` table doesn't exist, the statement completes without taking any action.
