## High-level description
This SQL script adds a new column named `size` to the `files` table in a database. The column is intended to store file size information and is set to be non-nullable with a default value of 0.

## Symbols

### `ALTER TABLE files ADD COLUMN size bigint NOT NULL DEFAULT 0;`
#### Description
This SQL statement modifies the existing `files` table by adding a new column named `size`.

#### Internal Logic
- **`ALTER TABLE files`**: This clause initiates the modification of the `files` table.
- **`ADD COLUMN size`**: This clause specifies that a new column named `size` is being added.
- **`bigint`**: This defines the data type of the new column as a large integer, suitable for storing file sizes.
- **`NOT NULL`**: This constraint ensures that the `size` column cannot be left empty for any record in the `files` table.
- **`DEFAULT 0`**: This sets a default value of 0 for the `size` column for any new records inserted into the `files` table. This is useful to maintain data consistency if the file size is not immediately available during insertion.
