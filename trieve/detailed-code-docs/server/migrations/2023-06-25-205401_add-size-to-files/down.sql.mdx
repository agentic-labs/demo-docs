## High-level description
This SQL migration file is designed to revert the changes made in the corresponding `up.sql` file. It removes the `size` column from the `files` table in the database.

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE Statement
#### Description
This SQL statement modifies the structure of the `files` table by removing a column.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `ALTER TABLE` command is used to modify the `files` table.
2. The `DROP COLUMN` clause is used to remove the `size` column from the table.

## Side Effects
Executing this migration will permanently remove the `size` column and all its data from the `files` table. This operation cannot be undone without restoring from a backup or re-running the corresponding `up` migration.

## Dependencies
This migration assumes the existence of:
1. A database with a `files` table
2. A `size` column in the `files` table

## Error Handling
No explicit error handling is implemented in this migration. If the `size` column doesn't exist or if there are any dependencies on this column, the database system will likely raise an error when executing this migration.

## TODOs
The comment at the top of the file suggests that this migration should undo anything done in the corresponding `up.sql` file. It's important to ensure that this `down.sql` file correctly reverses all changes made in the `up.sql` file to maintain database consistency during migrations.
