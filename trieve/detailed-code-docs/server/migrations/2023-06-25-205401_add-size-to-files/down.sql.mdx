## High-level description
This SQL script defines a database migration that reverts a change made to the `files` table. Specifically, it removes the `size` column. This script is intended to be run as part of a database migration rollback.

## Symbols

### `ALTER TABLE files DROP COLUMN size;`
#### Description
This SQL statement removes the `size` column from the `files` table.

#### Internal Logic
This statement uses the `ALTER TABLE` command to modify the structure of the `files` table. The `DROP COLUMN` clause specifies that the `size` column should be removed. 

#### Side Effects
This statement directly modifies the database schema by removing the `size` column from the `files` table. Any data previously stored in this column will be permanently deleted.
