## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for adding a new `size` column to the `files` table in a database. The migration is dated 2023-06-25 and is identified by the timestamp 205401. The directory includes two SQL files: `up.sql` for applying the migration and `down.sql` for reverting it.

## What does it do?
This migration modifies the structure of the `files` table in the database. It adds a new column called `size` to store information about the size of files. When applied, it allows the database to track the size of each file entry. If needed, the migration can be rolled back, removing the `size` column and reverting the table to its previous state.

The workflow is as follows:
1. When upgrading the database (applying the migration):
   - A new `size` column is added to the `files` table.
   - This column is set to store large integer values (bigint).
   - It is configured as non-nullable, meaning every file entry must have a size.
   - A default value of 0 is set for this column.

2. When downgrading the database (reverting the migration):
   - The `size` column is removed from the `files` table.
   - Any data stored in this column is permanently deleted.

## Key Files

1. `up.sql`:
   - This file contains the SQL command to add the `size` column to the `files` table.
   - The command used is:
     ```sql
     ALTER TABLE files ADD COLUMN size bigint NOT NULL DEFAULT 0;
     ```
   - This ensures that the `size` column is added with the correct data type (bigint), is non-nullable, and has a default value of 0.

2. `down.sql`:
   - This file contains the SQL command to remove the `size` column from the `files` table.
   - The command used is:
     ```sql
     ALTER TABLE files DROP COLUMN size;
     ```
   - This command will revert the changes made by the `up.sql` script, removing the `size` column and any data it contained.

These files work together to provide a reversible database migration. The `up.sql` script is used when upgrading the database schema, while the `down.sql` script is used if the migration needs to be rolled back.

## Configuration
This migration does not require any specific configuration files or environment variables. However, it's important to note that the migration system (likely using a tool like Diesel or another ORM) will need to be properly configured to find and execute these migration scripts.

The naming convention of the directory (YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS_description) is likely part of the configuration of the migration system, allowing it to track and apply migrations in the correct order.

When applying this migration, database administrators or developers should be aware that:
1. The `files` table must exist in the database before this migration can be applied.
2. Adding a non-nullable column with a default value to an existing table with data is generally a safe operation and should not cause data loss.
3. However, rolling back this migration (using `down.sql`) will result in the permanent deletion of any data stored in the `size` column.

It's recommended to backup the database before applying or rolling back this migration, especially in a production environment.
