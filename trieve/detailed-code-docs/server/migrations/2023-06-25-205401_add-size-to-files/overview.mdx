## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration files for adding a `size` column to the `files` table in the database. It consists of two files: `up.sql` for applying the change, and `down.sql` for reverting it. These migrations are part of a database schema version control system, allowing for structured and reversible changes to the database schema.

## What does it do?
The migration in this directory modifies the structure of the `files` table in the database. Specifically:

1. The `up.sql` file adds a new column called `size` to the `files` table. This column is designed to store the size of files, likely in bytes, as a non-nullable `bigint` with a default value of 0.

2. The `down.sql` file provides the reverse operation, removing the `size` column from the `files` table. This allows the change to be undone if necessary.

These migrations enable the application to store and manage file size information within the database, which could be useful for various purposes such as storage management, reporting, or user quotas.

## Key Files

1. `up.sql`:
   This file contains the SQL command to add the `size` column to the `files` table. Here's the content:

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE files
   ADD COLUMN size bigint NOT NULL DEFAULT 0;
   ```

   This command modifies the `files` table by adding a new `size` column of type `bigint`. The column is set to be non-nullable (`NOT NULL`) and has a default value of 0.

2. `down.sql`:
   This file contains the SQL command to remove the `size` column from the `files` table. Here's the content:

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE files
   DROP COLUMN size;
   ```

   This command removes the `size` column from the `files` table, effectively undoing the change made by the `up.sql` file.

## Side Effects
Executing these migrations will have the following effects:

- Running `up.sql`:
  - Modifies the schema of the `files` table in the database.
  - Adds a new `size` column to all existing rows in the `files` table, with a default value of 0.
  - Future insertions into the `files` table will require a value for the `size` column (or will use the default value of 0 if not specified).

- Running `down.sql`:
  - Removes the `size` column and all its data from the `files` table.
  - This operation cannot be undone without restoring from a backup or re-running the `up` migration.

## Performance Considerations
- Adding a column to an existing table with a default value (as in `up.sql`) is generally a fast operation in most database systems, as it doesn't require updating existing rows.
- However, if the `files` table contains a large number of rows, this operation might take some time to complete, depending on the database system and hardware.
- Removing a column (as in `down.sql`) can also be a relatively quick operation, but again, the duration may depend on the size of the table and the database system being used.

## Dependencies
These migrations assume the existence of:
1. A database with a `files` table
2. A database management system that supports `ALTER TABLE` operations for adding and dropping columns

## Error Handling
No explicit error handling is implemented in these migration files. If there are any issues (e.g., the `files` table doesn't exist, or there are dependencies on the `size` column when trying to remove it), the database system will likely raise an error when executing the migration.

## Notes
- The use of `bigint` for the `size` column allows for storing very large file sizes (up to 8 bytes or 64 bits), suitable for files up to approximately 8 exabytes in size.
- The timestamp in the directory name (2023-06-25-205401) indicates when this migration was created and helps maintain the order of migrations.
- It's crucial to ensure that the `down.sql` file correctly reverses all changes made in the `up.sql` file to maintain database consistency during migrations.
