title: "down.sql"
---

## High-level description
This SQL script defines a database migration that reverts changes made to the `users` table, specifically the removal of the `username`, `visible_email`, and `website` columns. This suggests that a previous migration (likely in an `up.sql` file) removed these columns, and this "down" migration is designed to undo that change.

## Symbols

### `ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN username TEXT;`
#### Description
This statement adds a column named `username` to the `users` table. The data type of the column is `TEXT`, which can store long strings.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a SQL statement, not a function with inputs.

#### Outputs
N/A - This statement modifies the database schema and doesn't return a value.

#### Internal Logic
This statement uses the `ALTER TABLE` command to modify the existing `users` table. `ADD COLUMN` is used to append a new column with the specified name and data type.

### `ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN visible_email BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE;`
#### Description
This statement adds a column named `visible_email` to the `users` table. The data type is `BOOLEAN`, indicating it stores true/false values. The `NOT NULL` constraint ensures that every row must have a value for this column. `DEFAULT FALSE` sets the default value of the column to `FALSE` for new rows if no value is explicitly provided.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a SQL statement, not a function with inputs.

#### Outputs
N/A - This statement modifies the database schema and doesn't return a value.

#### Internal Logic
Similar to the previous statement, this uses `ALTER TABLE` and `ADD COLUMN`. It additionally defines constraints for the column: `NOT NULL` and `DEFAULT FALSE`.

### `ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN website TEXT;`
#### Description
This statement adds a column named `website` to the `users` table with a data type of `TEXT`, allowing it to store website URLs as strings.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a SQL statement, not a function with inputs.

#### Outputs
N/A - This statement modifies the database schema and doesn't return a value.

#### Internal Logic
This statement uses the same `ALTER TABLE` and `ADD COLUMN` commands to add a new column to the `users` table.
