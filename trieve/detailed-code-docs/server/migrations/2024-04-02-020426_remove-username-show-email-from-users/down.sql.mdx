### `down.sql`
#### Description
This SQL script is executed when rolling back a database migration. It adds three columns back to the `users` table: `username`, `visible_email`, and `website`.

#### Internal Logic
1. **`ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN username TEXT;`**: This statement adds a new column named `username` to the `users` table. The data type of the column is `TEXT`, allowing for variable-length strings.

2. **`ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN visible_email BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE;`**: This statement adds a new column named `visible_email` to the `users` table. The data type is `BOOLEAN`, representing true/false values. It's set to `NOT NULL`, meaning it cannot be empty, and has a default value of `FALSE`.

3. **`ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN website TEXT;`**: This statement adds a new column named `website` to the `users` table. The data type is `TEXT`, allowing for variable-length strings to store website URLs.
