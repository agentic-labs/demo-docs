## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for modifying the `users` table in a database. The migration removes three columns: `username`, `visible_email`, and `website`. The directory includes both "up" and "down" migration scripts, allowing for the changes to be applied or rolled back as needed.

## What does it do?
These migration scripts make changes to the structure of the `users` table in the database. The "up" migration removes three columns that were previously used to store additional user information:

1. `username`: Likely used to store a user's chosen display name.
2. `visible_email`: A boolean flag probably used to control whether a user's email address should be publicly visible.
3. `website`: Presumably used to store a URL for the user's personal website.

By removing these columns, the application is simplifying its user data model. This could be due to changes in application requirements, privacy considerations, or a shift in how user information is managed.

The "down" migration does the opposite, adding these columns back to the table. This allows the changes to be reversed if needed, providing flexibility in database management.

## Key Files

### up.sql
This file contains the SQL commands to apply the migration:

```sql
ALTER TABLE users DROP COLUMN username;
ALTER TABLE users DROP COLUMN visible_email;
ALTER TABLE users DROP COLUMN website;
```

Each line removes one of the specified columns from the `users` table. When this script is executed, it will modify the table structure, permanently deleting any data stored in these columns.

### down.sql
This file contains the SQL commands to reverse the migration:

```sql
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN username TEXT;
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN visible_email BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE;
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN website TEXT;
```

These commands add back the columns that were removed in the "up" migration. Note that:
- `username` and `website` are added as `TEXT` columns, allowing for variable-length strings.
- `visible_email` is added as a `BOOLEAN` column with a `NOT NULL` constraint and a default value of `FALSE`.

## Configuration
The migration is identified by its timestamp: `2024-04-02-020426`. This timestamp is likely used by the migration system to track which migrations have been applied and in what order.

No additional configuration appears to be required for these migration scripts. They are straightforward SQL commands that directly modify the database schema.

## Dependencies
These migration scripts don't explicitly depend on any external libraries or frameworks. However, they do assume:

1. The existence of a `users` table in the database.
2. A database system that supports standard SQL `ALTER TABLE` commands.
3. A migration system capable of executing these "up" and "down" scripts and tracking their application.

The exact database system isn't specified, but these commands should work with most relational database management systems (RDBMS) such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQLite.

In conclusion, this migration represents a significant change to the user data model, removing fields that were previously used to store additional user information. When applying this migration, developers should be aware that it will result in the permanent deletion of data in the removed columns. Care should be taken to ensure that this data is no longer needed or has been migrated elsewhere before applying these changes.
