## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for adding a new table called `verification_notifications` to the database. The migration is dated 2023-07-07 and includes both 'up' and 'down' scripts for applying and rolling back the changes respectively.

## What does it do?
The migration scripts in this directory perform the following actions:

1. The 'up' script creates a new table called `verification_notifications` in the database. This table is designed to store information about notifications related to card verification processes. It includes fields for identifying the user, the card, and the specific verification attempt associated with each notification. It also stores a similarity score, a flag indicating whether the user has read the notification, and timestamps for creation and last update.

2. The 'down' script provides a way to reverse this change by dropping the `verification_notifications` table if it exists. This allows for easy rollback of the migration if needed.

These scripts enable the application to track and manage notifications related to card verification processes, linking them to specific users, cards, and verification attempts. This could be used, for example, to notify users about the status or results of card verification processes.

## Key Files

1. `up.sql`: This file contains the SQL script to create the `verification_notifications` table. It defines the structure of the table including all its columns, data types, constraints, and default values. It also establishes foreign key relationships with other tables in the database.

2. `down.sql`: This file contains the SQL script to drop the `verification_notifications` table. It's designed to be idempotent, meaning it can be run multiple times without causing errors, even if the table doesn't exist.

## Dependencies
The migration scripts are written in PostgreSQL dialect and depend on a PostgreSQL database to execute. They also assume the existence of other tables in the database:

- `users`: Referenced by the `user_uuid` column
- `card_metadata`: Referenced by the `card_uuid` column
- `card_verification`: Referenced by the `verification_uuid` column

## Configuration
These migration scripts don't require any specific configuration. However, they should be run using a database migration tool that can handle 'up' and 'down' migrations. The tool should be configured to connect to the appropriate PostgreSQL database where these changes need to be applied.

Here's a detailed look at the structure of the `verification_notifications` table being created:

```sql
CREATE TABLE verification_notifications (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    user_uuid UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),
    card_uuid UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES card_metadata(id),
    verification_uuid UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES card_verification(id),
    similarity_score BIGINT NOT NULL,
    user_read BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false,
    created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);
```

This table structure allows for efficient tracking and querying of verification notifications, with each notification linked to a specific user, card, and verification attempt. The `similarity_score` field could be used to store a metric related to the verification process, while the `user_read` flag allows for tracking whether a user has seen or acknowledged a notification. The `created_at` and `updated_at` timestamps provide audit trail capabilities for each notification entry.
