## High-level description
This SQL script handles the database migration rollback for removing the `verification_notifications` table. It's intended to be idempotent, meaning it can be safely executed multiple times without causing issues.

## Symbols

### `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS verification_notifications;`
#### Description
This SQL statement attempts to drop the `verification_notifications` table if it exists. The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the statement won't raise an error if the table doesn't exist, making the script idempotent.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Check for existence:** The database checks if a table named `verification_notifications` exists.
2. **Conditional drop:**
   - If the table exists, it's dropped from the database.
   - If the table doesn't exist, no action is taken.

#### Side Effects
- **Data loss:** If the `verification_notifications` table exists, this statement will permanently delete the table and all its data.
