## High-level description

## Symbols

### `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS verification_notifications;`
#### Description
This SQL statement attempts to drop the `verification_notifications` table from the database. The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the operation doesn't fail if the table doesn't exist.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Check for Existence:** The database checks if a table named `verification_notifications` exists.
2. **Drop Table (If Exists):** If the table exists, it's permanently removed from the database along with all its data. If the table doesn't exist, the statement completes without any action.
