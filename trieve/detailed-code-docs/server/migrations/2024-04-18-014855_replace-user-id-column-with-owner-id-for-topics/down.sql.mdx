## High-level description
This SQL script defines a database migration that reverts the changes introduced by the corresponding `up.sql` migration. Specifically, it aims to undo the replacement of the `user_id` column with the `owner_id` column in the `topics` table.

### `down.sql`
#### Description
This SQL script contains a series of commands to revert the changes made by the `up.sql` migration. It restores the `user_id` column, populates it with data from the `owner_id` column, drops the `owner_id` column, and removes the index associated with it.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Add `user_id` column:**
   - `ALTER TABLE topics ADD COLUMN user_id TEXT;` adds a new column named `user_id` to the `topics` table with the data type `TEXT`.

2. **Populate `user_id` from `owner_id`:**
   - `UPDATE topics SET user_id = owner_id;` copies the values from the `owner_id` column to the newly added `user_id` column.

3. **Drop `owner_id` column:**
   - `ALTER TABLE topics DROP COLUMN owner_id;` removes the `owner_id` column from the `topics` table.

4. **Drop index:**
   - `DROP INDEX IF EXISTS "topics_dataset_id_owner_id_idx";` removes the index named `"topics_dataset_id_owner_id_idx"` if it exists. This index was likely created in the `up.sql` migration and is no longer needed after dropping the `owner_id` column.
