## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for replacing the `user_id` column with an `owner_id` column in the `topics` table of a database. The migration is designed to be reversible, with separate scripts for applying the changes (`up.sql`) and reverting them (`down.sql`).

## What does it do?
The migration performs the following tasks:

1. In the "up" direction:
   - Adds a new `owner_id` column to the `topics` table.
   - Copies existing `user_id` values to the new `owner_id` column.
   - Removes the old `user_id` column.
   - Creates an index on `dataset_id` and `owner_id` for improved query performance.

2. In the "down" direction:
   - Adds back the `user_id` column to the `topics` table.
   - Copies `owner_id` values to the `user_id` column.
   - Removes the `owner_id` column.
   - Drops the index created in the "up" migration.

This migration allows the database schema to transition from using `user_id` to `owner_id` for the `topics` table, which might be part of a larger refactoring effort or a change in the application's data model.

## Key Files

### up.sql
This file contains the SQL commands to apply the migration:

```sql
ALTER TABLE topics ADD COLUMN owner_id TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000';
UPDATE topics SET owner_id = user_id WHERE user_id IS NOT NULL;
ALTER TABLE topics DROP COLUMN user_id;
CREATE INDEX "topics_dataset_id_owner_id_idx" ON topics (dataset_id, owner_id);
```

The script adds the `owner_id` column, populates it with existing `user_id` values, drops the `user_id` column, and creates an index for improved query performance.

### down.sql
This file contains the SQL commands to revert the migration:

```sql
ALTER TABLE topics ADD COLUMN user_id TEXT;
UPDATE topics SET user_id = owner_id;
ALTER TABLE topics DROP COLUMN owner_id;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS "topics_dataset_id_owner_id_idx";
```

The script adds back the `user_id` column, copies `owner_id` values to it, drops the `owner_id` column, and removes the index created in the "up" migration.

## Configuration
The migration scripts use the following configuration:

1. Table name: `topics`
2. New column name: `owner_id`
3. Old column name: `user_id`
4. Default value for `owner_id`: '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000'
5. Index name: "topics_dataset_id_owner_id_idx"

These values are hardcoded in the migration scripts and should be adjusted if the table or column names differ in the actual database schema.

The migration assumes that the database system supports standard SQL syntax for ALTER TABLE, UPDATE, CREATE INDEX, and DROP INDEX operations. The specific database system (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) is not explicitly mentioned, so it's important to ensure compatibility with the target database before applying the migration.
