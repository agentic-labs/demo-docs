## High-level description
This SQL script migrates the `topics` table by replacing the existing `user_id` column with a new `owner_id` column. It also creates an index on `dataset_id` and `owner_id` for improved query performance.

## Symbols
### `up.sql`
#### Description
This SQL script defines the "up" migration for replacing the `user_id` column with `owner_id` in the `topics` table. It performs the following steps:

1. **Add `owner_id` column:** Adds a new column named `owner_id` to the `topics` table. The column is of type `TEXT`, not nullable, and has a default value of '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000'.
2. **Populate `owner_id`:** Copies the values from the `user_id` column to the newly added `owner_id` column for all rows where `user_id` is not NULL.
3. **Drop `user_id` column:** Removes the existing `user_id` column from the `topics` table.
4. **Create index:** Creates an index named `topics_dataset_id_owner_id_idx` on the `topics` table using the `dataset_id` and `owner_id` columns. This index is expected to speed up queries that filter or order by these columns. 

#### Internal Logic
The script uses standard SQL `ALTER TABLE`, `UPDATE`, and `CREATE INDEX` statements to perform the migration. 

#### Side Effects
- Modifies the schema of the `topics` table by adding and removing columns.
- Adds data to the newly created `owner_id` column.
- Creates a new index on the `topics` table.
