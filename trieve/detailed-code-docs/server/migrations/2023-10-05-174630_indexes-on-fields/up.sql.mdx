## High-level description
This SQL migration file creates a GIN (Generalized Inverted Index) index on the `metadata` column of the `card_metadata` table. The purpose of this index is to improve the performance of queries that search or filter based on the JSON data stored in the `metadata` column.

## Symbols

### `CREATE INDEX json_gin ON card_metadata USING gin (metadata);`
#### Description
This SQL command creates a GIN index named `json_gin` on the `metadata` column of the `card_metadata` table.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `CREATE INDEX` statement initiates the index creation process.
2. `json_gin` is the name given to the new index.
3. `ON card_metadata` specifies the table on which the index is being created.
4. `USING gin` indicates that a GIN index type is being used, which is particularly useful for indexing JSON data.
5. `(metadata)` specifies the column being indexed, which is the `metadata` column.

## Performance Considerations
GIN indexes are particularly useful for improving the performance of queries that involve searching or filtering JSON data. By creating this index:

1. Queries that search for specific key-value pairs within the JSON `metadata` column will be significantly faster.
2. Full-text search operations on the JSON data will also benefit from improved performance.
3. The trade-off is that write operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) on the `card_metadata` table may become slightly slower due to the need to update the index.
4. The database will require more storage space to maintain this index.

It's important to note that while this index will improve query performance, it should be used judiciously, considering the balance between read and write operations in the application and the available storage space.
