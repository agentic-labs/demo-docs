## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for creating and dropping an index on the `metadata` column of the `card_metadata` table in a database. The migration is dated 2023-10-05 and is specifically focused on adding indexes to certain fields.

## What does it do?
The migration scripts in this directory perform the following actions:

1. The "up" migration creates a GIN (Generalized Inverted Index) index named `json_gin` on the `metadata` column of the `card_metadata` table. This index is designed to improve query performance for operations involving the JSONB data stored in the `metadata` column.

2. The "down" migration provides a way to revert the changes made by the "up" migration. It drops the `json_gin` index if it exists, effectively undoing the index creation.

These scripts allow database administrators or application developers to easily apply or roll back changes to the database schema, specifically related to indexing the `metadata` column for improved query performance.

## Key Files

1. `up.sql`:
   - This file contains the SQL statement to create the `json_gin` index.
   - It uses the GIN index type, which is optimized for indexing JSONB data.
   - The index is created on the `metadata` column of the `card_metadata` table.

2. `down.sql`:
   - This file contains the SQL statement to drop the `json_gin` index.
   - It uses the `IF EXISTS` clause to ensure the statement doesn't fail if the index doesn't exist.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files in this directory, the migration scripts themselves serve as a form of configuration for the database schema. The naming convention of the directory (2023-10-05-174630_indexes-on-fields) suggests that this migration is part of a larger migration system, likely managed by an ORM or database migration tool.

Key points about the configuration:

1. Index Name: The index is named `json_gin`. This name is used consistently in both the `up.sql` and `down.sql` scripts.

2. Table Name: The index is created on the `card_metadata` table. This table name is hardcoded in the `up.sql` script.

3. Column Name: The index is created on the `metadata` column. This column name is hardcoded in the `up.sql` script.

4. Index Type: The migration uses a GIN index, which is specified in the `up.sql` script using the `USING gin` clause.

When applying this migration, database administrators should be aware of these configuration details and ensure they align with the existing database schema and application requirements.
