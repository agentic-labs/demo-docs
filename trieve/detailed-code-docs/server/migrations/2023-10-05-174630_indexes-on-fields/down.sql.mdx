title: "down.sql"
---

## High-level description
This SQL script reverts the database migration defined in the corresponding `up.sql` file, specifically by dropping an index named `json_gin`. This suggests that the `up.sql` file likely creates this index, and this "down" script is designed to undo that change during a database rollback.

## Symbols

### `drop index json_gin if exists;`
#### Description
This SQL statement attempts to drop an index named `json_gin`. The `if exists` clause makes the operation conditional: the index is only dropped if it already exists in the database. This prevents errors if the index is not present, making the script more robust for rollback scenarios.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Check for Existence:** The database checks if an index named `json_gin` exists.
2. **Conditional Drop:**
   - If the index exists, it is dropped from the database.
   - If the index doesn't exist, the statement completes without taking any action.

#### Side Effects
- **Index Removal:** If the `json_gin` index exists, it will be removed from the database. This can impact the performance of queries that previously utilized this index.
- **Transaction Safety:** The `if exists` clause ensures that the script can be safely executed even if the index has already been dropped, making the rollback operation more reliable.
