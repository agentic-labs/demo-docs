## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for transitioning the notification system from a user-centric model to a dataset-centric model. The migration is identified as "2024-01-23-012420_move_notifications_to_datasets", indicating it was created on January 23, 2024, at 01:24:20. The directory includes both "up" and "down" migration scripts to apply and revert the changes, respectively.

## What does it do?
The migration accomplishes the following:

1. Shifts the focus of notifications from users to datasets.
2. Modifies existing tables to reflect this change in focus:
   - Renames `user_notification_counts` to `dataset_notification_counts`.
   - Removes `user_uuid` columns and adds `dataset_uuid` columns where necessary.
3. Creates a trigger function to automatically update notification counts for datasets when notifications are added or removed.

These changes allow the system to track and manage notifications on a per-dataset basis rather than per-user, which could be useful for applications where multiple users interact with the same datasets and need to be notified of changes or updates.

## Key Files

### up.sql
This file contains the SQL commands to apply the migration. It performs the following operations:

1. Removes the `user_uuid` column from the `file_upload_completed_notifications` table.
2. Renames `user_notification_counts` to `dataset_notification_counts`.
3. Adds a `dataset_uuid` column to `dataset_notification_counts`.
4. Removes the `user_uuid` column from `dataset_notification_counts`.
5. Creates a trigger function `update_notification_count()` to maintain notification counts for datasets automatically.

Key code snippet for the trigger function:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_notification_count()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
    IF (TG_OP = 'INSERT') THEN
        INSERT INTO dataset_notification_counts (dataset_uuid, notification_count)
        VALUES (NEW.dataset_uuid, 1)
        ON CONFLICT (dataset_uuid)
        DO UPDATE SET notification_count = dataset_notification_counts.notification_count + 1;
    ELSIF (TG_OP = 'DELETE') THEN
        UPDATE dataset_notification_counts
        SET notification_count = notification_count - 1
        WHERE user_uuid = OLD.dataset_uuid;
    END IF;
    RETURN NULL;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

### down.sql
This file contains the SQL commands to revert the migration. It performs the following operations:

1. Adds a `user_uuid` column to the `dataset_notification_counts` table.
2. Removes the `dataset_uuid` column from `dataset_notification_counts`.
3. Renames `dataset_notification_counts` back to `user_notification_counts`.
4. Adds a `user_uuid` column to the `file_upload_completed_notifications` table.

## Configuration
The migration scripts do not rely on external configuration files or environment variables. However, they assume the existence of certain tables and columns in the database schema before the migration is applied.

## TODOs
There are two important TODOs identified in the migration:

1. The trigger function `update_notification_count()` needs to be associated with the appropriate table containing dataset notifications. This association is not specified in the provided code.

2. There is a potential error in the `DELETE` logic of the trigger function. It uses `user_uuid = OLD.dataset_uuid` in the `WHERE` clause, which is incorrect as `user_uuid` has been removed from the `dataset_notification_counts` table. This should be corrected to `dataset_uuid = OLD.dataset_uuid`.

These TODOs should be addressed to ensure the proper functioning of the notification system after the migration is applied.
