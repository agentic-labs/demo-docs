## High-level description

### `down.sql`
#### Description
This SQL script performs a database migration rollback, reverting changes related to notification storage. It modifies the `dataset_notification_counts` table by adding a `user_uuid` column, dropping the `dataset_uuid` column, and renaming the table to `user_notification_counts`. Additionally, it adds a `user_uuid` column to the `file_upload_completed_notifications` table.

#### Internal Logic
The script executes the following SQL statements:

1. **`ALTER TABLE dataset_notification_counts ADD COLUMN user_uuid uuid;`**
   - Adds a new column named `user_uuid` of type `uuid` to the `dataset_notification_counts` table. This column likely stores the UUID of the user associated with the notification count.

2. **`ALTER TABLE dataset_notification_counts DROP COLUMN dataset_uuid;`**
   - Removes the `dataset_uuid` column from the `dataset_notification_counts` table. This suggests that the migration being rolled back involved moving away from associating notification counts with datasets.

3. **`ALTER TABLE dataset_notification_counts RENAME TO user_notification_counts;`**
   - Renames the `dataset_notification_counts` table to `user_notification_counts`. This further indicates that the rollback is shifting the focus of notifications from datasets to users.

4. **`ALTER TABLE file_upload_completed_notifications ADD COLUMN user_uuid uuid;`**
   - Adds a new column named `user_uuid` of type `uuid` to the `file_upload_completed_notifications` table. This likely associates file upload completion notifications with specific users.

These steps collectively revert the database schema to its state before the migration `2024-01-23-012420_move_notifications_to_datasets` was applied.
