## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration files for adding an `image_urls` column to the `chunk_metadata` table in the database. The migration is dated 2024-05-16 and is identified by the timestamp 173746. The directory includes two SQL files: `up.sql` for applying the change and `down.sql` for reverting it.

## What does it do?
This migration adds a new capability to the database by introducing an `image_urls` column to the `chunk_metadata` table. This column is designed to store multiple image URLs associated with each chunk of metadata. The `up.sql` file adds this new column, while the `down.sql` file provides a way to remove it if needed. This change allows the application to associate multiple images with each metadata chunk, which could be useful for various features such as displaying thumbnails, providing visual context for text chunks, or linking to full-size images.

## Key Files

1. `up.sql`: This file contains the SQL command to add the `image_urls` column to the `chunk_metadata` table. The new column is defined as an array of TEXT values, allowing multiple URLs to be stored for each row.

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE chunk_metadata ADD COLUMN image_urls TEXT[]
   ```

2. `down.sql`: This file contains the SQL command to remove the `image_urls` column from the `chunk_metadata` table, effectively reverting the changes made by `up.sql`.

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE chunk_metadata DROP COLUMN image_urls;
   ```

## Dependencies
This migration is likely part of a database migration system, possibly using a tool like Diesel for Rust or another database migration framework. The specific framework is not mentioned in the provided files, but the structure of having separate `up.sql` and `down.sql` files is common in many migration systems.

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration files or environment variables mentioned in these migration files. However, the migration system being used may require configuration to specify the database connection details and migration directory.

## Performance Considerations
Adding a new column to an existing table can be a potentially time-consuming operation, especially if the `chunk_metadata` table contains a large number of rows. The use of an array type (TEXT[]) for the `image_urls` column may have implications for indexing and querying performance, particularly for large arrays or when performing complex queries involving this column.

## Error Handling
The SQL statements in both files do not include explicit error handling. If issues arise during the migration (e.g., the column already exists when trying to add it, or it doesn't exist when trying to remove it), the database system will typically raise an error, and the migration will fail. Proper error handling should be implemented in the application or migration tool that executes these SQL scripts.

## TODOs
The `up.sql` file contains a comment "-- Your SQL goes here" at the beginning, which suggests that this might be a template or placeholder for migration scripts. In a production environment, it's recommended to remove or replace such comments with more specific documentation about the purpose of this migration.

## Side Effects
Executing the `up.sql` migration will modify the structure of the `chunk_metadata` table, adding the `image_urls` column to all existing rows (initially with NULL values). Any applications or queries that interact with the `chunk_metadata` table will need to be updated to account for the new column if they intend to use it.

Conversely, running the `down.sql` migration will permanently remove the `image_urls` column and all its data from the `chunk_metadata` table. This operation cannot be undone without restoring from a backup or re-running the `up.sql` migration.

In both cases, it's crucial to ensure that all related application code and database queries are updated accordingly to maintain consistency and prevent errors.
