## High-level description
This SQL migration script adds a new column named `image_urls` to the `chunk_metadata` table. The new column is designed to store an array of text values, presumably to hold URLs of images associated with each chunk of metadata.

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE chunk_metadata ADD COLUMN image_urls TEXT[]
#### Description
This SQL command alters the existing `chunk_metadata` table by adding a new column called `image_urls`. The column is defined as an array of TEXT values, which allows storing multiple image URLs for each row in the table.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `ALTER TABLE` statement is used to modify the structure of an existing table.
2. `chunk_metadata` is the name of the table being altered.
3. `ADD COLUMN` specifies that a new column is being added to the table.
4. `image_urls` is the name of the new column being added.
5. `TEXT[]` defines the data type of the new column as an array of TEXT values.

## Side Effects
- This migration will modify the structure of the `chunk_metadata` table in the database.
- Existing rows in the table will have a new `image_urls` column, which will initially be NULL.
- Any applications or queries that interact with the `chunk_metadata` table will need to be updated to account for the new column, if they intend to use it.

## Performance Considerations
- Adding a new column to an existing table with a large number of rows can be a potentially time-consuming operation, depending on the database system and the amount of data in the table.
- The use of an array type (TEXT[]) may have implications for indexing and querying performance, especially for large arrays or when performing complex queries involving this column.

## TODOs
The comment "-- Your SQL goes here" at the beginning of the file suggests that this might be a template or placeholder for migration scripts. In a production environment, it's recommended to remove or replace such comments with more specific documentation about the purpose of this migration.
