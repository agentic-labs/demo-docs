title: "down.sql"
---

## High-level description
This SQL migration file is designed to revert the changes made in the corresponding `up.sql` file. It removes the `image_urls` column from the `chunk_metadata` table in the database.

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE chunk_metadata DROP COLUMN image_urls;
#### Description
This SQL statement removes the `image_urls` column from the `chunk_metadata` table.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `ALTER TABLE` command is used to modify the structure of an existing table.
2. `chunk_metadata` is the name of the table being altered.
3. `DROP COLUMN` is used to remove a column from the table.
4. `image_urls` is the name of the column being removed.

## Side Effects
Executing this SQL statement will permanently remove the `image_urls` column and all its data from the `chunk_metadata` table. This operation cannot be undone without restoring from a backup or re-running the corresponding `up.sql` migration.

## Dependencies
This migration file is part of a database migration system, likely using a tool such as Diesel for Rust or another database migration framework.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this SQL statement. If the column doesn't exist or if there are any dependencies on this column, the database system will typically raise an error, and the migration will fail.

## TODOs
The comment at the top of the file suggests that this `down.sql` file should undo anything done in the corresponding `up.sql` file. It's important to ensure that this statement correctly reverses all changes made in the `up.sql` file to maintain database consistency during migrations.
