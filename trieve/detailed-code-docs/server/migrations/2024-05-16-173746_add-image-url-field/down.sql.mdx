title: "down.sql"
---

## High-level description
This SQL script defines a database migration rollback action. It specifically reverts a change made to the `chunk_metadata` table, removing the `image_urls` column that was presumably added in the corresponding `up.sql` migration script.

## Symbols

### `ALTER TABLE chunk_metadata DROP COLUMN image_urls;`
#### Description
This SQL statement removes the `image_urls` column from the `chunk_metadata` table. This action is intended to reverse the addition of this column in a previous migration.

#### Internal Logic
- **`ALTER TABLE chunk_metadata`**: This clause specifies that the `chunk_metadata` table is being modified.
- **`DROP COLUMN image_urls`**: This clause instructs the database to remove the column named `image_urls`.

#### Side Effects
This statement directly modifies the database schema by removing a column from the `chunk_metadata` table. Any data previously stored in the `image_urls` column will be permanently deleted.
