## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for modifying the `dataset_tags` table in a database. The migration introduces a new unique constraint on the combination of `dataset_id` and `tag` columns, while removing previously existing constraints. The directory includes both "up" and "down" migration scripts to allow for applying and reverting these changes.

## What does it do?
The migration scripts in this directory make changes to how data is organized and constrained in the `dataset_tags` table of a database. Here's a simplified explanation of what these scripts do:

1. The "up" migration:
   - Removes two existing constraints that were ensuring uniqueness on certain columns.
   - Adds a new rule that says for each dataset, you can't have duplicate tags. In other words, a combination of a dataset ID and a tag must be unique in the table.

2. The "down" migration:
   - Removes the new rule about unique dataset-tag combinations.
   - Puts back two rules: one that says the combination of ID and dataset ID must be unique, and another that says tags themselves must be unique across all datasets.

These changes affect how data can be stored and retrieved from the `dataset_tags` table, ensuring data integrity and preventing certain types of duplicate entries.

## Key Files

1. `up.sql`:
   This file contains the SQL commands to apply the new changes to the database schema. It drops existing constraints and adds a new unique constraint on the `dataset_id` and `tag` columns of the `dataset_tags` table.

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE dataset_tags DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS dataset_tags_tag;
   ALTER TABLE dataset_tags DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS dataset_tags_id_dataset_id;
   ALTER TABLE dataset_tags ADD CONSTRAINT dataset_tags_dataset_id_tag_key UNIQUE (dataset_id, tag);
   ```

2. `down.sql`:
   This file contains the SQL commands to revert the changes made by the `up.sql` script. It drops the new constraint and re-adds the previously existing constraints.

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE dataset_tags DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS dataset_tags_dataset_id_tag_key;
   ALTER TABLE dataset_tags ADD CONSTRAINT dataset_tags_id_dataset_id UNIQUE(id, dataset_id);
   ALTER TABLE dataset_tags ADD CONSTRAINT dataset_tags_tag UNIQUE(tag);
   ```

These files work together to provide a reversible database migration, allowing developers to apply or roll back changes to the database schema as needed.

## Configuration
The migration is identified by its timestamp: `2024-06-08-003433`. This timestamp is likely used by a migration tool to track which migrations have been applied and in what order.

No additional configuration files or environment variables are specified for this migration.
