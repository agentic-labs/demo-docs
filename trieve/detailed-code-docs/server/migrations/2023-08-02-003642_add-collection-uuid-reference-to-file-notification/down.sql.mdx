## High-level description
This SQL script is a database migration file designed to undo the changes made in the corresponding `up.sql` file. It removes a foreign key constraint from the `file_upload_completed_notifications` table, effectively reverting it to its original state without the reference to the `collections` table.

### SQL Migration Script
#### Description
This script performs a series of SQL operations to remove a foreign key constraint from the `file_upload_completed_notifications` table. It does this by creating a temporary table, copying data, dropping the original table, recreating it without the constraint, and then copying the data back.

#### Internal Logic
1. Create a temporary table `file_upload_completed_notifications_temp` with the original structure (without foreign key constraint).
2. Copy all data from the current `file_upload_completed_notifications` table to the temporary table.
3. Drop the current `file_upload_completed_notifications` table (which has the foreign key constraint).
4. Recreate the `file_upload_completed_notifications` table without the foreign key constraint.
5. Copy all data from the temporary table back to the newly created `file_upload_completed_notifications` table.
6. Drop the temporary table.

## Side Effects
- Temporarily duplicates data in a temporary table.
- Drops and recreates the `file_upload_completed_notifications` table.
- Removes any foreign key constraint that was previously added to the `file_upload_completed_notifications` table.

## Performance Considerations
This migration involves copying potentially large amounts of data twice (to and from a temporary table). For large tables, this operation could be time-consuming and resource-intensive. It's advisable to run this migration during low-traffic periods.

## Error Handling
This script does not include explicit error handling. If an error occurs during execution, the database system will likely roll back the entire transaction, leaving the database in its original state.

## TODOs
The comment at the top of the file, "This file should undo anything in `up.sql`", suggests that this script is intended to reverse the changes made in a corresponding `up.sql` file. It's important to ensure that this script accurately undoes all changes made in the `up.sql` file to maintain database integrity during migrations.
