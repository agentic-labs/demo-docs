## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for adding a foreign key constraint to the `collection_uuid` column in the `file_upload_completed_notifications` table, referencing the `id` column of the `card_collection` table. The migration is designed to be reversible, with separate scripts for applying (up.sql) and reverting (down.sql) the changes.

## What does it do?
The migration accomplishes the following:

1. In the "up" direction:
   - It adds a foreign key constraint to the `collection_uuid` column in the `file_upload_completed_notifications` table.
   - This constraint references the `id` column of the `card_collection` table.
   - The process involves creating a temporary table, copying data, recreating the original table with the new constraint, and then copying the data back.

2. In the "down" direction:
   - It removes the foreign key constraint from the `file_upload_completed_notifications` table.
   - This effectively reverts the table to its original state without the reference to the `collections` table.
   - The process is similar to the "up" direction, using a temporary table to preserve data while modifying the table structure.

These changes allow for maintaining referential integrity between file upload notifications and card collections in the database.

## Key Files

1. `up.sql`:
   - This file contains the SQL script to apply the migration.
   - It adds the foreign key constraint to the `file_upload_completed_notifications` table.
   - The script uses a six-step process involving temporary tables to preserve existing data.

2. `down.sql`:
   - This file contains the SQL script to revert the migration.
   - It removes the foreign key constraint from the `file_upload_completed_notifications` table.
   - The script uses a similar process to `up.sql`, creating a temporary table to preserve data while modifying the table structure.

## Configuration
Both scripts use SQL commands and do not require additional configuration. However, they assume the existence of certain tables and columns:

- `file_upload_completed_notifications` table
- `card_collection` table
- `collection_uuid` column in the `file_upload_completed_notifications` table
- `id` column in the `card_collection` table

## Performance Considerations
Both the `up.sql` and `down.sql` scripts involve copying potentially large amounts of data twice (to and from a temporary table). For large tables, these operations could be time-consuming and resource-intensive. It's advisable to run these migrations during low-traffic periods to minimize impact on system performance.

## Error Handling
Neither script includes explicit error handling. If an error occurs during execution, the database system will likely roll back the entire transaction, leaving the database in its original state. However, because the operations are not atomic, there's a risk of leaving the database in an inconsistent state if an error occurs mid-process. Manual intervention may be required in such cases.

## Side Effects
- The `up.sql` script adds a foreign key constraint to the `file_upload_completed_notifications` table. This means that any existing rows in this table with `collection_uuid` values that don't exist in the `card_collection` table will cause the migration to fail.
- Both scripts temporarily duplicate data in a temporary table and involve dropping and recreating the `file_upload_completed_notifications` table.

## Code Snippets
Here's a simplified version of the key operations in `up.sql`:

```sql
-- Create temporary table
CREATE TABLE file_upload_completed_notifications_temp (
    -- ... (column definitions)
);

-- Copy data to temporary table
INSERT INTO file_upload_completed_notifications_temp SELECT * FROM file_upload_completed_notifications;

-- Drop original table
DROP TABLE file_upload_completed_notifications;

-- Recreate original table with foreign key constraint
CREATE TABLE file_upload_completed_notifications (
    -- ... (column definitions)
    FOREIGN KEY (collection_uuid) REFERENCES card_collection(id)
);

-- Copy data back to original table
INSERT INTO file_upload_completed_notifications SELECT * FROM file_upload_completed_notifications_temp;

-- Drop temporary table
DROP TABLE file_upload_completed_notifications_temp;
```

The `down.sql` script follows a similar pattern but omits the foreign key constraint when recreating the table.

In conclusion, these migration scripts provide a mechanism for adding and removing a foreign key constraint to maintain referential integrity between file upload notifications and card collections, while preserving existing data during the process.
