## High-level description
This SQL migration script adds a foreign key constraint to the `collection_uuid` column in the `file_upload_completed_notifications` table, referencing the `id` column of the `card_collection` table. The script uses a temporary table to preserve existing data while restructuring the table.

## Code Structure
The migration script is structured in six sequential steps, each performing a specific operation to achieve the desired table modification without losing data.

## Symbols

### Step 1: Create a temporary table
#### Description
Creates a new temporary table `file_upload_completed_notifications_temp` with the same structure as the original table but without the foreign key constraint.

#### Internal Logic
- Creates a new table with columns: id, user_uuid, collection_uuid, user_read, created_at, and updated_at
- Sets default values and constraints for some columns

### Step 2: Copy data to temporary table
#### Description
Copies all data from the original `file_upload_completed_notifications` table to the temporary table.

### Step 3: Drop original table
#### Description
Drops the original `file_upload_completed_notifications` table.

### Step 4: Recreate original table with foreign key constraint
#### Description
Recreates the `file_upload_completed_notifications` table with the same structure as before, but adds a foreign key constraint to the `collection_uuid` column.

#### Internal Logic
- Creates a new table with the same columns as the temporary table
- Adds a foreign key constraint on `collection_uuid` referencing `card_collection(id)`

### Step 5: Copy data back to original table
#### Description
Copies all data from the temporary table back to the newly created `file_upload_completed_notifications` table.

### Step 6: Drop temporary table
#### Description
Drops the temporary `file_upload_completed_notifications_temp` table.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| card_collection table | The `id` column is referenced by the new foreign key constraint |

## Performance Considerations
This migration might take longer to execute on tables with a large amount of data, as it involves copying all data twice (to and from the temporary table). It's recommended to run this migration during low-traffic periods.
