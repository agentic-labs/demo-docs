## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for updating the foreign key constraint in the `chunk_group_bookmarks` table. The migration is dated 2024-02-05 and is specifically focused on changing the relationship between bookmarks and metadata from card-based to chunk-based.

## What does it do?
The migration scripts in this directory perform a database schema change that affects how bookmarks are associated with metadata. Here's a simplified explanation of what these scripts do:

1. The "up" script changes the bookmarks to be linked to "chunk metadata" instead of "card metadata". This is like updating a filing system where bookmarks were previously organized by cards, but now they're organized by chunks of information.

2. The "down" script does the opposite. It reverts the change, making bookmarks once again associated with card metadata instead of chunk metadata. This is useful if there's a need to undo the changes made by the "up" script.

These changes affect how the system manages and relates bookmarks to other data, potentially impacting how users interact with bookmarked content or how the application processes and displays bookmarked information.

## Key Files

### up.sql
This file contains the SQL commands to implement the new schema changes. It performs two main actions:
1. Removes the old foreign key constraint that linked bookmarks to card metadata.
2. Adds a new foreign key constraint that links bookmarks to chunk metadata.

The new constraint is set up with cascading delete and update operations, meaning if a chunk of metadata is deleted or updated, related bookmarks will be automatically deleted or updated accordingly.

### down.sql
This file contains the SQL commands to revert the changes made by `up.sql`. It:
1. Removes the foreign key constraint that links bookmarks to chunk metadata.
2. Adds back the original foreign key constraint that links bookmarks to card metadata.

Like the `up.sql` script, this also sets up cascading delete and update operations.

## Configuration
This migration doesn't require any specific configuration. However, it's important to note that the migration is identified by its timestamp: `2024-02-05-201448`. This timestamp ensures that migrations are applied in the correct order and helps prevent conflicts when multiple developers are working on database changes.

The naming convention used here (`YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS_description`) is a common practice in database migration systems, allowing for easy chronological ordering and identification of migrations.

When running these migrations, database management tools or ORM systems typically use these files to track which migrations have been applied and in what order, ensuring database schema consistency across different environments.
