## High-level description
This SQL script reverts the changes made by the migration `2024-02-05-201448_update-bookmark-foreign-id`. It specifically undoes modifications to the foreign key constraint on the `chunk_group_bookmarks` table.

### `down.sql`
#### Description
This script reverts the database schema changes introduced by the corresponding `up.sql` migration script. It performs two main actions:

1. **Drops the existing foreign key constraint:** `chunk_group_bookmarks_chunk_metadata_id_fkey` is dropped from the `chunk_group_bookmarks` table. This constraint likely enforced a relationship between `chunk_group_bookmarks` and the `chunk_metadata` table.

2. **Adds a new foreign key constraint:** A new constraint named `card_collection_bookmarks_card_metadata_id_fkey` is added to the `chunk_group_bookmarks` table. This constraint establishes a foreign key relationship between the `chunk_metadata_id` column in `chunk_group_bookmarks` and the `id` column in the `chunk_metadata` table. The `ON DELETE CASCADE` and `ON UPDATE CASCADE` options ensure that if a record in `chunk_metadata` is deleted or updated, the corresponding records in `chunk_group_bookmarks` are also deleted or updated accordingly.

#### Internal Logic
The script uses standard SQL `ALTER TABLE` statements to modify the table structure and constraints. 

* `DROP CONSTRAINT` removes the existing foreign key constraint.
* `ADD CONSTRAINT` adds the new foreign key constraint, specifying the referenced table and columns, and the desired cascade behavior.
