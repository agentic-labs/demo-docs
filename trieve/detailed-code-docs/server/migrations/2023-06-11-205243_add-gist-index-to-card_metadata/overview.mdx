## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for adding and removing a GIN index and a `card_metadata_tsvector` column to the `card_metadata` table. These changes are likely implemented to support full-text search functionality in the application.

## What does it do?
The migration scripts in this directory modify the database structure to enhance the search capabilities of the application:

1. The "up" migration adds a new column called `card_metadata_tsvector` to the `card_metadata` table. This column is designed to store pre-processed text data optimized for full-text searches.

2. It then populates this new column with processed text data from the existing `content` column, using PostgreSQL's `to_tsvector` function. This function converts the text into a format that's optimized for searching.

3. Finally, it creates a special type of index called a GIN (Generalized Inverted Index) on this new column. This index significantly speeds up full-text search operations.

4. The "down" migration does the opposite: it removes the index and the `card_metadata_tsvector` column, effectively undoing the changes made by the "up" migration.

These changes allow the application to perform fast and efficient full-text searches on the content stored in the `card_metadata` table.

## Key Files

1. `up.sql`: This file contains the SQL commands to implement the new full-text search functionality.

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE card_metadata ADD COLUMN card_metadata_tsvector TSVECTOR;
   UPDATE card_metadata SET card_metadata_tsvector = to_tsvector('english', content);
   CREATE INDEX idx_card_metadata_tsvector ON card_metadata USING GIN(card_metadata_tsvector);
   ```

   It adds the `card_metadata_tsvector` column, populates it with processed text data, and creates a GIN index on this column.

2. `down.sql`: This file contains the SQL commands to revert the changes made by `up.sql`.

   ```sql
   DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_card_metadata_tsvector;
   ALTER TABLE card_metadata DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS card_metadata_tsvector;
   ```

   It drops the GIN index and removes the `card_metadata_tsvector` column.

## Configuration
The migration scripts use PostgreSQL-specific features:

1. The `TSVECTOR` data type is used for storing pre-processed text for full-text search operations.
2. The `to_tsvector` function is used with the 'english' language parameter, indicating that the text processing is optimized for English language content.
3. The GIN index type is used, which is specifically designed for efficient searching of `tsvector` data.

These configurations suggest that the application is using PostgreSQL as its database system and is optimized for English language content in its full-text search functionality.
