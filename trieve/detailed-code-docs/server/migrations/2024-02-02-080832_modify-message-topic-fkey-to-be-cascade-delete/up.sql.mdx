## High-level description
This SQL script modifies the foreign key constraint `messages_topic_id_fkey` on the `messages` table. 
It makes the constraint enforce cascading deletes, meaning when a topic is deleted, all associated messages are also deleted.

### `ALTER TABLE messages ...`
#### Description
This block of SQL code alters the `messages` table to modify the foreign key constraint that links it to the `topics` table.

#### Internal Logic
1. **`DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS messages_topic_id_fkey;`**: This line first attempts to drop the existing foreign key constraint named `messages_topic_id_fkey`. The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the operation doesn't fail if the constraint doesn't already exist.
2. **`ALTER TABLE messages ADD CONSTRAINT messages_topic_id_fkey FOREIGN KEY (topic_id) REFERENCES topics(id) ON UPDATE CASCADE ON DELETE CASCADE;`**: This line adds a new foreign key constraint named `messages_topic_id_fkey` to the `messages` table. 
    - `FOREIGN KEY (topic_id)` specifies that the `topic_id` column in the `messages` table is the foreign key.
    - `REFERENCES topics(id)` indicates that this foreign key references the `id` column in the `topics` table.
    - `ON UPDATE CASCADE` means that if the `id` of a topic is updated, the corresponding `topic_id` in the `messages` table will be automatically updated to match.
    - `ON DELETE CASCADE` is the crucial change made by this migration script. It ensures that if a topic is deleted from the `topics` table, all messages associated with that topic (i.e., messages with the corresponding `topic_id`) will also be automatically deleted from the `messages` table.
