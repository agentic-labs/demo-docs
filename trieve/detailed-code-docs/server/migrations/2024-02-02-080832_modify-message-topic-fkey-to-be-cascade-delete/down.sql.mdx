## High-level description
This SQL migration script reverts a database schema change related to the foreign key constraint between the `messages` and `topics` tables. It specifically undoes the cascade delete behavior that was likely implemented in the corresponding `up.sql` migration.

## Symbols

### `ALTER TABLE messages DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS messages_topic_id_fkey;`
#### Description
This statement drops the foreign key constraint named `messages_topic_id_fkey` on the `messages` table if it exists. This action allows for subsequent modifications to the constraint without errors if it was already present.

#### Internal Logic
- It uses `DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS` to avoid errors if the constraint doesn't exist.
- `messages_topic_id_fkey` is the assumed name of the foreign key constraint being reverted.

### `ALTER TABLE messages ADD CONSTRAINT messages_topic_id_fkey FOREIGN KEY (topic_id) REFERENCES topics(id);`
#### Description
This statement adds a foreign key constraint, named `messages_topic_id_fkey`, to the `messages` table. This constraint establishes a relationship between the `topic_id` column in the `messages` table and the `id` column in the `topics` table. 

#### Internal Logic
- `ALTER TABLE ... ADD CONSTRAINT` is used to add a new constraint.
- `FOREIGN KEY (topic_id) REFERENCES topics(id)` defines the foreign key relationship, linking `topic_id` in `messages` to `id` in `topics`. 

## Side Effects
- **Database Schema Change:** This script modifies the database schema by reverting the foreign key constraint between the `messages` and `topics` tables. This change affects how data integrity is maintained between these tables.
- **Data Integrity:** Removing the cascade delete behavior means that deleting a topic will no longer automatically delete associated messages. This could lead to orphaned records (messages without a corresponding topic) if not handled properly in application logic.
