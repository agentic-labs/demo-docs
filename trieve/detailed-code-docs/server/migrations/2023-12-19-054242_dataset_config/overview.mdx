## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration files for adding a new `configuration` column to the `datasets` table in a database. The migration is dated 2023-12-19 and is specifically for dataset configuration.

## What does it do?
This migration adds a new capability to the database by introducing a `configuration` column to the `datasets` table. This column is designed to store JSON data, allowing for flexible and structured configuration settings for each dataset. The migration ensures that every dataset will have a configuration, even if it's just an empty JSON object.

The migration is set up in two parts:
1. An "up" migration that adds the new column
2. A "down" migration that, in this case, doesn't perform any action (it's empty)

This structure allows for applying the change (adding the column) and potentially reverting it if needed, although the reversion logic is not implemented in this case.

## Key Files

### up.sql
This file contains the SQL command to alter the `datasets` table by adding the new `configuration` column. Here's what it does:

```sql
ALTER TABLE datasets
ADD COLUMN configuration JSONB NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}'::JSONB;
```

- It adds a new column named `configuration` to the `datasets` table.
- The column type is `JSONB`, which is a binary JSON format in PostgreSQL, optimized for efficiency.
- It's set as `NOT NULL`, meaning every row must have a value for this column.
- It has a default value of an empty JSON object (`{}`), ensuring that existing rows and new rows without a specified configuration will still have a valid JSON value.

### down.sql
This file is empty, which means the migration doesn't provide a way to automatically revert the changes made by `up.sql`. This is likely because removing a column could potentially lead to data loss, so it's left to be handled manually if needed.

## Dependencies
This migration relies on PostgreSQL's JSONB data type, which suggests that the database system in use is PostgreSQL. The version of PostgreSQL should support JSONB (introduced in PostgreSQL 9.4).

## Configuration
The migration itself doesn't require any additional configuration. However, it introduces a new configurable aspect to the application:

- Each dataset can now have a JSON configuration stored in the `configuration` column.
- The default configuration is an empty JSON object (`{}`).
- Applications using this database will need to be updated to work with this new column, potentially providing interfaces for setting and retrieving configuration data for datasets.

In conclusion, this migration enhances the `datasets` table by adding a flexible configuration storage option. This allows for more dynamic and customizable dataset management within the application, as each dataset can now have its own set of configuration parameters stored in a structured JSON format.
