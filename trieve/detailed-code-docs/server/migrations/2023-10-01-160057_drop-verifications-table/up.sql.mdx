## High-level description
This SQL script defines a database migration that drops two tables: `verification_notifications` and `card_verification`. This suggests that these tables are no longer needed in the database schema.

## Symbols
### `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS verification_notifications`
#### Description
This statement attempts to drop the table named `verification_notifications`. The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the statement executes successfully even if the table does not exist.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Check for existence:** The database checks if a table named `verification_notifications` exists.
2. **Drop if exists:** If the table exists, it is dropped, deleting all data and the table structure.
3. **No action if not exists:** If the table does not exist, no action is taken.

### `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS card_verification`
#### Description
This statement attempts to drop the table named `card_verification`. The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the statement executes successfully even if the table does not exist.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Check for existence:** The database checks if a table named `card_verification` exists.
2. **Drop if exists:** If the table exists, it is dropped, deleting all data and the table structure.
3. **No action if not exists:** If the table does not exist, no action is taken.
