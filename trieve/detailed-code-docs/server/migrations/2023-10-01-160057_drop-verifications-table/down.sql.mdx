title: "down.sql"

## High-level description
This SQL script defines a database migration that reverts changes made in a corresponding `up.sql` migration file. Specifically, it recreates the `verification_notifications` and `card_verification` tables and a unique constraint on the `card_verification` table. This suggests that the `up.sql` migration likely involved dropping these tables and the constraint.

## Code Structure
The code consists of three SQL statements:

1. **`CREATE TABLE verification_notifications ...`**: This statement recreates the `verification_notifications` table and defines its columns and constraints.
2. **`ALTER TABLE card_verification ...`**: This statement adds a unique constraint named `uq_card_id` to the `card_id` column of the `card_verification` table.
3. **`CREATE TABLE public.card_verification ...`**: This statement recreates the `card_verification` table and defines its columns and constraints.

## Symbols

### `verification_notifications` table
#### Description
This table stores information about verification notifications sent to users regarding their cards.

#### Columns
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | UUID | Primary key of the table |
| user_uuid | UUID | Foreign key referencing the `users` table, indicating the user who received the notification |
| card_uuid | UUID | Foreign key referencing the `card_metadata` table, indicating the card related to the notification |
| verification_uuid | UUID | Foreign key referencing the `card_verification` table, indicating the verification event that triggered the notification |
| similarity_score | BigInt | The similarity score calculated during the verification process |
| user_read | boolean | Flag indicating whether the user has read the notification (default: false) |
| created_at | TIMESTAMP | Timestamp of when the notification was created (default: current timestamp) |
| updated_at | TIMESTAMP | Timestamp of when the notification was last updated (default: current timestamp) |

### `card_verification` table
#### Description
This table stores information about card verification events.

#### Columns
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | UUID | Primary key of the table |
| card_id | UUID | Foreign key referencing a card, likely in another table |
| similarity_score | BigInt | The similarity score calculated during the verification process |
| created_at | TIMESTAMP | Timestamp of when the verification event was created (default: current timestamp) |
| updated_at | TIMESTAMP | Timestamp of when the verification event was last updated (default: current timestamp) |

### `uq_card_id` constraint
#### Description
This is a unique constraint on the `card_id` column of the `card_verification` table, ensuring that each card can only have one verification record.
