## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for adding and removing indices on the 'files' and 'card_files' tables in a database. The migration is dated 2023-08-06 and is specifically aimed at improving query performance for these tables.

## What does it do?
The migration scripts in this directory perform two main functions:

1. Adding Indices (up.sql):
   - Creates indices on the 'files' table for columns: user_id, private, created_at, and updated_at.
   - Creates indices on the 'card_files' table for columns: card_id, file_id, created_at, and updated_at.

2. Removing Indices (down.sql):
   - Removes all the indices created by the up.sql script.

These changes are designed to optimize database performance by speeding up queries that filter or sort by the indexed columns. For example, queries that search for files by user_id or filter private files will be faster after this migration is applied.

## Key Files

### up.sql
This file contains the SQL commands to create the new indices. Here's a breakdown of what it does:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_files_user_id ON files (user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_files_private ON files (private);
CREATE INDEX idx_files_created_at ON files (created_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_files_updated_at ON files (updated_at);

CREATE INDEX idx_card_files_card_id ON card_files (card_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_card_files_file_id ON card_files (file_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_card_files_created_at ON card_files (created_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_card_files_updated_at ON card_files (updated_at);
```

Each `CREATE INDEX` statement creates a new index on a specific column of either the 'files' or 'card_files' table. The index names are prefixed with 'idx_' followed by the table name and the column name.

### down.sql
This file contains the SQL commands to remove the indices created by up.sql. Here's what it does:

```sql
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_files_user_id;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_files_private;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_files_created_at;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_files_updated_at;

DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_card_files_card_id;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_card_files_file_id;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_card_files_created_at;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_card_files_updated_at;
```

Each `DROP INDEX IF EXISTS` statement removes the corresponding index created in the up.sql file. The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the script doesn't fail if the index has already been removed.

## Configuration
This migration doesn't require any specific configuration. However, it's important to note that the effectiveness of these indices depends on the database system being used and the specific query patterns of the application. Database administrators or developers may need to monitor query performance after applying this migration to ensure it has the desired effect.
