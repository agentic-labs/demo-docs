## High-level description
This SQL script adds several indices to the 'files' and 'card_files' tables in a database. The purpose of these indices is to improve query performance for frequently accessed columns in these tables.

## Symbols

### CREATE INDEX statements

#### Description
Each `CREATE INDEX` statement creates a new index on a specific column of a table. Indices are used to speed up data retrieval operations on the table, especially for columns that are frequently used in WHERE clauses, JOIN conditions, or ORDER BY clauses.

#### Internal Logic
The script creates indices on the following columns:

For the 'files' table:
1. `user_id`
2. `private`
3. `created_at`
4. `updated_at`

For the 'card_files' table:
1. `card_id`
2. `file_id`
3. `created_at`
4. `updated_at`

Each index is given a name that follows the convention `idx_&lt;table_name&gt;_&lt;column_name&gt;`.

## Performance Considerations
Adding indices can significantly improve query performance for read operations, especially for large tables. However, it's important to note that indices also have some drawbacks:

1. They increase the storage space required for the database.
2. They can slow down write operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) as the indices need to be updated along with the table data.

The choice of columns for indexing in this script suggests that these are frequently queried fields, and the performance benefit for read operations is expected to outweigh the potential slowdown in write operations.

## Dependencies
This SQL script is likely to be executed by a database migration tool, such as Diesel (given the file path includes "migrations"). The script is written in standard SQL and should be compatible with most relational database management systems.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code. However, it's worth noting that the effectiveness of these indices should be monitored over time. If certain indices are not providing significant performance benefits, they could be candidates for removal in future migrations.
