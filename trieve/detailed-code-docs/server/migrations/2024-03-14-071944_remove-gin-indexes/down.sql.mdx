title: "down.sql"

## High-level description
This SQL script defines a database migration that adds several indexes to the `chunk_metadata` table. These indexes are designed to improve query performance for various fields, including `link`, `metadata`, `tag_set`, `updated_at`, `created_at`, and `time_stamp`.

## Symbols
### `down.sql`
#### Description
This SQL script defines the "down" migration for a database schema change. It reverts the changes made by the corresponding "up" migration, which likely involved removing the indexes defined in this file. This script specifically recreates six indexes on the `chunk_metadata` table.

#### Internal Logic
The script executes six `CREATE INDEX` statements:

1. **`idx_link_gin`**: Creates a GIN (Generalized Inverted Index) index on the `link` column using the `gin_trgm_ops` operator class, which is optimized for text similarity search.
2. **`json_gin`**: Creates a GIN index on the `metadata` column, which likely stores JSON data.
3. **`idx_gist`**: Creates a GIN index on the `tag_set` column using the `gin_trgm_ops` operator class, suggesting that `tag_set` might contain text data for similarity searches.
4. **`idx_card_metadata_updated_at`**: Creates a B-tree index on the `updated_at` column, likely a timestamp field.
5. **`idx_card_metadata_created_at`**: Creates a B-tree index on the `created_at` column, likely another timestamp field.
6. **`card_time_stamp_index`**: Creates a B-tree index on the `time_stamp` column, likely a timestamp field.

These indexes are designed to speed up queries that filter or order by the indexed columns.
