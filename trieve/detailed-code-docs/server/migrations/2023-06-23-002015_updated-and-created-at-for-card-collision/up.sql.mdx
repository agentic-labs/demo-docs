## High-level description
This SQL script adds two new columns, `created_at` and `updated_at`, to the `card_collisions` table. These columns will store timestamps and are set to the current time by default.

## Symbols

### `ALTER TABLE card_collisions`
#### Description
This SQL statement modifies the existing `card_collisions` table by adding two new columns.

#### Internal Logic
1. **`ADD COLUMN created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()`**: This part adds a new column named `created_at` to the table. 
    - The data type of the column is `TIMESTAMP`, which stores a date and time. 
    - `NOT NULL` constraint ensures that this column cannot be left empty.
    - `DEFAULT NOW()` sets the default value of the column to the current timestamp whenever a new row is inserted into the table.
2. **`ADD COLUMN updated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()`**: This part adds another column named `updated_at` with the same configurations as `created_at`. This column is intended to store the timestamp of the last update to the row.
