## Symbols

### `down.sql`
#### Description
This SQL script undoes the addition of `created_at` and `updated_at` columns to the `card_collisions` table. This is typically used when rolling back a database migration.

#### Internal Logic
1. **`ALTER TABLE card_collisions`**: This line starts the modification of the `card_collisions` table.
2. **`DROP COLUMN created_at, DROP COLUMN updated_at;`**: These lines remove the specified columns (`created_at` and `updated_at`) from the `card_collisions` table.

#### Side Effects
- **Data Loss**: Removing these columns will result in the permanent loss of any data stored in the `created_at` and `updated_at` columns of the `card_collisions` table.
