## High-level description
This SQL migration script is designed to revert the changes made in the corresponding `up.sql` file. It removes the `created_at` and `updated_at` columns from the `card_collisions` table in the database.

### SQL ALTER TABLE Statement
#### Description
This SQL statement modifies the structure of the `card_collisions` table by removing two columns.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `ALTER TABLE` command is used to modify the `card_collisions` table.
2. Two `DROP COLUMN` clauses are used to remove the `created_at` and `updated_at` columns from the table.

## Side Effects
- This migration will permanently remove the `created_at` and `updated_at` columns from the `card_collisions` table.
- Any data stored in these columns will be lost when this migration is executed.
- Applications or queries that rely on these columns will need to be updated to avoid errors.

## Performance Considerations
- Dropping columns is generally a fast operation, but it may take longer if the table contains a large amount of data.
- This operation may briefly lock the table, potentially affecting concurrent operations on the `card_collisions` table.

## TODOs
The comment at the top of the file, `-- This file should undo anything in `up.sql``, serves as a reminder and documentation of the purpose of this migration script. It indicates that this `down.sql` script is intended to reverse the changes made by the corresponding `up.sql` script.
