## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for adding and removing `created_at` and `updated_at` columns to the `card_collisions` table in a database. The migration is dated 2023-06-23 and is identified by the timestamp 002015. These scripts are typically used in database version control systems to manage schema changes over time.

## What does it do?
The migration scripts in this directory perform the following actions:

1. The "up" migration (`up.sql`):
   - Adds two new columns to the `card_collisions` table: `created_at` and `updated_at`.
   - Both columns are of type TIMESTAMP and are set to NOT NULL with a default value of the current timestamp (NOW()).

2. The "down" migration (`down.sql`):
   - Removes the `created_at` and `updated_at` columns from the `card_collisions` table.

These scripts allow developers to track when card collision records are created and last updated, and also provide the ability to revert these changes if needed.

## Key Files

### up.sql
This file contains the SQL commands to add the new columns:

```sql
ALTER TABLE card_collisions
ADD COLUMN created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
ADD COLUMN updated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW();
```

This script modifies the `card_collisions` table by adding two new columns:
- `created_at`: Stores the timestamp when a record is created.
- `updated_at`: Stores the timestamp when a record is last updated.

Both columns are set to NOT NULL, ensuring they always have a value, and DEFAULT NOW() sets them to the current timestamp when a new record is inserted.

### down.sql
This file contains the SQL commands to remove the added columns:

```sql
ALTER TABLE card_collisions
DROP COLUMN created_at,
DROP COLUMN updated_at;
```

This script reverts the changes made by `up.sql` by removing the `created_at` and `updated_at` columns from the `card_collisions` table.

## Configuration
The migration is identified by its timestamp in the directory name: `2023-06-23-002015`. This naming convention is likely used by the migration system to determine the order in which migrations should be applied or rolled back.

## Dependencies
These migration scripts assume the existence of a `card_collisions` table in the database. They also rely on the database system supporting standard SQL ALTER TABLE commands and the TIMESTAMP data type.

## Side Effects
It's important to note that running the down migration (`down.sql`) will result in the permanent loss of any data stored in the `created_at` and `updated_at` columns of the `card_collisions` table. This should be considered carefully before executing the down migration in any environment, especially in production.
