## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for creating and managing the `card_metadata` and `card_votes` tables in a database. These tables are designed to store information about cards and user votes on those cards, likely as part of a larger application that deals with card-based content and user interactions.

## What does it do?
The migration scripts in this directory set up a database structure to handle card-related data and user voting. Here's a breakdown of what it accomplishes:

1. Creates a `card_metadata` table to store information about cards, including their content, associated links, authors, and references to external search indexes.
2. Creates a `card_votes` table to record user votes on specific cards, allowing for upvotes and downvotes.
3. Establishes relationships between cards, their authors, and the users who vote on them.
4. Sets up indexes to optimize database queries related to card metadata and votes.
5. Provides a way to revert these changes if needed, through the down migration script.

This database structure enables the application to manage card content, track authorship, associate cards with external search capabilities (likely for similarity searches), and record user voting patterns on cards.

## Key Files

### up.sql
This file contains the SQL commands to create the database structure. It defines two main tables:

1. `card_metadata`: Stores information about individual cards.
   - Columns: `id`, `content`, `link`, `author_id`, `qdrant_point_id`, `created_at`, `updated_at`
   - Notable features:
     - Uses UUIDs for primary key and foreign key relationships
     - Includes a `qdrant_point_id` column, likely for integration with a Qdrant vector database for similarity search
     - Tracks creation and update timestamps

2. `card_votes`: Records user votes on cards.
   - Columns: `id`, `voted_user_id`, `card_metadata_id`, `vote`, `created_at`, `updated_at`
   - Notable features:
     - Links votes to both users and card metadata
     - Uses a boolean `vote` column to represent upvotes (true) and downvotes (false)

The script also creates indexes to optimize query performance:
- `idx_card_metadata_author_id`
- `idx_card_metadata_qdrant_point_id`
- `idx_card_votes_voted_user_id`
- `idx_card_votes_card_metadata_id`

### down.sql
This file contains the SQL commands to revert the changes made by `up.sql`. It simply drops the `card_votes` and `card_metadata` tables if they exist. This allows for easy rollback of the migration if needed.

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS card_votes;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS card_metadata;
```

## Dependencies
While not explicitly stated, the use of UUID data types and the overall structure suggests that this migration is designed for a PostgreSQL database. The integration with Qdrant (as implied by the `qdrant_point_id` column) indicates a dependency on a vector database system for advanced search capabilities.

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration files in this directory. However, the migration scripts themselves serve as a form of configuration for the database schema. Key configurable aspects include:

1. Table names: `card_metadata` and `card_votes`
2. Column names and data types
3. Foreign key relationships
4. Index names and the columns they cover

Developers working with this codebase should be aware of these schema details when interacting with the database or making future modifications.

In conclusion, this migration sets up a robust database structure for managing card content and user voting in an application. It provides a foundation for storing card information, tracking authorship, integrating with external search systems, and recording user interactions through votes. The use of indexes and proper foreign key relationships ensures efficient querying and data integrity.
