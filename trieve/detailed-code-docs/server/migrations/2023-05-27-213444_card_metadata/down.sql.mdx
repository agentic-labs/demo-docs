title: "down.sql"

## High-level description
This SQL script defines the down migration for the "card_metadata" migration. It's responsible for reverting the database changes introduced by the corresponding `up.sql` script. The main functionality is to drop the `card_votes` and `card_metadata` tables if they exist.

## Symbols

### `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS card_votes`
#### Description
This statement attempts to drop the table named `card_votes` only if it exists in the database. This ensures that the script doesn't fail if the table is already absent.

#### Internal Logic
- It uses the `DROP TABLE` SQL statement to remove the table.
- The `IF EXISTS` clause makes the operation conditional, preventing errors if the table doesn't exist.

### `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS card_metadata`
#### Description
Similar to the previous statement, this one attempts to drop the table named `card_metadata` if it exists.

#### Internal Logic
- It uses the `DROP TABLE` SQL statement to remove the table.
- The `IF EXISTS` clause makes the operation conditional, preventing errors if the table doesn't exist.
