## High-level description
This SQL script defines a database migration that reverts the changes introduced by the `up.sql` migration file. Specifically, it drops the `card_votes` and `card_metadata` tables if they exist.

## Symbols
### `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS`
#### Description
This SQL statement attempts to drop a table only if it exists. This prevents errors if the table is not present in the database.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| table_name | string | The name of the table to be dropped. |

#### Internal Logic
1. **Check for existence:** The database checks if the specified table exists.
2. **Conditional drop:** If the table exists, it is dropped. If not, the statement does nothing.

#### Side Effects
- **Data loss:** If the tables exist, this statement will permanently delete them and all associated data.

### `card_votes`
#### Description
This symbol represents the name of a table that is being dropped. The table likely stored information about votes related to cards.

### `card_metadata`
#### Description
This symbol represents the name of a table that is being dropped. The table likely stored metadata associated with cards.
