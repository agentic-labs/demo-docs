## High-level description
This SQL script creates two tables, `card_metadata` and `card_votes`, in a database to store information about cards and user votes on those cards. It also creates indexes to optimize query performance.

## Code Structure
The code defines two tables: `card_metadata` and `card_votes`. The `card_metadata` table stores the main information about a card, including its content, link, author, and a reference to a Qdrant point. The `card_votes` table stores information about user votes on cards, linking back to the `card_metadata` table. Both tables have indexes created for their foreign key relationships to improve query performance.

## Symbols

### `card_metadata`
#### Description
This table stores metadata information about cards.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a table definition, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a table definition, not a function.

#### Internal Logic
The table has the following columns:
- `id`: UUID primary key for the card metadata.
- `content`: Text content of the card, marked as NOT NULL.
- `link`: Optional text field for storing a link related to the card.
- `author_id`: UUID foreign key referencing the `users` table, representing the author of the card. This field is NOT NULL.
- `qdrant_point_id`: UUID referencing a point in a Qdrant index, likely related to the card's content for similarity search. This field is NOT NULL.
- `created_at`: Timestamp indicating the creation time of the record, defaults to the current timestamp.
- `updated_at`: Timestamp indicating the last update time of the record, defaults to the current timestamp.

### `idx_card_metadata_author_id`
#### Description
This index speeds up queries that filter or join on the `author_id` column of the `card_metadata` table.

### `idx_card_metadata_qdrant_point_id`
#### Description
This index speeds up queries that filter or join on the `qdrant_point_id` column of the `card_metadata` table.

### `card_votes`
#### Description
This table stores information about user votes on cards.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a table definition, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a table definition, not a function.

#### Internal Logic
The table has the following columns:
- `id`: UUID primary key for the vote record.
- `voted_user_id`: UUID foreign key referencing the `users` table, representing the user who cast the vote. This field is NOT NULL.
- `card_metadata_id`: UUID foreign key referencing the `card_metadata` table, indicating which card the vote is for. This field is NOT NULL.
- `vote`: Boolean value representing the vote (true for upvote, false for downvote). This field is NOT NULL.
- `created_at`: Timestamp indicating the creation time of the vote record, defaults to the current timestamp.
- `updated_at`: Timestamp indicating the last update time of the vote record, defaults to the current timestamp.

### `idx_card_votes_voted_user_id`
#### Description
This index speeds up queries that filter or join on the `voted_user_id` column of the `card_votes` table.

### `idx_card_votes_card_metadata_id`
#### Description
This index speeds up queries that filter or join on the `card_metadata_id` column of the `card_votes` table.

## References
- `users` table (referenced by `author_id` in `card_metadata` and `voted_user_id` in `card_votes`)

## Dependencies
This code likely depends on a PostgreSQL database as it uses UUIDs as primary keys.
