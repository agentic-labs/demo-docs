## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for creating and dropping indexes on two notification-related tables: `file_upload_completed_notifications` and `verification_notifications`. The purpose of these migrations is to improve query performance for these tables by adding indexes on specific columns that are likely to be frequently used in WHERE clauses or JOIN operations.

## What does it do?
The migration scripts in this directory perform the following actions:

1. In the "up" migration (`up.sql`):
   - Creates indexes on the `user_uuid` and `collection_uuid` columns of the `file_upload_completed_notifications` table.
   - Creates indexes on the `user_uuid`, `card_uuid`, and `verification_uuid` columns of the `verification_notifications` table.

2. In the "down" migration (`down.sql`):
   - Drops all the indexes created in the "up" migration, effectively reverting the database schema to its previous state.

These actions are designed to optimize database performance for queries that frequently filter or join on these columns. By adding indexes, the database can more quickly locate the relevant rows without having to scan the entire table. This is particularly useful for large tables where full table scans would be time-consuming.

## Key Files

### up.sql
This file contains the SQL commands to create the new indexes. Here's a breakdown of what it does:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_file_upload_completed_notifications_user_uuid ON file_upload_completed_notifications (user_uuid);
CREATE INDEX idx_file_upload_completed_notifications_collection_uuid ON file_upload_completed_notifications (collection_uuid);
CREATE INDEX idx_verification_notifications_user_uuid ON verification_notifications (user_uuid);
CREATE INDEX idx_verification_notifications_card_uuid ON verification_notifications (card_uuid);
CREATE INDEX idx_verification_notifications_verification_uuid ON verification_notifications (verification_uuid);
```

Each `CREATE INDEX` statement creates a new index on a specific column of a table. The index names are descriptive, indicating the table and column they're indexing.

### down.sql
This file contains the SQL commands to drop the indexes created by `up.sql`. It's used when rolling back the migration:

```sql
DROP INDEX idx_file_upload_completed_notifications_user_uuid;
DROP INDEX idx_file_upload_completed_notifications_collection_uuid;
DROP INDEX idx_verification_notifications_user_uuid;
DROP INDEX idx_verification_notifications_card_uuid;
DROP INDEX idx_verification_notifications_verification_uuid;
```

Each `DROP INDEX` statement removes the corresponding index created in the `up.sql` file.

## Dependencies
This migration doesn't directly depend on any external libraries or frameworks. However, it assumes the existence of a database migration system that can execute these SQL scripts in the appropriate order and track which migrations have been applied.

## Configuration
There are no specific configuration files or environment variables used in these migration scripts. However, the database connection details (host, port, database name, etc.) would typically be configured in the application that runs these migrations.

It's important to note that while adding indexes can significantly improve query performance, they also have some trade-offs:

1. Indexes take up additional disk space.
2. Write operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) may become slightly slower as indexes need to be updated.
3. If the indexed columns are frequently updated, the performance gain might be less significant.

Therefore, the decision to add these indexes should be based on the specific query patterns and performance requirements of the application. Regular monitoring and performance testing should be conducted to ensure these indexes are providing the expected benefits.
