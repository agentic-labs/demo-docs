## High-level description
This SQL script reverts database schema changes related to indexes that were likely created in an "up" migration. It specifically targets indexes on two tables: `file_upload_completed_notifications` and `verification_notifications`.

## Symbols
### `down.sql`
#### Description
This script drops indexes previously created on the `file_upload_completed_notifications` and `verification_notifications` tables. This is typically used when rolling back a database migration.

#### Internal Logic
The script performs the following actions:

1. **Drops indexes for `file_upload_completed_notifications` table:**
   - `DROP INDEX idx_file_upload_completed_notifications_user_uuid;`: Removes an index likely used for querying notifications by user.
   - `DROP INDEX idx_file_upload_completed_notifications_collection_uuid;`: Removes an index likely used for querying notifications by collection.

2. **Drops indexes for `verification_notifications` table:**
   - `DROP INDEX idx_verification_notifications_user_uuid;`: Removes an index likely used for querying notifications by user.
   - `DROP INDEX idx_verification_notifications_card_uuid;`: Removes an index likely used for querying notifications by card.
   - `DROP INDEX idx_verification_notifications_verification_uuid;`: Removes an index likely used for querying notifications by verification.

#### Side Effects
- **Removes database indexes:** This can lead to slower query performance for queries that relied on these indexes.
- **Irreversible operation:** Dropping indexes cannot be undone with a simple rollback. If the indexes are needed again, they have to be recreated.
