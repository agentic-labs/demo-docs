## High-level description
This SQL script reverts database schema changes related to indexes that were likely introduced in a migration named `2023-08-06-060606_notifications-indexes`. It specifically drops indexes from two tables: `file_upload_completed_notifications` and `verification_notifications`.

## Symbols

### `DROP INDEX`
#### Description
This SQL statement is used to delete existing indexes from tables. It's important for undoing schema changes, especially during migration rollbacks.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| index_name | string | The name of the index to be dropped. |

#### Side Effects
- **Removes an index:** This operation directly modifies the database schema by deleting the specified index.
- **Impacts Performance:** Dropping indexes can affect the performance of queries that previously benefited from them.

#### Performance Considerations
Dropping indexes can be a relatively quick operation, but it's crucial to consider the potential performance impact on queries that rely on those indexes.

### `idx_file_upload_completed_notifications_user_uuid`, `idx_file_upload_completed_notifications_collection_uuid`, `idx_verification_notifications_user_uuid`, `idx_verification_notifications_card_uuid`, `idx_verification_notifications_verification_uuid`
#### Description
These are the names of the indexes being dropped from the `file_upload_completed_notifications` and `verification_notifications` tables. The naming suggests that these indexes likely sped up queries based on:
- **`user_uuid`**:  Probably a foreign key referencing a user table.
- **`collection_uuid`**: Likely a foreign key referencing a collection table.
- **`card_uuid`**:  Probably a foreign key referencing a card table.
- **`verification_uuid`**: Likely a foreign key referencing a verification table.
