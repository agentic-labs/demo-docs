## High-level description
This SQL script is a database migration rollback script. It aims to revert a change made by the corresponding `up.sql` script, specifically adding back the `content` column to the `chunk_metadata` table.

## Symbols

### `ALTER TABLE chunk_metadata ADD COLUMN content text;`
#### Description
This SQL statement modifies the existing `chunk_metadata` table by adding a new column named `content` of type `text`.

#### Internal Logic
- **`ALTER TABLE chunk_metadata`**: This part specifies that the table named `chunk_metadata` is being modified.
- **`ADD COLUMN`**: This clause indicates that a new column is being added to the table.
- **`content text`**: This defines the name of the new column as `content` and its data type as `text`, which typically allows storing large amounts of textual data.
