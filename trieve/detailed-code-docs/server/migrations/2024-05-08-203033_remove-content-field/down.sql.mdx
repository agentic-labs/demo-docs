title: "down.sql"
---

## High-level description
This SQL script reverts a database migration by adding back the `content` column to the `chunk_metadata` table. This suggests that the `up.sql` migration likely removed this column, and this "down" migration is designed to undo that change.

## Symbols

### `ALTER TABLE chunk_metadata ADD COLUMN content text;`
#### Description
This SQL statement modifies the existing `chunk_metadata` table by adding a new column named `content` with the data type `text`. 

#### Internal Logic
- **`ALTER TABLE chunk_metadata`**: This part specifies that the table named `chunk_metadata` is being modified.
- **`ADD COLUMN`**: This indicates that a new column is being added to the table.
- **`content text`**: This defines the name of the new column as `content` and sets its data type to `text`, allowing it to store large textual content.
