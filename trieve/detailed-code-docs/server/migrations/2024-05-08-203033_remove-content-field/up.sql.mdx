## High-level description
This SQL script defines an up migration that removes the `content` column from the `chunk_metadata` table. This migration is likely part of a larger schema change and suggests that the content itself is being moved to a different location or managed differently. 

## Symbols

### `ALTER TABLE chunk_metadata DROP COLUMN content;`
#### Description
This SQL statement removes the `content` column from the `chunk_metadata` table. 

#### Internal Logic
* **`ALTER TABLE chunk_metadata`**: This part of the statement specifies that the `chunk_metadata` table is being modified.
* **`DROP COLUMN content`**: This part instructs the database to remove the column named `content`. 

#### Side Effects
This migration will result in the permanent removal of the `content` column and any data stored within it from the `chunk_metadata` table.
