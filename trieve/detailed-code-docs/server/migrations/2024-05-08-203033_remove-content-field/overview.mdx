## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for a database schema change, specifically the removal of the 'content' field from the 'chunk_metadata' table. The migration is dated 2024-05-08 and is identified by the timestamp 203033.

## What does it do?
These migration scripts modify the structure of the 'chunk_metadata' table in the database. The 'up' migration removes the 'content' column from the table, while the 'down' migration adds it back. This allows for easy application and reversal of the database schema change.

The removal of the 'content' field suggests a change in how data is stored or processed in the application. It could be part of an optimization process, a shift in data storage strategy, or a response to changing requirements.

## Key Files

1. `up.sql`:
   This file contains the SQL command to remove the 'content' column from the 'chunk_metadata' table. When executed, it will permanently delete the 'content' column and all its data.

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE chunk_metadata DROP COLUMN content;
   ```

2. `down.sql`:
   This file contains the SQL command to add back the 'content' column to the 'chunk_metadata' table. It's used to revert the changes made by the 'up' migration.

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE chunk_metadata ADD COLUMN content text;
   ```

These files work together to provide a reversible database migration. The 'up.sql' script is run to apply the change, while the 'down.sql' script can be run to undo the change if necessary.

## Configuration
The migration is identified by its timestamp (2024-05-08-203033) in the directory name. This naming convention is likely used by a migration tool to determine the order in which migrations should be applied or rolled back.

No additional configuration files are present in this directory. The migration scripts are straightforward SQL commands that directly modify the database schema.
