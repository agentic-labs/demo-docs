### `ALTER TABLE stripe_plans`
#### Description
This SQL statement modifies the existing "stripe_plans" table by adding a new column.

#### Internal Logic
- `ALTER TABLE`: This clause initiates the modification of an existing table.
- `stripe_plans`: This is the name of the table to be modified.
- `ADD COLUMN name TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT ''`: This part of the statement defines the new column being added:
    - `ADD COLUMN`: Specifies that a new column is being added.
    - `name`: The name of the new column.
    - `TEXT`: The data type of the new column, allowing for text strings.
    - `NOT NULL`:  A constraint ensuring that the column cannot have a null value.
    - `DEFAULT ''`: Sets an empty string as the default value for the column if no value is provided during insertion.
