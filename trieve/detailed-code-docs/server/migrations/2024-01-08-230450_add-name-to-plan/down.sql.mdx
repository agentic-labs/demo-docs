title: "down.sql"

## High-level description
This SQL script is a database migration file that reverts a change made to the `stripe_plans` table. Specifically, it removes the `name` column that was presumably added in the corresponding `up.sql` migration file.

## Symbols

### `ALTER TABLE stripe_plans DROP COLUMN name;`
#### Description
This SQL statement removes the `name` column from the `stripe_plans` table.

#### Internal Logic
- **`ALTER TABLE stripe_plans`**: This clause initiates a change to the structure of the table named `stripe_plans`.
- **`DROP COLUMN name`**: This clause specifies that the action to be performed is the removal of a column named `name`.

#### Side Effects
- This operation directly modifies the schema of the `stripe_plans` table in the database.
- Any data previously stored in the `name` column will be permanently deleted.
