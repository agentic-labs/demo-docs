title: "down.sql"

## High-level description
This SQL script is a database migration file that reverts a schema change made to the `stripe_plans` table. Specifically, it removes the `name` column that was presumably added in the corresponding `up.sql` migration file.

## Symbols

### `ALTER TABLE stripe_plans DROP COLUMN name;`
#### Description
This SQL statement removes the `name` column from the `stripe_plans` table. This action is likely intended to reverse a previous migration that added this column.

#### Internal Logic
- **`ALTER TABLE stripe_plans`**: This clause specifies that the `stripe_plans` table is being modified.
- **`DROP COLUMN name`**: This clause instructs the database to remove the column named `name` from the table.

#### Side Effects
- **Data Loss**: Removing a column from a table results in the permanent loss of all data stored in that column. 

#### Performance Considerations
Dropping a column can be a time-consuming operation, especially for large tables. It's crucial to have appropriate backups and downtime planned before executing this migration in a production environment.
