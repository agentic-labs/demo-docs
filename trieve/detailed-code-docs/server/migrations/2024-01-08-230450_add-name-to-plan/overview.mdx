## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for adding a new `name` column to the `stripe_plans` table in a database. The migration is dated 2024-01-08 and includes both an "up" script to apply the change and a "down" script to revert it.

## What does it do?
These scripts modify the structure of the `stripe_plans` table in the database. The "up" migration adds a new column called `name` to store text information about each plan. This column is set to always require a value (it cannot be null) and will use an empty string as its default value if no specific name is provided when adding a new plan. The "down" migration does the opposite, removing the `name` column from the table, which would erase any plan names that had been stored.

## Key Files

1. `up.sql`:
   This file contains the SQL command to add the `name` column to the `stripe_plans` table. It's the script that will be run when applying this migration to update the database schema.

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE stripe_plans ADD COLUMN name TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT '';
   ```

2. `down.sql`:
   This file contains the SQL command to remove the `name` column from the `stripe_plans` table. It's used to revert the changes made by the `up.sql` script if needed.

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE stripe_plans DROP COLUMN name;
   ```

## Configuration
The migration is identified by its timestamp in the directory name: `2024-01-08-230450`. This naming convention is likely used by a database migration tool to determine the order in which migrations should be applied or reverted.

## Dependencies
While not explicitly stated, this migration likely depends on:
1. A database system that supports SQL ALTER TABLE statements (such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQLite).
2. A migration management tool (like Flyway, Liquibase, or a custom solution) that can execute these SQL scripts in the correct order.

## Performance Considerations
Adding a column to an existing table (as in `up.sql`) is generally a quick operation, even on large tables, as most database systems can do this without rewriting the entire table.

However, dropping a column (as in `down.sql`) can be more time-consuming, especially for large tables, as it may require rewriting the table data. It's important to consider potential downtime or performance impacts when planning to run this migration, particularly the "down" migration, on a production database with a large amount of data.

## Data Implications
- The `up.sql` script adds a new `name` column with a default value of an empty string. This means that after running the migration, all existing rows in the `stripe_plans` table will have an empty string in the `name` column.
- The `down.sql` script removes the `name` column entirely. This operation will result in the permanent loss of any data stored in the `name` column. It's crucial to ensure that this data is backed up or no longer needed before running the down migration.

## Best Practices
1. **Reversibility**: The migration follows the best practice of providing both "up" and "down" scripts, allowing for easy application and reversal of the schema change.
2. **Atomic Changes**: Each migration script performs a single, focused change to the database schema, making it easier to manage and troubleshoot.
3. **Default Value**: The `up.sql` script includes a default value for the new column, ensuring that existing rows in the table remain valid after the migration.
4. **NOT NULL Constraint**: By making the new column `NOT NULL`, the migration enforces data integrity, ensuring that all plans will have a name (even if it's an empty string).

In conclusion, this migration adds a crucial piece of information (the plan name) to the `stripe_plans` table, likely to improve the functionality or user experience of the application that uses this database. The scripts are straightforward and follow good practices for database migrations.
