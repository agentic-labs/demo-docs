## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration files for adding a new column named "name" to the "stripe_plans" table in a database. The migration consists of two files: an "up" script to apply the change and a "down" script to revert it.

## What does it do?
This migration adds a new feature to the database schema by introducing a "name" field to the stripe plans. This allows for a more descriptive identifier for each plan, in addition to any existing fields. The "name" field is set up as a required text field, ensuring that every plan will have a name associated with it. If no name is provided when creating or updating a plan, it will default to an empty string.

In case the change needs to be undone, the migration also provides a way to remove this new column, reverting the database schema to its previous state.

## Key Files

### up.sql
This file contains the SQL command to add the new "name" column to the "stripe_plans" table. The command is:

```sql
ALTER TABLE stripe_plans ADD COLUMN name TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT '';
```

This adds a TEXT column named "name" that cannot be null and defaults to an empty string if no value is provided.

### down.sql
This file contains the SQL command to remove the "name" column from the "stripe_plans" table if the migration needs to be reversed. The command is:

```sql
ALTER TABLE stripe_plans DROP COLUMN name;
```

This removes the "name" column and any data it contained from the "stripe_plans" table.

## Configuration
The migration is identified by its timestamp: 2024-01-08-230450. This timestamp ensures that migrations are applied in the correct order and helps in tracking when changes were made to the database schema.

No additional configuration is required for this migration. The SQL commands are straightforward and do not depend on any external variables or settings.

## Dependencies
This migration doesn't explicitly depend on any external libraries or frameworks. However, it assumes the existence of a "stripe_plans" table in the database, which is likely related to the Stripe payment processing service.

The migration is designed to work with a SQL database system that supports the ALTER TABLE command with ADD COLUMN and DROP COLUMN clauses. This is standard SQL syntax supported by most relational database management systems (RDBMS) such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite.

## Entry points
There are two main entry points for this migration:

1. up.sql: This is the file that should be executed when applying the migration to add the new "name" column.
2. down.sql: This file should be executed if the migration needs to be rolled back, removing the "name" column.

The order of execution is important:
- When updating the database schema, up.sql should be run.
- If a rollback is needed, down.sql should be run after up.sql has been applied.

These files are typically executed by a migration tool or framework that manages database schema changes. The tool would use the timestamp in the directory name to determine the order of execution relative to other migrations.
