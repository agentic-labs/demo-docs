## High-level description
This SQL migration file adds a new column called `current_period_end` to the `stripe_subscriptions` table. The new column is of type TIMESTAMP and allows NULL values, with a default value of NULL.

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE stripe_subscriptions
#### Description
This SQL command modifies the existing `stripe_subscriptions` table structure by adding a new column.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `ALTER TABLE` statement is used to modify the `stripe_subscriptions` table.
2. The `ADD COLUMN` clause specifies that a new column is being added to the table.
3. The new column is named `current_period_end`.
4. The data type of the new column is set to `TIMESTAMP`.
5. The `DEFAULT NULL` constraint allows the column to contain NULL values and sets the default value to NULL if no value is specified during insertion.

## Side Effects
- This migration will modify the structure of the `stripe_subscriptions` table in the database.
- Existing rows in the table will have NULL values in the new `current_period_end` column unless updated separately.
- Any applications or queries that interact with the `stripe_subscriptions` table will now have access to this new column.

## Performance Considerations
- Adding a new column to an existing table is generally a quick operation, especially when allowing NULL values and not setting a non-NULL default value.
- However, if the `stripe_subscriptions` table contains a large number of rows, this operation might take longer and could potentially lock the table during the migration.

## Dependencies
This migration assumes the existence of a `stripe_subscriptions` table in the database.

## Error Handling
The SQL statement does not include explicit error handling. If the `stripe_subscriptions` table doesn't exist or if a column with the same name already exists, the database system will likely raise an error, and the migration will fail.
