## High-level description
This SQL script adds a new column named `current_period_end` to the `stripe_subscriptions` table. This column is of type `TIMESTAMP` and defaults to `NULL`.

## Symbols

### `ALTER TABLE stripe_subscriptions`
#### Description
This statement modifies the existing `stripe_subscriptions` table to add a new column.

#### Internal Logic
- `ALTER TABLE`: This SQL command is used to modify the structure of an existing table.
- `stripe_subscriptions`: This is the name of the table that is being modified.
- `ADD COLUMN`: This clause specifies that a new column is being added to the table.
- `current_period_end`: This is the name of the new column being added.
- `TIMESTAMP`: This defines the data type of the new column as a timestamp, which stores date and time information.
- `DEFAULT NULL`: This sets the default value of the new column to `NULL`, meaning the column will be empty unless a value is explicitly provided.

## Side Effects
- The `stripe_subscriptions` table will be modified to include a new column named `current_period_end`.
