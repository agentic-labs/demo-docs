## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration files for adding a new column `current_period_end` to the `stripe_subscriptions` table in the database. The migration is dated 2023-12-15 and is identified by the timestamp 230134. It consists of two files: `up.sql` for applying the change and `down.sql` for reverting it.

## What does it do?
This migration modifies the structure of the `stripe_subscriptions` table in the database. It adds a new column called `current_period_end` which is designed to store the end date of the current subscription period. This column is of type TIMESTAMP and allows NULL values, with a default value of NULL. 

The purpose of this change is likely to track when each subscription's current period ends, which could be useful for billing purposes, subscription management, or reporting. By adding this information directly to the `stripe_subscriptions` table, it becomes easier to query and manage subscription periods without having to rely on external data or complex calculations.

The migration also provides a way to undo this change if needed, by removing the `current_period_end` column from the table.

## Key Files

1. `up.sql`: This file contains the SQL command to add the `current_period_end` column to the `stripe_subscriptions` table. Here's the content of the file:

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE stripe_subscriptions
   ADD COLUMN current_period_end TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NULL;
   ```

   This command modifies the `stripe_subscriptions` table by adding a new TIMESTAMP column named `current_period_end` with a default value of NULL.

2. `down.sql`: This file contains the SQL command to reverse the changes made by `up.sql`. Here's the content of the file:

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE stripe_subscriptions DROP COLUMN current_period_end;
   ```

   This command removes the `current_period_end` column from the `stripe_subscriptions` table, effectively undoing the change made by the `up.sql` migration.

## Dependencies
This migration depends on the existence of the `stripe_subscriptions` table in the database. It assumes that the table has already been created in a previous migration or as part of the initial database setup.

## Configuration
There are no specific configuration files or environment variables associated with this migration. The migration is designed to be run as part of a database migration process, typically managed by an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool or a custom migration system.

## Performance Considerations
While adding or dropping a column is generally a quick operation, especially when allowing NULL values and not setting a non-NULL default value, there are some performance considerations to keep in mind:

1. Table Size: If the `stripe_subscriptions` table contains a large number of rows, the migration might take longer to complete.

2. Table Locking: During the migration, the database might briefly lock the `stripe_subscriptions` table. This could potentially affect concurrent operations on this table.

3. Application Impact: After applying the `up.sql` migration, any applications or queries that interact with the `stripe_subscriptions` table will have access to the new `current_period_end` column. Conversely, after applying the `down.sql` migration, any code that relies on this column will no longer function correctly.

It's important to plan the execution of these migrations during a time of low database activity to minimize potential disruptions to the application's functionality.

In conclusion, this migration provides a straightforward way to add and remove a `current_period_end` column in the `stripe_subscriptions` table, allowing for better tracking and management of subscription periods in the application.
