## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for adding a new column `current_period_end` to the `stripe_subscriptions` table in a database. The migration is dated 2023-12-15 and includes both "up" and "down" scripts for applying and reverting the change, respectively.

## What does it do?
These migration scripts modify the structure of a database table related to Stripe subscriptions. The main actions are:

1. Adding a new column: The "up" script adds a `current_period_end` column to the `stripe_subscriptions` table. This column is designed to store the timestamp of when the current subscription period ends.

2. Removing the column: The "down" script removes the `current_period_end` column from the `stripe_subscriptions` table, effectively undoing the change made by the "up" script.

These scripts allow developers to manage database schema changes in a controlled and reversible manner, which is crucial for maintaining data integrity and application compatibility across different versions.

## Key Files

1. `up.sql`:
   This file contains the SQL command to add the `current_period_end` column to the `stripe_subscriptions` table. Here's the content of the file:

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE stripe_subscriptions
   ADD COLUMN current_period_end TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NULL;
   ```

   This script adds a new `TIMESTAMP` column named `current_period_end` with a default value of `NULL` to the `stripe_subscriptions` table.

2. `down.sql`:
   This file contains the SQL command to remove the `current_period_end` column from the `stripe_subscriptions` table. Here's the content of the file:

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE stripe_subscriptions
   DROP COLUMN current_period_end;
   ```

   This script removes the `current_period_end` column from the `stripe_subscriptions` table, effectively reverting the change made by the `up.sql` script.

## Configuration
The migration scripts don't require any specific configuration. However, the naming convention of the directory (2023-12-15-230134_add-current-period-end-to-stripe-subscriptions) suggests that this migration system likely uses timestamps in the directory name to order migrations. The timestamp 2023-12-15-230134 indicates that this migration was created on December 15, 2023, at 23:01:34.

## Side Effects
When applying these migrations:

1. Running the "up" migration:
   - Adds a new `current_period_end` column to the `stripe_subscriptions` table.
   - This new column will be of type `TIMESTAMP` and will default to `NULL` for existing rows.
   - Applications using this table will need to be updated to handle this new column.

2. Running the "down" migration:
   - Removes the `current_period_end` column from the `stripe_subscriptions` table.
   - Any data stored in this column will be permanently lost.
   - Applications that were using this column will need to be updated to handle its absence.

It's important to note that these migrations should be applied carefully, especially in production environments, as they involve structural changes to the database that could affect the application's functionality.
