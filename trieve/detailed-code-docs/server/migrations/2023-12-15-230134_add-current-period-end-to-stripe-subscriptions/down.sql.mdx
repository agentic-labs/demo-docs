## Symbols

### `ALTER TABLE ... DROP COLUMN`
#### Description
This SQL statement removes the `current_period_end` column from the `stripe_subscriptions` table. This action is intended to undo a previous migration that likely added this column.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a SQL statement, not a function with inputs.

#### Outputs
N/A - This statement modifies the database schema and doesn't return any output.

#### Internal Logic
1. **`ALTER TABLE stripe_subscriptions`**: This part specifies that the `stripe_subscriptions` table is being modified.
2. **`DROP COLUMN current_period_end`**: This part instructs the database to remove the column named `current_period_end`.

#### Side Effects
- **Schema Change**: The `stripe_subscriptions` table will no longer have the `current_period_end` column.
- **Data Loss**: Any data previously stored in the `current_period_end` column will be permanently deleted.
