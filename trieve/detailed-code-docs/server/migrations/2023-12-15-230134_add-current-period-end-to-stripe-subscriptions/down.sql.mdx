title: "down.sql"

## High-level description
This SQL migration file is designed to revert the changes made in the corresponding `up.sql` file. It removes the `current_period_end` column from the `stripe_subscriptions` table in the database.

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE stripe_subscriptions DROP COLUMN current_period_end
#### Description
This SQL statement removes the `current_period_end` column from the `stripe_subscriptions` table.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `ALTER TABLE` command is used to modify the structure of an existing table.
2. `stripe_subscriptions` is the target table being altered.
3. `DROP COLUMN` is used to remove a column from the table.
4. `current_period_end` is the name of the column being removed.

## Side Effects
- This migration will permanently remove the `current_period_end` column and all its data from the `stripe_subscriptions` table.
- Any queries or application code that relies on the `current_period_end` column will no longer function correctly after this migration is applied.

## Performance Considerations
- Dropping a column is generally a fast operation, but it may take longer if the table contains a large number of rows.
- This operation may briefly lock the table, potentially affecting concurrent operations on the `stripe_subscriptions` table.

## TODOs
The comment at the top of the file, `-- This file should undo anything in `up.sql``, serves as a reminder and guideline for the purpose of this migration file. It ensures that this `down.sql` file correctly reverses the changes made in the corresponding `up.sql` file.
