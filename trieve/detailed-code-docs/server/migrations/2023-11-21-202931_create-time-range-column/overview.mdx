## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for adding and removing a `time_stamp` column to the `card_metadata` and `files` tables in a database. The migration is dated 2023-11-21, indicating when it was created or intended to be applied.

## What does it do?
These migration scripts modify the structure of two database tables:

1. `card_metadata`
2. `files`

The `up.sql` script adds a new column called `time_stamp` to both tables. This column is of type `TIMESTAMP` and allows NULL values, with a default value of NULL. This means that when new rows are added to these tables, they can optionally include a timestamp, but if no value is provided, it will be set to NULL.

The `down.sql` script does the opposite - it removes the `time_stamp` column from both tables. This script is used to revert the changes made by the `up.sql` script if needed.

These changes allow the application to store and manage timestamp information for entries in the `card_metadata` and `files` tables, which could be used for tracking when records were created, modified, or for any other time-related purpose specific to the application's needs.

## Key Files

1. `up.sql`: This file contains the SQL commands to add the `time_stamp` column to the `card_metadata` and `files` tables. Here's what it does:

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE card_metadata ADD COLUMN time_stamp TIMESTAMP NULL DEFAULT NULL;
   ALTER TABLE files ADD COLUMN time_stamp TIMESTAMP NULL DEFAULT NULL;
   ```

   These commands add a new `time_stamp` column to each table, allowing NULL values and setting the default to NULL.

2. `down.sql`: This file contains the SQL commands to remove the `time_stamp` column from the `card_metadata` and `files` tables. Here's what it does:

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE card_metadata DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS time_stamp;
   ALTER TABLE files DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS time_stamp;
   ```

   These commands remove the `time_stamp` column from each table if it exists. The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the operation doesn't fail if the column is not present.

Both scripts are designed to be idempotent, meaning they can be run multiple times without causing errors or unintended side effects. This is achieved through the use of `IF EXISTS` in the `down.sql` script.

## Configuration
The migration is identified by its timestamp: `2023-11-21-202931`. This timestamp is likely used by a database migration tool to track which migrations have been applied and in what order. The format suggests that this migration was created on November 21, 2023, at 20:29:31 (8:29:31 PM).

When applying database migrations, it's important to consider the following:

1. The order of migrations: Ensure that this migration is applied in the correct sequence relative to other migrations.
2. Database compatibility: Verify that the `TIMESTAMP` data type is supported by the database system in use.
3. Application code: After applying this migration, any application code that interacts with the `card_metadata` or `files` tables should be updated to handle the new `time_stamp` column appropriately.
4. Data consistency: Consider whether existing rows in the tables should have their `time_stamp` values populated, or if it's acceptable for them to remain NULL.

By providing both `up.sql` and `down.sql` scripts, this migration allows for easy application and rollback of the database changes, which is crucial for maintaining database schema versions and facilitating smooth deployments and potential rollbacks in a production environment.
