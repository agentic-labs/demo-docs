## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for implementing and managing user collection counts in a database. It includes two files: `up.sql` for applying the changes and `down.sql` for rolling them back. The migration creates a new table to store user collection counts, implements a trigger to keep these counts updated, and provides a mechanism to backfill existing data.

## What does it do?
The migration accomplishes the following:

1. Creates a new table called `user_collection_counts` to store the number of collections each user has.
2. Implements a trigger function `update_collection_counts()` that automatically updates the collection counts whenever changes occur in the `card_collection` table.
3. Sets up a trigger `update_collection_counts_trigger` on the `card_collection` table to call the update function.
4. Backfills the `user_collection_counts` table with existing data from the `card_collection` table.
5. Provides a rollback mechanism to undo these changes if needed.

This migration allows the system to efficiently track and query the number of collections each user has without the need for expensive count operations on the `card_collection` table every time this information is needed.

## Key Files

### up.sql
This file contains the SQL commands to apply the migration. It performs the following actions:

1. Creates the `user_collection_counts` table with columns for id, user_id, and collection_count.
2. Defines the `update_collection_counts()` function, which is responsible for maintaining accurate collection counts.
3. Creates the `update_collection_counts_trigger` on the `card_collection` table.
4. Backfills the `user_collection_counts` table with existing data.

Here's a snippet of the table creation:

```sql
CREATE TABLE user_collection_counts (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),
    collection_count INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0
);
```

And a part of the trigger function:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_collection_counts() RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
    IF (TG_OP = 'INSERT') THEN
        INSERT INTO user_collection_counts (user_id, collection_count)
        VALUES (NEW.author_id, 1)
        ON CONFLICT (user_id) DO UPDATE SET collection_count = user_collection_counts.collection_count + 1;
    ELSIF (TG_OP = 'DELETE') THEN
        UPDATE user_collection_counts
        SET collection_count = collection_count - 1
        WHERE user_id = OLD.author_id;
    END IF;
    RETURN NULL;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

### down.sql
This file contains the SQL commands to roll back the migration. It performs the following actions:

1. Drops the `update_collection_counts_trigger` from the `card_collection` table.
2. Drops the `update_collection_counts()` function.
3. Drops the `user_collection_counts` table.

Here's the content of `down.sql`:

```sql
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS update_collection_counts_trigger ON card_collection;
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS update_collection_counts();
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS user_collection_counts;
```

## Configuration
This migration doesn't require any specific configuration files or environment variables. However, it assumes the existence of a `users` table and a `card_collection` table in the database. The `users` table should have an `id` column of type UUID, and the `card_collection` table should have an `author_id` column referencing the `users` table.

## Dependencies
This migration relies on PostgreSQL-specific features:

1. The `uuid_generate_v4()` function for generating UUIDs.
2. PL/pgSQL for writing the trigger function.

While no specific version is mentioned, these features are available in PostgreSQL 9.4 and later versions.

In conclusion, this migration implements an efficient way to track user collection counts, providing both performance benefits and data integrity through the use of triggers and a dedicated table for storing the counts.
