## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for transitioning from a "collection" based model to a "group" based model in the database schema. The migration involves renaming tables and columns, as well as updating a function to work with the new terminology. The directory includes both "up" and "down" migration scripts to allow for applying and reverting the changes.

## What does it do?
The migration scripts in this directory perform the following tasks:

1. Rename several database tables, replacing "collection" with "group" in their names. For example, "chunk_collection" becomes "chunk_group".
2. Rename columns in various tables, again replacing "collection" with "group" in their names. For instance, "collection_uuid" becomes "group_uuid" in the "file_upload_completed_notifications" table.
3. Add a unique constraint to the "dataset_group_counts" table to ensure each dataset has only one count record.
4. Update a trigger function that maintains group counts, replacing the old "update_collection_counts" function with a new version that works with the "group" terminology.

These changes effectively restructure the database to use "groups" as the primary organizational unit for chunks of data, instead of "collections". The "down" migration script allows for reverting these changes if needed, restoring the original "collection" based structure.

## Key Files

1. `up.sql`: This file contains the SQL commands to apply the migration, transitioning from "collections" to "groups".

   Key operations:
   - Renames tables (e.g., `chunk_collection` to `chunk_group`)
   - Renames columns (e.g., `collection_uuid` to `group_uuid`)
   - Adds a unique constraint to `dataset_group_counts`
   - Replaces the `update_collection_counts` function with an updated version

   Example of table renaming:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE chunk_collection RENAME TO chunk_group;
   ```

   Example of function update:
   ```sql
   CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_collection_counts()
   RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
   BEGIN
     IF (TG_OP = 'INSERT' OR TG_OP = 'UPDATE') THEN
       INSERT INTO dataset_group_counts (dataset_id, group_count)
       VALUES (NEW.dataset_id, 1)
       ON CONFLICT (dataset_id) DO UPDATE SET group_count = dataset_group_counts.group_count + 1;
     ELSIF (TG_OP = 'DELETE') THEN
       UPDATE dataset_group_counts
       SET group_count = group_count - 1
       WHERE dataset_id = OLD.dataset_id;
     END IF;
     RETURN NULL;
   END;
   $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
   ```

2. `down.sql`: This file contains the SQL commands to revert the migration, changing back from "groups" to "collections".

   Key operations:
   - Renames tables and columns back to their original "collection" names
   - Implicitly removes the unique constraint (by renaming the table)

   Example of reverting table names:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE chunk_group RENAME TO chunk_collection;
   ```

## Dependencies
The migration scripts rely on the PostgreSQL database system, as evidenced by the use of PostgreSQL-specific SQL syntax and the `plpgsql` language for the trigger function. The exact version of PostgreSQL is not specified in the provided files, but it should be compatible with relatively recent versions that support these features.

## Configuration
These migration scripts do not require explicit configuration. However, they assume a specific initial state of the database and expect certain tables and columns to exist. The migration process typically relies on a migration framework or tool (such as Diesel for Rust projects) to manage the execution of these scripts in the correct order and track which migrations have been applied.

It's crucial to note that applying these migrations will change the database schema, potentially breaking existing application code that relies on the old "collection" naming convention. Therefore, corresponding updates to the application code should be made in conjunction with applying these database migrations to ensure continued functionality.
