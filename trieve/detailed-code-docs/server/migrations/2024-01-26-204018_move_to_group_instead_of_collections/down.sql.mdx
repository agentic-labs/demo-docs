## High-level description
This SQL script is designed to revert the changes made in a previous migration that moved from collections to groups. It renames tables and columns to restore the original "collection" naming convention, effectively undoing the transition to "group" terminology.

### SQL Commands

#### Description
The script consists of a series of SQL ALTER TABLE statements that rename tables and columns. Each statement is designed to revert a specific change made in the corresponding 'up' migration.

#### Internal Logic
1. Rename `chunk_group` table back to `chunk_collection`
2. Rename `chunk_group_bookmarks` table back to `chunk_collection_bookmarks`
3. Rename `groups_from_files` table back to `collections_from_files`
4. In `file_upload_completed_notifications` table, rename `group_uuid` column to `collection_uuid`
5. In `collections_from_files` table, rename `group_id` column to `collection_id`
6. In `chunk_collection_bookmarks` table, rename `group_id` column to `collection_id`
7. Rename `dataset_group_counts` table to `dataset_collection_counts`
8. In `dataset_collection_counts` table, rename `group_count` column to `collection_count`

## Side Effects
Executing this script will modify the database schema, reverting table and column names from "group" terminology back to "collection" terminology. This may affect any application code or queries that rely on the current "group" naming convention.

## Dependencies
This script depends on the existence of the tables and columns it's attempting to rename. It assumes that the 'up' migration has been previously applied to create the "group" named tables and columns.

## Error Handling
The script does not include explicit error handling. If any of the tables or columns do not exist as expected, the SQL commands will fail, potentially leaving the database in an inconsistent state.

## TODOs
The comment at the top of the file, "-- This file should undo anything in `up.sql`", suggests that this script is intended to be a complete reversal of a corresponding 'up' migration. Developers should verify that all changes in the 'up' migration are indeed undone by this script.
