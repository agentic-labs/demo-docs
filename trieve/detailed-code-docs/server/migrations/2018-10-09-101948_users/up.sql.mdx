## High-level description
This SQL script creates a new table named `users` in the database. The table is intended to store user data, including a unique ID, email, password hash, and timestamps for creation and last update.

## Symbols
### `users`
#### Description
This SQL statement creates a new table named `users` with the specified columns.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a SQL statement, not a function, so it doesn't take explicit inputs.

#### Outputs
N/A - This statement creates a table as a side effect within the database.

#### Internal Logic
- `CREATE TABLE users`: This line initiates the creation of a new table named "users".
- `id UUID NOT NULL UNIQUE PRIMARY KEY`: Defines the "id" column as a UUID (Universally Unique Identifier). It's set as the primary key, ensuring each entry has a unique identifier. `NOT NULL` enforces that this column cannot be empty.
- `email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL UNIQUE`: Creates the "email" column, which can store up to 100 characters. It's also set to be `NOT NULL` and `UNIQUE`, ensuring every user has a valid and distinct email address.
- `hash VARCHAR(122) NOT NULL`: Defines the "hash" column for storing password hashes (likely using Argon2, as indicated by the comment). It allows up to 122 characters and cannot be empty.
- `created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL`: This column stores the timestamp when a user record is created. It uses the `TIMESTAMP` data type and is set to `NOT NULL`.
- `updated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL`: Similar to `created_at`, this column stores the timestamp of the last update to a user record, also using `TIMESTAMP` and set to `NOT NULL`.

## Side Effects
- **Creates a new table:** This script, when executed, will create a new table named `users` in the database schema. 

## Dependencies
This script depends on the SQL database system to understand and execute the SQL commands. The specific dialect of SQL (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) might influence the data types and constraints used.
