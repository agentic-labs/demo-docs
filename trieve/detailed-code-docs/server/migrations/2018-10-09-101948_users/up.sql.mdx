## High-level description
This SQL script creates a new table named `users` in the database. The table is designed to store user information, including a unique ID, email, password hash, and timestamps for creation and last update.

## Symbols
### `users`
#### Description
This symbol represents a SQL table named `users`. It stores information about users.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a table definition, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a table definition, not a function.

#### Internal Logic
The table schema is defined with the following columns:

- `id`: A universally unique identifier (UUID) that serves as the primary key for each user. It is marked as `NOT NULL` and `UNIQUE` to ensure data integrity.
- `email`: A string field to store the user's email address. It has a maximum length of 100 characters and is marked as both `NOT NULL` and `UNIQUE`, enforcing that each email address in the table is unique.
- `hash`: A string field designed to store the hash of the user's password. It has a fixed length of 122 characters, likely chosen to accommodate the output of the Argon2 hashing algorithm. The field is marked as `NOT NULL`, requiring a password hash for each user.
- `created_at`: A timestamp field recording when the user record was created in the database. It is set to `NOT NULL`, ensuring that every user entry has a creation timestamp.
- `updated_at`: A timestamp field that tracks when the user record was last modified. Like `created_at`, it is also set to `NOT NULL`, guaranteeing that each user entry has a record of its last update time.
