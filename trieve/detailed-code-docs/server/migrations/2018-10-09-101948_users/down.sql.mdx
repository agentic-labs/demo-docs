## High-level description
This SQL script contains instructions for rolling back a database migration related to the `users` table. It ensures that the database schema is reverted to its state before the migration in `up.sql` was applied.

## Symbols

### `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS users;`
#### Description
This SQL statement attempts to drop the `users` table from the database. The `IF EXISTS` clause makes the operation conditional: the table will only be dropped if it already exists. This prevents errors if the table doesn't exist, making the script more robust.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Check for existence:** The database checks if a table named `users` exists.
2. **Conditional drop:**
   - If the `users` table exists, it is permanently deleted, along with all its data and associated indexes.
   - If the `users` table doesn't exist, the statement completes without any action.
