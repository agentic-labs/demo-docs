## High-level description
This SQL script defines the "down" migration for the "users" table. It's designed to reverse the changes introduced by the corresponding "up" migration. In this case, it simply drops the "users" table if it exists.

## Symbols

### `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS users;`
#### Description
This SQL statement attempts to drop the "users" table. The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the statement won't fail if the table doesn't exist. This is crucial for a "down" migration, as it might be executed in a scenario where the "up" migration was not fully completed.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Check for existence:** The database checks if a table named "users" exists.
2. **Conditional drop:**
   - If the "users" table exists, it's dropped, deleting the table and all its data.
   - If the "users" table doesn't exist, the statement completes without taking any action.

#### Side Effects
- **Data loss:** If the "users" table exists, this statement will delete it and all associated data. This operation is irreversible.
