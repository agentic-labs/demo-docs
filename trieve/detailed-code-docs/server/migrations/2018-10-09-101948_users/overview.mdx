## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for creating and managing the `users` table in the database. It includes two files: `up.sql` for creating the table and `down.sql` for rolling back the changes.

## What does it do?
These migration scripts handle the creation and deletion of the `users` table in the database. The `up.sql` script sets up a new table to store user information, including unique identifiers, email addresses, password hashes, and timestamps for creation and updates. The `down.sql` script provides a way to undo these changes by dropping the `users` table if it exists.

## Key Files

### up.sql
This file contains the SQL commands to create the `users` table. It defines the structure of the table with the following columns:

- `id`: A unique identifier for each user (UUID)
- `email`: The user's email address (up to 100 characters)
- `hash`: A hashed version of the user's password (122 characters)
- `created_at`: Timestamp of when the user record was created
- `updated_at`: Timestamp of when the user record was last updated

All fields are set as `NOT NULL`, ensuring that every user record has complete information. The `id` and `email` fields are also marked as `UNIQUE` to prevent duplicate entries.

### down.sql
This file contains a single SQL command to drop the `users` table if it exists. This allows for easy rollback of the migration if needed.

## Configuration
The migration scripts use SQL syntax compatible with PostgreSQL. The specific configuration of the database connection is not included in these files and would typically be managed elsewhere in the application.

Here's an example of the `up.sql` content:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id UUID NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  hash CHAR(122) NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
);
```

And the content of `down.sql`:

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS users;
```

These migration scripts are crucial for maintaining the database schema and ensuring that all instances of the application are using the same structure for the `users` table. The use of separate `up` and `down` scripts allows for easy application and reversal of database changes, which is particularly useful in development and deployment workflows.
