## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for creating and managing the "users" table in the database. It includes two files: an "up" migration script to create the table and a "down" migration script to remove it. These scripts are part of a database migration system, likely used to manage database schema changes over time.

## What does it do?
The migration scripts in this directory handle the creation and deletion of a "users" table in the database. Here's a simple explanation of what each script does:

1. The "up" script creates a new table called "users" that stores information about users of the system. This table includes fields for:
   - A unique user ID
   - The user's email address
   - A hashed version of the user's password (for security)
   - The date and time when the user account was created
   - The date and time when the user account was last updated

2. The "down" script does the opposite - it removes the "users" table from the database. This is useful if you need to undo the changes made by the "up" script.

These scripts allow developers to easily set up the user data structure in the database or remove it if needed, ensuring that all instances of the application have a consistent database structure.

## Key Files

1. `up.sql`: This file contains the SQL commands to create the "users" table.

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE users (
     id UUID NOT NULL UNIQUE PRIMARY KEY,
     email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
     hash VARCHAR(122) NOT NULL,
     created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
     updated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL
   );
   ```

   This script creates a table with columns for user ID (as a UUID), email, password hash, and timestamps for creation and last update. The use of `NOT NULL` and `UNIQUE` constraints ensures data integrity.

2. `down.sql`: This file contains the SQL command to remove the "users" table.

   ```sql
   DROP TABLE IF EXISTS users;
   ```

   This script simply drops the "users" table if it exists, effectively undoing the changes made by the "up" script.

## Configuration
The migration scripts don't use any external configuration files or environment variables. However, the naming convention of the directory (`2018-10-09-101948_users`) suggests that this migration was created on October 9, 2018, at 10:19:48. This timestamp is likely used by the migration system to determine the order in which migrations should be applied.

The choice of data types and constraints in the `up.sql` script implies some configuration decisions:

1. User IDs are stored as UUIDs, which provides a globally unique identifier for each user.
2. Email addresses are limited to 100 characters and must be unique across all users.
3. Password hashes are stored in a field that allows up to 122 characters, which is likely chosen to accommodate the output of a specific hashing algorithm (possibly Argon2, as suggested by a comment in the original summary).
4. Timestamps are used to track when user records are created and updated.

These choices reflect decisions about data storage, user identification, and security practices in the application. Developers working with this schema should be aware of these constraints when implementing user management features.
