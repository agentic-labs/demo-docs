## High-level description
This SQL script creates a new table named `card_verification` in the database. This table is designed to store information about the verification of cards, likely relating to their similarity to other cards in the system.

## Code Structure
The code consists of a single SQL statement that defines the structure of the `card_verification` table. It specifies the columns, their data types, and constraints.

## References
- **`card_metadata` table:** The `card_id` column references the `id` column of the `card_metadata` table, establishing a foreign key relationship. This suggests that each card verification is associated with a specific card in the `card_metadata` table.

## Symbols
### `card_verification` table
#### Description
This table stores data related to the verification of cards, specifically their similarity scores compared to other cards.

#### Columns
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `id` | `UUID` | Primary key of the table, uniquely identifying each verification record. |
| `card_id` | `UUID` | Foreign key referencing the `id` of the card in the `card_metadata` table. This links the verification to a specific card. |
| `similarity_score` | `BigInt` |  A numerical score representing the similarity of the card to other cards. The higher the score, the more similar the card is to others. |


## Dependencies
This code depends on the existence of the `card_metadata` table, as indicated by the foreign key constraint.
