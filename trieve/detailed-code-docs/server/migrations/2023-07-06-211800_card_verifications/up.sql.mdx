## High-level description
This SQL script defines a database migration that creates a new table named `card_verification`. This table is designed to store information about the verification of cards, likely related to some form of image similarity check, as indicated by the `similarity_score` column. 

## Code Structure
The code consists of a single SQL `CREATE TABLE` statement that defines the structure of the `card_verification` table.

## Symbols
### `CREATE TABLE card_verification`
#### Description
This SQL statement creates a new table named `card_verification` to store card verification data.

#### Internal Logic
The statement defines the following columns for the table:

- `id`: A UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) that serves as the primary key for the table, ensuring each row has a unique identifier.
- `card_id`: A UUID that references the `id` column of the `card_metadata` table, establishing a foreign key relationship. This suggests that each card verification is associated with a specific card's metadata.
- `similarity_score`: A `BigInt` (large integer) value representing the similarity score, likely indicating the degree of match during a verification process. The `NOT NULL` constraint enforces that this field must always have a value.

## References
- `card_metadata`: The `card_id` column references the `id` column of this table, implying a relationship between card verification and card metadata.
