## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for creating and dropping a `card_verification` table in the database. The migration is dated 2023-07-06-211800, indicating when it was created or last modified. These scripts are part of a database versioning system, allowing for controlled changes to the database schema over time.

## What does it do?
The migration scripts in this directory perform two main functions:

1. Creating a new table: The "up" migration creates a `card_verification` table. This table is designed to store information about the verification of cards, specifically their similarity to other cards in the system. Each record in this table represents a verification entry for a specific card, including a similarity score.

2. Removing the table: The "down" migration provides a way to undo the changes made by the "up" migration. It drops the `card_verification` table, effectively removing it from the database schema.

These scripts allow developers to easily apply or revert changes to the database structure, ensuring consistency across different environments and facilitating collaborative development.

## Key Files

1. `up.sql`: This file contains the SQL commands to create the `card_verification` table. It defines the structure of the table, including its columns and constraints.

2. `down.sql`: This file contains the SQL command to drop the `card_verification` table, effectively undoing the changes made by the `up.sql` script.

Let's look at each file in more detail:

### up.sql

This script creates the `card_verification` table with the following structure:

```sql
CREATE TABLE card_verification (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    card_id UUID NOT NULL,
    similarity_score BigInt NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (card_id) REFERENCES card_metadata(id)
);
```

The table has three columns:
- `id`: A UUID that serves as the primary key for the table.
- `card_id`: A UUID that references the `id` column in the `card_metadata` table, establishing a relationship between the two tables.
- `similarity_score`: A BigInt value representing the similarity of the card to other cards in the system.

The `FOREIGN KEY` constraint ensures that each `card_id` in the `card_verification` table corresponds to a valid `id` in the `card_metadata` table, maintaining referential integrity.

### down.sql

This script contains a single command to drop the `card_verification` table:

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS card_verification;
```

The `IF EXISTS` clause is used to prevent errors if the table doesn't exist when the script is run.

## Dependencies
The `up.sql` script depends on the existence of a `card_metadata` table, as it references this table in its foreign key constraint. This implies that the `card_metadata` table should be created before this migration is applied.

## Configuration
These migration scripts don't require any specific configuration. However, they are typically executed by a database migration tool or framework (such as Diesel for Rust, or Flyway for Java) that manages the order and execution of migrations. The naming convention of the directory (2023-07-06-211800_card_verifications) suggests that this migration system uses timestamps to order migrations.

In conclusion, this directory contains a simple but important database migration for adding and removing a `card_verification` table. This table appears to be part of a larger system for managing and verifying cards, possibly in a game or collectible card application. The migration scripts provide a controlled way to evolve the database schema, allowing for easy application and rollback of changes during development and deployment processes.
