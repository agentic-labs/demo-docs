## High-level description
This SQL script handles the database migration to remove the `card_verification` table. This is typically used during development or rollback scenarios.

## Symbols

### `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS card_verification`
#### Description
This SQL statement attempts to drop the table named `card_verification` only if it exists. This prevents errors if the table has already been dropped.

#### Internal Logic
1. **`DROP TABLE`**: This command is used to remove a table from the database.
2. **`IF EXISTS`**: This clause checks for the existence of the table before attempting to drop it.
3. **`card_verification`**: This is the name of the table to be dropped.

#### Side Effects
- **Data Loss**: If the `card_verification` table exists, this statement will permanently delete the table and all its data.
