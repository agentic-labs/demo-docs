## Symbols

### `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS card_verification`
#### Description
This SQL statement attempts to drop the `card_verification` table from the database. The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the operation doesn't fail if the table doesn't exist.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Check for Existence:** The database checks if a table named `card_verification` exists.
2. **Drop Table:** If the table exists, it's permanently deleted along with all its data.
3. **No Action:** If the table doesn't exist, no action is taken.
