## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for creating and dropping the `cut_cards` table in the database. It consists of two files: `up.sql` for creating the table and `down.sql` for dropping it. These migrations are part of a database versioning system, allowing for controlled schema changes and easy rollbacks if needed.

## What does it do?
The migration scripts in this directory manage the lifecycle of the `cut_cards` table in the database. Here's what they do in simple terms:

1. The `up.sql` script creates a new table called `cut_cards`. This table is designed to store information about cut cards, which are likely some form of user-generated content or data associated with users. Each cut card has a unique identifier, is linked to a specific user, contains some text content, and keeps track of when it was created and last updated.

2. The `down.sql` script does the opposite. It removes the `cut_cards` table from the database entirely. This is useful if you need to undo the changes made by the `up.sql` script, effectively erasing all cut card data from the database.

These scripts allow developers to easily add or remove the `cut_cards` feature from the database, ensuring that the database structure can be consistently updated or rolled back across different environments (like development, testing, and production).

## Key Files

1. `up.sql`: This file contains the SQL commands to create the `cut_cards` table. It defines the structure of the table, including columns for id, user_id, content, and timestamps. It also sets up a foreign key relationship with the `users` table.

2. `down.sql`: This file contains the SQL command to drop the `cut_cards` table, effectively removing it and all its data from the database.

## Dependencies
The migration scripts rely on PostgreSQL, as evidenced by the PostgreSQL-specific syntax used in the `up.sql` file (such as the `UUID` data type and the `NOW()` function).

## Configuration
These migration scripts don't require any specific configuration. However, they assume the existence of a `users` table in the database, as the `cut_cards` table references it through a foreign key constraint.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the `cut_cards` table structure as defined in `up.sql`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE cut_cards (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users (id),
    cut_card_content TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

- `id`: A unique identifier for each cut card, using UUID (Universally Unique Identifier).
- `user_id`: Links each cut card to a user in the `users` table. This is a foreign key constraint.
- `cut_card_content`: The actual content of the cut card, stored as text.
- `created_at`: Timestamp of when the cut card was created, automatically set to the current time.
- `updated_at`: Timestamp of when the cut card was last updated, initially set to the creation time.

This structure allows for efficient storage and retrieval of cut cards, with built-in user association and timestamp tracking for auditing purposes.
