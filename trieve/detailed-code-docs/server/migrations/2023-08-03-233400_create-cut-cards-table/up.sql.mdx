## High-level description
This SQL script creates a table named `cut_cards` in the database. This table is designed to store information about cut cards, including their content and a reference to the user who created them.

## References
- `users` table: The `user_id` column references the `id` column in the `users` table, establishing a foreign key relationship.

## Symbols
### `CREATE TABLE cut_cards`
#### Description
This SQL statement creates a new table named `cut_cards` with the specified columns.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a SQL statement, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a SQL statement, not a function.

#### Internal Logic
The statement defines the following columns for the `cut_cards` table:

- `id`: A universally unique identifier (UUID) that serves as the primary key for the table, ensuring each cut card has a unique identifier.
- `user_id`: A UUID representing the user who created the cut card. This column is a foreign key referencing the `id` column of the `users` table, enforcing referential integrity.
- `cut_card_content`: A text field to store the actual content of the cut card. This field is not nullable, meaning each cut card must have content.
- `created_at`: A timestamp field that automatically records the date and time when a cut card record is created. It defaults to the current timestamp.
- `updated_at`: A timestamp field that automatically updates to the current timestamp whenever the cut card record is modified. It also defaults to the current timestamp upon creation.
