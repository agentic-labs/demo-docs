## High-level description
This SQL script creates a table named `cut_cards` in the database. This table is designed to store information about cut cards associated with users, including their content and timestamps.

## References
This script references the `users` table through the `user_id` foreign key constraint.

## Symbols
### `CREATE TABLE cut_cards`
#### Description
This SQL statement defines a new table named `cut_cards` with specific columns and constraints.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a SQL statement, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This statement creates a table as a side effect.

#### Internal Logic
1. **`CREATE TABLE cut_cards`**: This line initiates the creation of a new table named `cut_cards`.
2. **`id UUID PRIMARY KEY`**: Defines the `id` column as a UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) and sets it as the primary key for the table. This ensures each cut card has a unique identifier.
3. **`user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users (id)`**: Defines the `user_id` column as a UUID, makes it mandatory (NOT NULL), and establishes a foreign key constraint referencing the `id` column of the `users` table. This enforces referential integrity, ensuring every cut card is associated with an existing user.
4. **`cut_card_content TEXT NOT NULL`**: Defines the `cut_card_content` column as TEXT, making it mandatory. This column likely stores the actual content of the cut card.
5. **`created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()`**: Defines the `created_at` column as a timestamp, makes it mandatory, and sets its default value to the current timestamp. This automatically records when a cut card is created.
6. **`updated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()`**: Defines the `updated_at` column as a timestamp, makes it mandatory, and sets its default value to the current timestamp. This automatically tracks the last time a cut card was updated.

## Side Effects
- **Table Creation**: This script creates a new table named `cut_cards` in the database.
- **Foreign Key Constraint**: It establishes a relationship between the `cut_cards` table and the `users` table through the `user_id` foreign key.

## Dependencies
- **PostgreSQL**: This script uses PostgreSQL syntax for table and column definitions.

## Error Handling
N/A - This script does not include explicit error handling. Standard SQL error handling mechanisms would apply.
