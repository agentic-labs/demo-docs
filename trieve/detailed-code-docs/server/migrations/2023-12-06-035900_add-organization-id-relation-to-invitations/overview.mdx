## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for modifying the `invitations` table in a database. The migration adds an `organization_id` column with a foreign key constraint to the `organizations` table and removes the `referral_tokens` column. It also includes a corresponding down migration to revert these changes.

## What does it do?
The migration scripts in this directory perform the following actions:

1. In the "up" migration:
   - Add a new column called `organization_id` to the `invitations` table. This column is of type UUID and cannot contain null values.
   - Create a foreign key constraint linking the `organization_id` column in the `invitations` table to the `id` column in the `organizations` table.
   - Remove the `referral_tokens` column from the `invitations` table.

2. In the "down" migration:
   - Remove the `organization_id` column from the `invitations` table.
   - Add back the `referral_tokens` column to the `invitations` table as a TEXT field.

These changes effectively modify the structure of the `invitations` table to establish a direct relationship with the `organizations` table through the `organization_id` column, while removing the previously used `referral_tokens` column.

## Key Files

### up.sql
This file contains the SQL commands to apply the migration:

```sql
ALTER TABLE invitations ADD COLUMN organization_id UUID NOT NULL;
ALTER TABLE invitations ADD CONSTRAINT invitations_organization_id_fkey FOREIGN KEY (organization_id) REFERENCES organizations(id);
ALTER TABLE invitations DROP COLUMN referral_tokens;
```

These commands add the `organization_id` column, create a foreign key constraint, and remove the `referral_tokens` column.

### down.sql
This file contains the SQL commands to revert the migration:

```sql
ALTER TABLE invitations DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS organization_id;
ALTER TABLE invitations ADD COLUMN referral_tokens TEXT;
```

These commands remove the `organization_id` column and add back the `referral_tokens` column.

## Configuration
The migration is identified by its timestamp: `2023-12-06-035900`. This timestamp is used to order migrations and ensure they are applied in the correct sequence.

No additional configuration is required for these migration scripts. They are designed to be run by a database migration tool that supports up and down migrations.
