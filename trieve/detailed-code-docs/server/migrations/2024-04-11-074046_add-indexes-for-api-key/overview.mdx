## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for adding and removing indexes on the `user_api_key` table in a database. The migration is dated 2024-04-11 and focuses on improving query performance for API key-related operations.

## What does it do?
The migration scripts in this directory perform the following actions:

1. In the "up" migration:
   - Create an index on the `api_key_hash` column of the `user_api_key` table.
   - Create an index on the `blake3_hash` column of the `user_api_key` table.

2. In the "down" migration:
   - Remove the index on the `api_key_hash` column.
   - Remove the index on the `blake3_hash` column.

These changes are designed to improve the speed of database queries that search for API keys using either the `api_key_hash` or `blake3_hash` values. By adding indexes, the database can more quickly locate the relevant rows without having to scan the entire table.

## Key Files

### up.sql
This file contains the SQL commands to create the new indexes:

```sql
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS user_api_key_api_key_hash_index ON user_api_key (api_key_hash);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS user_api_key_blake3_hash_index ON user_api_key (blake3_hash);
```

The `IF NOT EXISTS` clause ensures that the operation is idempotent, meaning it can be safely run multiple times without causing errors or duplicate indexes.

### down.sql
This file contains the SQL commands to remove the indexes created by the up migration:

```sql
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS user_api_key_api_key_hash_index;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS user_api_key_blake3_hash_index;
```

Again, the `IF EXISTS` clause makes these operations safe to run multiple times, as they will only attempt to drop the indexes if they exist.

## Configuration
The migration is identified by its timestamp: 2024-04-11-074046. This naming convention is likely used by a database migration tool to track which migrations have been applied and in what order.

The migration assumes the existence of a `user_api_key` table with columns `api_key_hash` and `blake3_hash`. The specific database system is not explicitly mentioned, but the SQL syntax is compatible with common relational database management systems like PostgreSQL or MySQL.
