## High-level description
This SQL migration script alters the `card_collisions` table by modifying the `collision_qdrant_id` column to allow NULL values. This change makes the column optional, potentially accommodating scenarios where a collision_qdrant_id might not be available or applicable.

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE card_collisions ALTER COLUMN collision_qdrant_id DROP NOT NULL
#### Description
This SQL statement modifies the structure of the `card_collisions` table by changing the `collision_qdrant_id` column to allow NULL values.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `ALTER TABLE` command is used to modify an existing table structure.
2. `card_collisions` is the target table being altered.
3. `ALTER COLUMN collision_qdrant_id` specifies the column to be modified.
4. `DROP NOT NULL` removes the NOT NULL constraint from the column, allowing it to accept NULL values.

## Side Effects
- After this migration is applied, the `collision_qdrant_id` column in the `card_collisions` table will be able to store NULL values.
- Existing data in the table will not be affected, but future inserts or updates can now include NULL for this column.
- Any application logic or queries that assumed this column always had a value may need to be updated to handle potential NULL values.

## Performance Considerations
This alteration is typically a metadata operation and should be relatively quick to execute. However, on large tables or busy systems, it may briefly lock the table during the operation.

## Dependencies
This migration script relies on the existence of:
1. The `card_collisions` table
2. The `collision_qdrant_id` column within that table

Note: The specific database system is not explicitly mentioned, but this SQL syntax is compatible with PostgreSQL and several other major database systems.
