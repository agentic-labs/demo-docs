## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for modifying the `card_collisions` table in a database. The migration specifically targets the `collision_qdrant_id` column, making it nullable. This change allows the column to accept NULL values, which was previously not allowed.

## What does it do?
The migration scripts in this directory perform a database schema change on the `card_collisions` table. Here's a simple explanation of what happens:

1. The "up" migration (when applying the change):
   - It modifies the `collision_qdrant_id` column in the `card_collisions` table.
   - It removes the requirement that this column must always have a value (removes the NOT NULL constraint).
   - After this change, it's okay for some rows in the table to have no value (NULL) for this column.

2. The "down" migration (when reverting the change):
   - It does the opposite of the "up" migration.
   - It adds back the requirement that the `collision_qdrant_id` column must always have a value (adds the NOT NULL constraint).
   - This ensures that if you need to undo the change, the database goes back to its previous state where every row must have a value for this column.

This type of change might be done to make the database more flexible, allowing for situations where the `collision_qdrant_id` might not be available or applicable for some records.

## Key Files

1. `up.sql`:
   - This file contains the SQL command to make the `collision_qdrant_id` column nullable.
   - The command used is:
     ```sql
     ALTER TABLE card_collisions ALTER COLUMN collision_qdrant_id DROP NOT NULL;
     ```
   - This script is run when applying the migration, moving the database schema forward.

2. `down.sql`:
   - This file contains the SQL command to revert the change, making the `collision_qdrant_id` column non-nullable again.
   - The command used is:
     ```sql
     ALTER TABLE card_collisions ALTER COLUMN collision_qdrant_id SET NOT NULL;
     ```
   - This script is run when rolling back the migration, returning the database schema to its previous state.

Both files are crucial for maintaining the ability to apply and revert this specific database change. They work together to ensure that the database can be updated or rolled back as needed, maintaining data integrity and consistency throughout the process.
