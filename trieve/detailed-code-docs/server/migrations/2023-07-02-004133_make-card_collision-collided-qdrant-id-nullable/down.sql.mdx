## High-level description
This SQL script reverts a database migration by modifying the `card_collisions` table. It specifically makes the `collision_qdrant_id` column non-nullable, effectively undoing a previous change that likely made it nullable.

## Symbols

### `ALTER TABLE card_collisions ALTER COLUMN collision_qdrant_id DROP NOT NULL`
#### Description
This SQL statement modifies the `collision_qdrant_id` column within the `card_collisions` table. It removes the `NOT NULL` constraint, making the column able to store `NULL` values.

#### Internal Logic
1. **`ALTER TABLE card_collisions`**: This part targets the `card_collisions` table for modification.
2. **`ALTER COLUMN collision_qdrant_id`**: This specifies that the operation will be performed on the `collision_qdrant_id` column.
3. **`DROP NOT NULL`**: This removes the `NOT NULL` constraint from the column, allowing it to accept `NULL` values.
