## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for a database update related to notification count fixes. The migration is identified by the timestamp 2023-08-08-025725 and is named "notification_count_fix". It consists of two files: `up.sql` for applying the migration and `down.sql` for reverting it.

## What does it do?
The migration introduces an automated system to manage unread notification counts for users in a database. Here's a simplified explanation of what it does:

1. When a new notification is created for a user, the system automatically increases the count of unread notifications for that user by one.
2. When a notification is deleted, the system automatically decreases the count of unread notifications for the associated user by one.
3. This counting happens automatically in the background, so the application doesn't need to manually keep track of these counts.

This system ensures that the count of unread notifications for each user is always up-to-date without requiring manual intervention from the application code.

## Key Files

### up.sql
This file contains the SQL commands to implement the notification count fix. It defines a PostgreSQL function `update_notification_count()` that manages the count of unread notifications for each user. The function is designed to be triggered automatically when notifications are inserted or deleted.

Key aspects of the `update_notification_count()` function:
- It uses PostgreSQL's trigger variables (`TG_OP`, `NEW`, and `OLD`) to determine whether a notification is being inserted or deleted.
- For insertions, it either creates a new entry in the `user_notification_counts` table with a count of 1 or increments an existing count.
- For deletions, it decrements the notification count for the associated user.

The function is likely attached to a trigger on the notifications table (though the trigger creation is not shown in this file).

### down.sql
This file is intended to contain SQL commands to revert the changes made by `up.sql`. However, the file is currently incomplete and only contains a comment indicating its purpose. The actual reversion SQL commands need to be added to make this migration fully reversible.

## Configuration
This migration doesn't involve any explicit configuration files or environment variables. However, it assumes the existence of certain database structures:

1. A table named `user_notification_counts` with columns:
   - `user_uuid` (likely the primary key)
   - `notification_count` (an integer field to store the count)

2. A notifications table (not explicitly named in the provided code) that this trigger function will be associated with. This table is expected to have a `user_uuid` column to identify the user associated with each notification.

## Dependencies
This migration relies on PostgreSQL-specific features:

1. Trigger functions: The code uses PostgreSQL's trigger function capabilities.
2. `ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` clause: This is a PostgreSQL-specific feature for handling upserts (insert or update operations).

The exact version of PostgreSQL required is not specified, but these features are available in PostgreSQL 9.5 and later versions.

## Error Handling
The migration doesn't implement explicit error handling beyond what's provided by PostgreSQL. Potential errors that could occur include:

1. Table or column not found errors if the assumed database structure doesn't exist.
2. Data type mismatch errors if the `user_uuid` or `notification_count` columns are not of the expected types.

It's important to ensure that the database schema matches the assumptions made in this migration before applying it.

## Performance Considerations
The use of a trigger function for maintaining the notification count offers good performance characteristics:

1. Counts are updated automatically with each relevant database operation, eliminating the need for separate update queries.
2. The `ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` clause optimizes the insert operation by updating in place if a row already exists, avoiding unnecessary insertions.

However, if the system handles a very high volume of notifications, the additional overhead of the trigger function on each insert and delete operation should be considered and monitored.
