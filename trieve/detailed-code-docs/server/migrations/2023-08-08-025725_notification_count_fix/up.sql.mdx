## High-level description
This SQL script defines a PostgreSQL function `update_notification_count()` that automatically manages the count of unread notifications for each user in a system. It leverages triggers to increment the count upon notification insertion and decrement upon deletion.

## Symbols

### `update_notification_count()`
#### Description
This function is a PostgreSQL trigger function designed to keep the `user_notification_counts` table updated whenever a notification is added or removed from the system. It utilizes the special trigger variables `TG_OP`, `NEW`, and `OLD` to determine the operation (insert or delete) and access the relevant data.

#### Inputs
This function implicitly receives data from the triggers, it does not have explicit input parameters.

*   **`TG_OP` (Trigger Variable)**: A string indicating the triggering operation ('INSERT' or 'DELETE').
*   **`NEW` (Trigger Variable)**: A record representing the new row being inserted (available for 'INSERT' operations).
*   **`OLD` (Trigger Variable)**: A record representing the old row being deleted (available for 'DELETE' operations).

#### Outputs
This function uses `RETURN NEW` for 'INSERT' operations, which signifies that the trigger should continue with the insertion. For 'DELETE', there's no explicit return value as the trigger's action is a side effect.

#### Internal Logic
1.  **Operation Check:** It first checks the value of `TG_OP` to determine if it's an 'INSERT' or 'DELETE' operation.
2.  **INSERT Case:** If it's an 'INSERT', it attempts to insert a new row into `user_notification_counts` with an initial count of 1. If a row for the user already exists, it increments the existing `notification_count` by 1 using `ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE`.
3.  **DELETE Case:** If it's a 'DELETE', it decrements the `notification_count` in `user_notification_counts` for the corresponding `user_uuid`.

## Side Effects
*   **Modifies `user_notification_counts` table:** This function directly updates the `notification_count` for users in the `user_notification_counts` table based on notification insertions and deletions.

## Error Handling
The code does not implement specific error handling beyond the built-in mechanisms of PostgreSQL. For instance, if the `user_notification_counts` table or columns do not exist, the function would throw an error.

## Performance Considerations
*   **Trigger Efficiency:** Using triggers ensures that the notification count is updated automatically with each relevant database operation, potentially offering better performance than manual updates.
*   **`ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE`:** This clause optimizes the insert operation by updating the count in place if a row for the user already exists, preventing unnecessary rows.
