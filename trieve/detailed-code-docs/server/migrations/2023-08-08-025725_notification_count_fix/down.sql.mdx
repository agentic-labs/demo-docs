title: "down.sql"

## High-level description
This SQL file reverts the database migration defined in the corresponding `up.sql` file within the same directory. The purpose of this specific migration, `2023-08-08-025725_notification_count_fix`, is not clear from this file alone and would be found in the `up.sql` file.

## Code Structure
This file contains a single SQL comment indicating its purpose. The actual SQL commands to revert the migration would be present below the comment.

## Symbols
There are no significant symbols in this file as it's expected to contain raw SQL commands.

## Side Effects
The SQL commands within this file will directly modify the database schema or data to undo the changes made by the `up.sql` file.

## TODOs
- This file is incomplete and requires the actual SQL commands to revert the migration implemented in the corresponding `up.sql` file.
