## Code Structure

### SQL Comment
#### Description
The comment `-- This file should undo anything in `up.sql`` serves as a placeholder and instruction for the developer. It indicates that this file should contain SQL statements to reverse the changes made in the corresponding `up.sql` file.

## Side Effects
As there is no actual SQL code in this file, there are no side effects when executed. However, the lack of reversal SQL statements means that running this migration will not undo any changes made by the corresponding `up.sql` file.

## TODOs
While not explicitly stated, the empty content of this file implies that there is a task to be completed:

1. Implement the necessary SQL statements to undo the changes made in the corresponding `up.sql` file related to the notification count fix.

It's important for the development team to fill in this file with the appropriate SQL commands to ensure proper version control and reversibility of database changes.
