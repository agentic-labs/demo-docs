title: "down.sql"

## High-level description
This SQL migration file is designed to undo the changes made by the corresponding `up.sql` file. It drops the `stripe_invoices` table from the database, effectively removing all data and structure related to Stripe invoices.

## Symbols

### DROP TABLE stripe_invoices;
#### Description
This SQL command removes the `stripe_invoices` table from the database schema.

#### Internal Logic
The `DROP TABLE` statement is used to completely remove a table and all its associated data from the database. In this case, it's targeting the `stripe_invoices` table.

## Side Effects
- Permanent deletion of the `stripe_invoices` table and all its contents.
- Any dependencies on this table (e.g., foreign key constraints, views, or triggers) will be affected and may cause errors if not handled properly.

## Performance Considerations
Dropping a table is generally a fast operation, but the time it takes can depend on the size of the table and any associated indexes or constraints. For large tables, this operation might temporarily lock database resources.

## Error Handling
This SQL command does not include explicit error handling. If the `stripe_invoices` table doesn't exist when this migration is run, it will likely result in an SQL error.

## TODOs
The comment at the top of the file suggests that this migration should undo anything done in the corresponding `up.sql` file. It's important to ensure that this `down.sql` file correctly reverses all changes made in the `up.sql` file to maintain database integrity during migrations.
