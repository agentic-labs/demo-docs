## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for modifying the `datasets` table in a database. The migration is specifically focused on removing the `client_configuration` column from the `datasets` table. The directory includes two SQL files: `up.sql` for applying the change and `down.sql` for reverting it.

## What does it do?
This migration performs a structural change to the database by removing a column that was previously used to store client configuration data. Here's a breakdown of the process:

1. When the migration is applied (using the `up.sql` script):
   - The `client_configuration` column is removed from the `datasets` table.
   - Any data stored in this column will be permanently deleted.

2. If the migration needs to be reverted (using the `down.sql` script):
   - A new `client_configuration` column is added back to the `datasets` table.
   - The new column is set to store JSON data (using the `jsonb` data type in PostgreSQL).

This migration likely reflects a change in how the application handles client configuration data. Perhaps this data is being moved to a separate table or is no longer needed in the database at all.

## Key Files

1. `up.sql`:
   - This file contains the SQL command to drop the `client_configuration` column from the `datasets` table.
   - The command used is: 
     ```sql
     ALTER TABLE datasets DROP COLUMN client_configuration;
     ```
   - When executed, this will permanently remove the column and all data it contains.

2. `down.sql`:
   - This file contains the SQL command to add the `client_configuration` column back to the `datasets` table if the migration needs to be reversed.
   - The command used is:
     ```sql
     ALTER TABLE datasets ADD COLUMN client_configuration jsonb;
     ```
   - This will create a new `client_configuration` column with the `jsonb` data type, which is used for storing JSON data in PostgreSQL.

It's important to note that while the `down.sql` script can add the column back, it cannot restore any data that was in the column before it was dropped. If data recovery is necessary, it should be handled separately from this migration.

## Configuration
The migration is identified by its timestamp: `2024-07-02-042424`. This timestamp is likely used by the migration tool to track which migrations have been applied and in what order.

No additional configuration appears to be required for this migration. However, the database connection details and migration tool configuration would typically be specified elsewhere in the project.
