## High-level description
This SQL script defines an "up" migration that drops the `client_configuration` column from the `datasets` table. This migration is likely part of a larger schema change related to how client configuration is handled within the application.

## Symbols
### `ALTER TABLE datasets DROP COLUMN client_configuration;`
#### Description
This SQL statement removes the `client_configuration` column from the `datasets` table. 

#### Internal Logic
- **`ALTER TABLE datasets`**: This clause initiates an alteration to the existing `datasets` table.
- **`DROP COLUMN client_configuration`**: This clause specifies that the action to be performed is dropping (removing) a column named `client_configuration`.

#### Side Effects
- **Data Loss**:  All data previously stored in the `client_configuration` column will be permanently deleted. 
- **Schema Change**: The structure of the `datasets` table is modified, which may impact applications or other database objects that depend on this table.
