## High-level description
This SQL migration script removes the `client_configuration` column from the `datasets` table. It's a simple alteration of the table structure, likely part of a database schema update.

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE datasets DROP COLUMN client_configuration
#### Description
This SQL command modifies the structure of the `datasets` table by removing the `client_configuration` column.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `ALTER TABLE` statement is used to modify an existing table.
2. `datasets` is the name of the table being altered.
3. `DROP COLUMN` is the specific alteration being made, which removes a column from the table.
4. `client_configuration` is the name of the column being removed.

## Side Effects
- The `client_configuration` column and all its data will be permanently removed from the `datasets` table.
- Any queries or application code that previously relied on the `client_configuration` column will need to be updated to reflect this change.
- The storage space used by the `client_configuration` column will be freed up.

## Performance Considerations
- Depending on the size of the `datasets` table and the database management system being used, this operation could potentially be time-consuming for very large tables.
- It's generally advisable to perform such schema changes during low-traffic periods to minimize disruption to the application.

## TODOs
- The comment "-- Your SQL goes here" at the beginning of the file suggests that this might be a template or placeholder. Ensure that this is the intended SQL command before executing it in a production environment.
