## High-level description
This SQL migration file is designed to revert the changes made in the corresponding `up.sql` file. It adds a column named `client_configuration` of type `jsonb` to the `datasets` table.

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE datasets ADD COLUMN client_configuration jsonb;
#### Description
This SQL statement adds a new column to the `datasets` table. The column is named `client_configuration` and has a data type of `jsonb`.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `ALTER TABLE` command is used to modify the structure of an existing table.
2. `datasets` is the name of the table being altered.
3. `ADD COLUMN` specifies that a new column is being added to the table.
4. `client_configuration` is the name of the new column.
5. `jsonb` is the data type of the new column, which stands for "JSON Binary". This type is used to store JSON data in a decomposed binary format, which is more efficient for processing and querying than plain text JSON.

## Side Effects
- This migration will modify the structure of the `datasets` table by adding a new column.
- Any existing rows in the `datasets` table will have a `NULL` value in the new `client_configuration` column unless a default value is specified (which is not the case in this migration).
- Applications or queries that interact with the `datasets` table will now have access to this new column.

## Performance Considerations
Adding a column to an existing table can be a relatively quick operation in most database systems, especially if the table is not very large. However, for very large tables, this operation might take some time and could potentially lock the table during the process, depending on the database system and its configuration.

## TODOs
The comment at the top of the file suggests that this migration is intended to undo changes made in an `up.sql` file. It's important to ensure that this `down.sql` file correctly reverses all changes made in the corresponding `up.sql` file to maintain consistency in the database schema when rolling back migrations.
