## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for creating and managing a `card_metadata_count` table. The purpose of this table is to maintain a real-time count of rows in the `card_metadata` table. The migration includes both "up" and "down" scripts to facilitate database schema changes and rollbacks.

## What does it do?
The migration scripts in this directory set up a system to automatically track the number of rows in the `card_metadata` table. Here's a simplified explanation of what it does:

1. Creates a new table called `card_metadata_count` with two columns: an ID and a count of total rows.
2. Sets up an automatic counter (called a trigger) that updates the count in `card_metadata_count` whenever a row is added to or removed from the `card_metadata` table.
3. Provides a way to undo these changes if needed, removing the counter and the new table.

This setup allows the application to quickly know how many card metadata entries exist without having to count them each time, which can be faster and more efficient, especially if there are many entries.

## Key Files

### up.sql
This file contains the SQL commands to set up the new table and automatic counting system. It does the following:

1. Creates the `card_metadata_count` table with columns for ID and total row count.
2. Defines a function `update_card_metadata_count()` that adjusts the count when rows are added or removed.
3. Creates a trigger that calls this function whenever the `card_metadata` table changes.

Here's a snippet of the table creation:

```sql
CREATE TABLE card_metadata_count (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    total_rows BIGINT NOT NULL
);
```

### down.sql
This file contains the SQL commands to undo the changes made by `up.sql`. It removes the trigger, function, and table in reverse order:

```sql
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS card_metadata_count_trigger ON card_metadata;
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS update_card_metadata_count();
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS card_metadata_count;
```

## Configuration
This migration doesn't require any external configuration. However, it assumes the existence of a `card_metadata` table in the database. The migration will create a new table `card_metadata_count` and set up triggers on the `card_metadata` table.

Key points to note:
- The `card_metadata_count` table uses a UUID as its primary key.
- The `total_rows` column is of type BIGINT, allowing for a very large number of rows to be counted.
- The trigger function and trigger are named `update_card_metadata_count()` and `card_metadata_count_trigger` respectively.

These names and data types are important to remember if you need to reference or modify this functionality in the future.
