## High-level description
This SQL migration file is designed to undo the changes made in the corresponding `up.sql` file. It drops the `invitations` table if it exists in the database.

## Symbols

### `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS invitations;`
#### Description
This SQL command is used to remove the `invitations` table from the database schema.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `IF EXISTS` clause is used to prevent errors if the table doesn't exist.
2. If the `invitations` table exists, it will be completely removed from the database, including all its data and structure.
3. If the table doesn't exist, the command will have no effect and will not raise an error.

## Side Effects
- Permanent deletion of the `invitations` table and all its contents from the database.
- Any dependencies on the `invitations` table (e.g., foreign key constraints, views, or triggers) may be affected or become invalid after this operation.

## Performance Considerations
This operation is typically fast, as it simply removes the table structure from the database metadata. However, for very large tables or in databases with many concurrent operations, it might cause a brief lock on the schema.

## Error Handling
The `IF EXISTS` clause provides a basic form of error handling by preventing the command from failing if the table doesn't exist. This makes the migration more robust and idempotent, allowing it to be run multiple times without error.
