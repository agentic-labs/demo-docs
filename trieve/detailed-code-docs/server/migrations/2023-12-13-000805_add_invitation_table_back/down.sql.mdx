## High-level description
This SQL script defines a database migration that reverts the changes introduced by the corresponding `up.sql` migration. Specifically, it drops the `invitations` table if it exists.

## Symbols

### `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS invitations;`
#### Description
This SQL statement attempts to drop the `invitations` table from the database. The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the statement executes successfully even if the table does not exist.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Check for existence:** The database checks if a table named `invitations` exists.
2. **Conditional drop:**
   - If the table exists, it is dropped, removing its definition and all associated data.
   - If the table does not exist, no action is taken.
