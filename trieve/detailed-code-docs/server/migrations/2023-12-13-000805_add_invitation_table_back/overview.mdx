## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for adding an `invitations` table to the database. The migration is dated 2023-12-13 and is identified by the timestamp 000805. The purpose of these scripts is to manage the creation and removal of the `invitations` table, which is designed to store information about invitations sent to users for accessing specific datasets.

## What does it do?
The migration scripts in this directory perform the following actions:

1. Create a new table: The `up.sql` script creates an `invitations` table in the database. This table is used to store details about invitations, including who they're sent to, which dataset they're for, whether they've been used, and when they expire.

2. Remove the table: The `down.sql` script provides a way to undo the changes made by the `up.sql` script. It drops the `invitations` table if it exists, effectively removing all invitation data from the database.

These scripts allow the database schema to be versioned and managed alongside the application code. They enable developers to apply or revert changes to the database structure in a controlled manner, ensuring consistency across different environments and facilitating collaborative development.

## Key Files

### up.sql
This file contains the SQL commands to create the `invitations` table. Here's a breakdown of the table structure:

```sql
CREATE TABLE invitations (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    dataset_id UUID NOT NULL,
    used BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE,
    expires_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

The table includes fields for:
- A unique identifier (`id`)
- The invitee's email address (`email`)
- The associated dataset (`dataset_id`)
- A flag indicating if the invitation has been used (`used`)
- An expiration timestamp (`expires_at`)
- Creation and update timestamps (`created_at` and `updated_at`)

### down.sql
This file contains the SQL command to drop the `invitations` table:

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS invitations;
```

This command removes the `invitations` table if it exists, allowing the migration to be rolled back if necessary.

## Configuration
These migration scripts don't require any additional configuration. They are typically executed by a database migration tool or framework that manages the order and application of migrations. The naming convention of the directory (including the date and timestamp) is likely used by the migration tool to determine the order in which migrations should be applied or rolled back.
