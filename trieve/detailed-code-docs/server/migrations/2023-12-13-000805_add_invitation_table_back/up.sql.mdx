### `invitations` table
#### Description
This SQL statement creates a new table named `invitations` to store data related to invitations for accessing datasets.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a table definition, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a table definition, not a function.

#### Internal Logic
The table schema includes the following columns:

* **`id`**: A universally unique identifier (UUID) serving as the primary key for each invitation, ensuring each entry is unique and identifiable.
* **`email`**: Stores the email address (up to 100 characters) of the invitee. This field is not nullable, meaning an email address is mandatory for each invitation.
* **`dataset_id`**: A UUID referencing the specific dataset the invitation grants access to. This field is also not nullable, enforcing a relationship between invitations and datasets.
* **`used`**: A boolean flag indicating whether the invitation has been used to sign up. It defaults to `FALSE`.
* **`expires_at`**: A timestamp indicating when the invitation will expire. This field is not nullable, meaning an expiration date is required for each invitation.
* **`created_at`**: A timestamp automatically populated with the date and time when the invitation was created.
* **`updated_at`**: A timestamp automatically updated whenever the invitation record is modified.
