## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for modifying the `chunk_metadata` table in a database. The migration is specifically focused on removing the `tag_set` column from the table. The directory includes both "up" and "down" migration scripts, allowing for the change to be applied or reverted as needed.

## What does it do?
The migration scripts in this directory perform the following actions:

1. The "up" migration (in `up.sql`) removes the `tag_set` column from the `chunk_metadata` table. This action deletes any data stored in this column and modifies the table structure.

2. The "down" migration (in `down.sql`) adds the `tag_set` column back to the `chunk_metadata` table. This allows the change to be reverted if necessary. The new column is defined as an array of text strings with a default value of an empty array.

These migrations allow database administrators or developers to manage changes to the database schema in a controlled and reversible manner. The removal of the `tag_set` column suggests that this piece of metadata is no longer needed for chunks, possibly due to changes in the application's data model or functionality.

## Key Files

### up.sql
This file contains the SQL command to remove the `tag_set` column from the `chunk_metadata` table. The key SQL statement is:

```sql
ALTER TABLE chunk_metadata DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS tag_set;
```

This command uses the `IF EXISTS` clause to ensure that the operation only proceeds if the column is present, preventing errors if the column has already been removed.

### down.sql
This file contains the SQL command to add the `tag_set` column back to the `chunk_metadata` table. The key SQL statement is:

```sql
ALTER TABLE chunk_metadata ADD COLUMN tag_set TEXT[] DEFAULT '{}';
```

This command adds a new `tag_set` column of type `TEXT[]` (an array of text strings) with a default value of an empty array (`{}`).

## Configuration
The migration is identified by its timestamp in the directory name: `2024-06-06-042117`. This timestamp likely corresponds to when the migration was created and helps maintain the order of migrations in the larger migration history of the project.

No additional configuration files or environment variables are used in this migration.
