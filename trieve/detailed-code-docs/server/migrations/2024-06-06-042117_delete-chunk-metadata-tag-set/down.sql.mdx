title: "down.sql"

## High-level description
This SQL migration file is designed to revert the changes made in the corresponding `up.sql` file. It adds back a column named `tag_set` to the `chunk_metadata` table, which was presumably removed in the `up.sql` migration.

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE chunk_metadata
#### Description
This SQL command modifies the structure of the `chunk_metadata` table by adding a new column.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `ALTER TABLE` statement is used to modify the `chunk_metadata` table.
2. The `ADD COLUMN` clause is used to add a new column named `tag_set`.
3. The new column is defined with the following characteristics:
   - Data type: `TEXT[]` (an array of text values)
   - Default value: `'{}'` (an empty array)

## Side Effects
- This migration will modify the structure of the `chunk_metadata` table in the database.
- Any existing rows in the `chunk_metadata` table will have the new `tag_set` column added with the default value of an empty array.

## Performance Considerations
Adding a new column to an existing table can be a potentially expensive operation, especially if the table contains a large number of rows. The performance impact will depend on the database system being used and the size of the `chunk_metadata` table.

## Notes
1. This migration is intended to be run to revert changes made by a corresponding `up.sql` migration.
2. The comment at the top of the file indicates that this script should undo anything done in the `up.sql` file.
3. It's important to ensure that this `down.sql` migration accurately reverses the changes made in the corresponding `up.sql` file to maintain database consistency when rolling back migrations.
