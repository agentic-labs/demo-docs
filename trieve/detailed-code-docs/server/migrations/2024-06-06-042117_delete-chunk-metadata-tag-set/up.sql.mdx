## High-level description
This SQL script defines an up migration that removes the `tag_set` column from the `chunk_metadata` table. 

## Symbols

### `ALTER TABLE chunk_metadata DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS tag_set;`
#### Description
This SQL statement alters the `chunk_metadata` table by dropping the `tag_set` column if it exists. 

#### Internal Logic
1. **`ALTER TABLE chunk_metadata`**: This clause initiates an alteration to the table named `chunk_metadata`.
2. **`DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS tag_set`**: This clause specifies the action to be performed on the table. It attempts to drop (delete) a column named `tag_set`. The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the operation only proceeds if the column actually exists in the table. This prevents errors if the column has already been removed.

#### Side Effects
- The `tag_set` column will be removed from the `chunk_metadata` table.
- Any data previously stored in the `tag_set` column will be permanently deleted.
