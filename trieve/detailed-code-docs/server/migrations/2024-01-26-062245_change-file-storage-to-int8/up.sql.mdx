## High-level description
This SQL script performs a database migration, specifically altering the data type of the `file_storage` column in two tables: `stripe_plans` and `organization_usage_counts`. The column's data type is changed from its previous type (which is not specified in this script) to `BIGINT`.

## Symbols

### `ALTER TABLE stripe_plans ALTER COLUMN file_storage TYPE BIGINT;`
#### Description
This statement modifies the `stripe_plans` table, specifically changing the data type of the `file_storage` column to `BIGINT`. This suggests that the `file_storage` column likely stores a numerical value related to file storage capacity or usage.

#### Internal Logic
- **`ALTER TABLE stripe_plans`**: This part targets the `stripe_plans` table for modification.
- **`ALTER COLUMN file_storage`**: This specifies that the `file_storage` column within the table is the target of the alteration.
- **`TYPE BIGINT`**: This defines the new data type for the `file_storage` column as `BIGINT`.

### `ALTER TABLE organization_usage_counts ALTER COLUMN file_storage TYPE BIGINT;`
#### Description
This statement is very similar to the previous one. It modifies the `organization_usage_counts` table, changing the data type of the `file_storage` column to `BIGINT`. This suggests a similar need to accommodate potentially larger numerical values for file storage data in this table as well.

#### Internal Logic
- **`ALTER TABLE organization_usage_counts`**: This part targets the `organization_usage_counts` table for modification.
- **`ALTER COLUMN file_storage`**: This specifies that the `file_storage` column within the table is being altered.
- **`TYPE BIGINT`**: This sets the new data type for the `file_storage` column to `BIGINT`.
