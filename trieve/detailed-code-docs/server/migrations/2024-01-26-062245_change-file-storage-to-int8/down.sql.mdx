## High-level description
This SQL script contains database migration commands to revert a change related to the data type of the `file_storage` column in the `stripe_plans` and `organization_usage_counts` tables. It specifically undoes the changes made by the corresponding `up.sql` migration script.

## Symbols
### `ALTER TABLE stripe_plans ALTER COLUMN file_storage TYPE INTEGER;`

- May impact applications querying or inserting data into the `file_storage` column.

### `ALTER TABLE organization_usage_counts ALTER COLUMN file_storage TYPE INTEGER;`
#### Description
Similar to the previous statement, this one alters the `organization_usage_counts` table. It changes the data type of the `file_storage` column back to `INTEGER`, undoing a potential previous modification to a more specific integer type.

#### Side Effects
