## High-level description
This SQL script performs a database migration that reverses the changes introduced in the corresponding `up.sql` script. Specifically, it alters the data type of the `file_storage` column in the `stripe_plans` and `organization_usage_counts` tables from a potentially larger integer type back to `INTEGER`.

## Symbols

### `ALTER TABLE stripe_plans ALTER COLUMN file_storage TYPE INTEGER;`
#### Description
This SQL statement modifies the `stripe_plans` table by changing the data type of the `file_storage` column to `INTEGER`. This is likely reverting a previous change where the column was altered to a different integer type, possibly to accommodate larger values.

#### Side Effects
- Modifies the data type of the `file_storage` column in the `stripe_plans` table.

### `ALTER TABLE organization_usage_counts ALTER COLUMN file_storage TYPE INTEGER;`
#### Description
Similar to the previous statement, this one alters the `organization_usage_counts` table. It changes the data type of the `file_storage` column back to `INTEGER`, undoing a potential previous modification that used a different integer type.

#### Side Effects
- Modifies the data type of the `file_storage` column in the `organization_usage_counts` table.
