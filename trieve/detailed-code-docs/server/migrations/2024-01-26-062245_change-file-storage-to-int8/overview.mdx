## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for altering the data type of the `file_storage` column in two tables: `stripe_plans` and `organization_usage_counts`. The migration changes the column type from `INTEGER` to `BIGINT`, allowing for larger storage values to be represented.

## What does it do?
The migration scripts in this directory perform a database schema change to accommodate larger file storage values. This is likely done to support organizations or plans that require more storage capacity than what can be represented by a standard integer.

1. The `up.sql` script upgrades the database schema by changing the `file_storage` column type to `BIGINT` in both the `stripe_plans` and `organization_usage_counts` tables.
2. The `down.sql` script provides a way to revert these changes, changing the column type back to `INTEGER` if needed.

This change allows the system to handle file storage values larger than 2,147,483,647 bytes (about 2GB), which is the maximum value for a 32-bit integer. By using `BIGINT`, the system can now represent file storage sizes up to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 bytes (about 8 exabytes).

## Key Files

### up.sql
This file contains the SQL commands to upgrade the database schema:

```sql
ALTER TABLE stripe_plans ALTER COLUMN file_storage TYPE BIGINT;
ALTER TABLE organization_usage_counts ALTER COLUMN file_storage TYPE BIGINT;
```

These commands change the `file_storage` column type to `BIGINT` in both the `stripe_plans` and `organization_usage_counts` tables.

### down.sql
This file contains the SQL commands to revert the changes made by `up.sql`:

```sql
ALTER TABLE stripe_plans ALTER COLUMN file_storage TYPE INTEGER;
ALTER TABLE organization_usage_counts ALTER COLUMN file_storage TYPE INTEGER;
```

These commands change the `file_storage` column type back to `INTEGER` in both tables, effectively undoing the migration if necessary.

## Configuration
The migration is identified by its timestamp: `2024-01-26-062245`. This timestamp is likely used by the database migration tool to track which migrations have been applied and in what order.

No additional configuration appears to be required for this migration. The changes are straightforward alterations of column data types and should be applied automatically by the database migration tool when running the migration.

It's important to note that while changing from `INTEGER` to `BIGINT` is generally safe and won't cause data loss, reverting from `BIGINT` to `INTEGER` could potentially result in data truncation if any values larger than the maximum `INTEGER` value have been stored in the meantime. Care should be taken when deciding to roll back this migration.
