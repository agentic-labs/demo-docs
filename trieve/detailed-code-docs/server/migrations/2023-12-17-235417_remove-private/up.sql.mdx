## High-level description
This SQL migration script removes the 'private' column from two tables: 'card_metadata' and 'files'. It's designed to modify the database schema by eliminating the privacy flag from these tables.

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE card_metadata DROP COLUMN private
#### Description
This SQL command removes the 'private' column from the 'card_metadata' table.

#### Internal Logic
The command uses the ALTER TABLE statement to modify the structure of the 'card_metadata' table. The DROP COLUMN clause is used to remove the 'private' column entirely from this table.

### ALTER TABLE files DROP COLUMN private
#### Description
This SQL command removes the 'private' column from the 'files' table.

#### Internal Logic
Similar to the previous command, this uses the ALTER TABLE statement to modify the 'files' table structure. The DROP COLUMN clause is used to remove the 'private' column from this table.

## Side Effects
- The 'private' column and all its data will be permanently removed from both the 'card_metadata' and 'files' tables.
- Any queries, views, or application code that previously relied on the 'private' column in these tables will need to be updated to reflect this change.
- The storage space used by the 'private' column in both tables will be freed up.

## Performance Considerations
- Depending on the size of the tables and the database management system being used, this operation could potentially be time-consuming for large tables.
- It's advisable to run this migration during a maintenance window or a period of low database activity to minimize impact on system performance and user experience.

## Error Handling
This script does not include explicit error handling. If the 'private' column doesn't exist in either table, the SQL command will likely fail. It's important to ensure that the column exists before running this migration.

## TODOs
Consider adding a down migration script to revert these changes if necessary. This would involve recreating the 'private' columns in both tables.
