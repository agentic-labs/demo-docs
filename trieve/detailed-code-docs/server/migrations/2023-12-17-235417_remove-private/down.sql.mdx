title: "down.sql"

## High-level description
This SQL migration script is designed to revert the changes made in the corresponding `up.sql` file. It adds back the `private` column to both the `card_metadata` and `files` tables, which were presumably removed in the `up.sql` migration.

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE card_metadata
#### Description
This SQL command adds the `private` column back to the `card_metadata` table.

#### Internal Logic
- Adds a new column named `private` to the `card_metadata` table
- Sets the column type as boolean
- Makes the column NOT NULL
- Sets a default value of false for the column

### ALTER TABLE files
#### Description
This SQL command adds the `private` column back to the `files` table.

#### Internal Logic
- Adds a new column named `private` to the `files` table
- Sets the column type as boolean
- Makes the column NOT NULL
- Sets a default value of false for the column

## Notes
- This is a database migration down script, typically used in database version control systems to revert changes made by an up migration.
- The script assumes that the `card_metadata` and `files` tables already exist in the database.
- The `private` column is added with the same specifications to both tables, suggesting that this property was common to both entities in the previous database schema.
- The default value of `false` for the `private` column indicates that newly added records will be public by default unless explicitly set to private.
