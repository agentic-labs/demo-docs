## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for removing the `private` column from the `card_metadata` and `files` tables in a database. The migration is identified by the timestamp 2023-12-17-235417 and is named "remove-private". The directory includes two SQL files: `up.sql` for applying the migration and `down.sql` for reverting it.

## What does it do?
This migration modifies the database structure by removing a feature related to privacy settings for card metadata and files. Here's what happens:

1. When the migration is applied (`up.sql`):
   - The `private` column is removed from the `card_metadata` table.
   - The `private` column is removed from the `files` table.

2. If the migration needs to be reverted (`down.sql`):
   - A `private` column is added back to the `card_metadata` table.
   - A `private` column is added back to the `files` table.
   - Both new columns are set as boolean, not allowing null values, with a default value of `false`.

This migration essentially removes a privacy feature from the system, possibly simplifying the data model or changing how privacy is managed for cards and files.

## Key Files

1. `up.sql`:
   This file contains the SQL commands to apply the migration. It removes the `private` column from both the `card_metadata` and `files` tables. Here's the content:

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE card_metadata DROP COLUMN private;
   ALTER TABLE files DROP COLUMN private;
   ```

2. `down.sql`:
   This file contains the SQL commands to revert the migration. It adds back the `private` column to both tables with specific constraints. Here's the content:

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE card_metadata
   ADD COLUMN private boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT false;

   ALTER TABLE files
   ADD COLUMN private boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT false;
   ```

These files work together to provide a reversible database change, allowing the system to either remove or re-add the `private` column as needed.

## Configuration
The migration is identified by its timestamp (2023-12-17-235417) and name (remove-private). This naming convention is likely used by a database migration tool to track and apply changes in the correct order.
