## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for removing the 'private' column from the 'card_metadata' and 'files' tables in a database schema. It includes both an 'up' migration to remove the column and a 'down' migration to add it back if needed.

## What does it do?
These migration scripts modify the database structure by removing a feature related to privacy settings. The 'up' migration removes the 'private' column from two tables: 'card_metadata' and 'files'. This action effectively eliminates the ability to mark individual cards or files as private within the database.

The 'down' migration does the opposite: it adds the 'private' column back to both tables. This column is set as a boolean (true/false) value, with a default of false, meaning that by default, items are not private.

This change suggests that the application is moving away from a per-item privacy model, possibly towards a different privacy management approach or removing the concept of private items altogether.

## Key Files

1. up.sql
   - Purpose: Removes the 'private' column from 'card_metadata' and 'files' tables.
   - Key operations:
     ```sql
     ALTER TABLE card_metadata DROP COLUMN private;
     ALTER TABLE files DROP COLUMN private;
     ```

2. down.sql
   - Purpose: Adds back the 'private' column to 'card_metadata' and 'files' tables.
   - Key operations:
     ```sql
     ALTER TABLE card_metadata ADD COLUMN private BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false;
     ALTER TABLE files ADD COLUMN private BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false;
     ```

## Configuration
The migration is identified by its timestamp: 2023-12-17-235417. This timestamp is likely used by a database migration tool to track which migrations have been applied and in what order.

## Side Effects and Considerations

1. Data Loss: The 'up' migration will permanently remove the 'private' column and all its data from both tables. This operation is irreversible unless a backup is made or the 'down' migration is run.

2. Application Impact: Any part of the application that previously used the 'private' column in these tables will need to be updated. This could include queries, API endpoints, or user interface elements that dealt with privacy settings for individual cards or files.

3. Performance: For large tables, these operations could be time-consuming. It's advisable to run these migrations during low-traffic periods.

4. Error Handling: The scripts don't include explicit error handling. If the 'private' column doesn't exist when running the 'up' migration, or if it already exists when running the 'down' migration, the operation will likely fail.

5. Default Behavior: In the 'down' migration, the 'private' column is added with a default value of false. This means that if the column is re-added, all existing records will be set as not private by default.

6. Consistency: The same change is applied to both 'card_metadata' and 'files' tables, suggesting that these entities shared a common privacy model in the previous schema.

When implementing these changes, developers should ensure that all related application code is updated to reflect the new schema, and that any features or user expectations regarding item-level privacy are addressed in the updated system design.
