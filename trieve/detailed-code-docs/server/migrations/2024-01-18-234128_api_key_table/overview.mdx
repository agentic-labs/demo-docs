## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for creating and managing a new `user_api_key` table and modifying the existing `users` table in the database. The migration is dated 2024-01-18-234128, indicating when it was created. The purpose of these scripts is to implement a more scalable approach to managing API keys by separating them from user data into a dedicated table.

## What does it do?
The migration scripts in this directory perform the following actions:

1. Create a new table called `user_api_key` to store API keys associated with users.
2. Remove the `api_key_hash` column from the existing `users` table.
3. Provide a way to revert these changes if needed.

This change allows for a more flexible and scalable management of API keys. Instead of storing API key information directly in the `users` table, it creates a separate table that can handle multiple API keys per user, each with its own metadata such as name, creation date, and last update date.

## Key Files
The directory contains two important SQL files:

1. `up.sql`: This file contains the SQL commands to apply the migration. It creates the `user_api_key` table and removes the `api_key_hash` column from the `users` table.

2. `down.sql`: This file contains the SQL commands to revert the migration. It drops the `user_api_key` table and adds back the `api_key_hash` column to the `users` table.

### up.sql
The `up.sql` file performs the following actions:

1. Creates a new `user_api_key` table with the following structure:
   - `id`: UUID, primary key
   - `user_id`: UUID, foreign key referencing the `users` table
   - `api_key_hash`: TEXT, unique hash of the API key
   - `name`: TEXT, name of the API key (default: 'default')
   - `created_at`: TIMESTAMP of creation
   - `updated_at`: TIMESTAMP of last update

2. Removes the `api_key_hash` column from the `users` table.

Here's the key part of the `up.sql` script:

```sql
CREATE TABLE user_api_key (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    user_id UUID NOT NULL,
    api_key_hash TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    name TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'default',
    created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

ALTER TABLE users DROP COLUMN api_key_hash;
```

### down.sql
The `down.sql` file reverts the changes made by `up.sql`:

1. Drops the `user_api_key` table.
2. Adds back the `api_key_hash` column to the `users` table.

Here's the content of the `down.sql` script:

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS user_api_key;
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN api_key_hash TEXT;
```

## Dependencies
This migration depends on the existence of a `users` table with an `id` column of type UUID. It also uses PostgreSQL-specific functions like `gen_random_uuid()` for generating UUIDs.

## Configuration
There are no specific configuration files or environment variables used in these migration scripts. However, the database connection details and migration execution would typically be managed by the application's database migration tool or ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) system.

In conclusion, this migration represents a significant change in how API keys are managed in the application. By moving API keys to a separate table, it allows for more flexible key management, including the possibility of multiple keys per user and additional metadata for each key. The migration scripts provide a clear path to apply this change and revert it if necessary.
