## High-level description
This SQL script creates a new table named `user_api_key` to store API keys associated with users and removes the `api_key_hash` column from the `users` table. This suggests a migration towards a more scalable way of managing API keys, separating them from user data.

## Code Structure
The code first defines the structure of the `user_api_key` table. Then, it modifies the existing `users` table by removing the `api_key_hash` column.

## References
This script references the `users` table, specifically the `id` column for the foreign key constraint.

## Symbols
### `user_api_key` table
#### Description
This table stores API keys associated with users. Each API key is uniquely linked to a user and has a hash, name, creation date, and last updated date.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a table definition, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a table definition, not a function.

#### Internal Logic
The table schema is defined with the following columns:

- `id`: UUID, primary key, default value is a randomly generated UUID.
- `user_id`: UUID, not null, foreign key referencing the `users` table, ensures each API key is associated with a user.
- `api_key_hash`: TEXT, not null, unique, stores the hash of the API key.
- `name`: TEXT, not null, default value is 'default', allows users to name their API keys.
- `created_at`: TIMESTAMP, not null, default value is the current timestamp, records when the API key was created.
- `updated_at`: TIMESTAMP, not null, default value is the current timestamp, records when the API key was last updated.

The foreign key constraint `FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE` ensures that if a user is deleted, all associated API keys are also deleted.

### `ALTER TABLE users DROP COLUMN api_key_hash;`
#### Description
This statement removes the `api_key_hash` column from the `users` table.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a SQL statement, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a SQL statement, not a function.

#### Internal Logic
This statement modifies the existing `users` table by deleting the `api_key_hash` column. This suggests that API keys are being moved to a separate table (`user_api_key`) and are no longer stored directly within the `users` table.

## Side Effects
- Creates a new table named `user_api_key`.
- Removes the `api_key_hash` column from the `users` table.

## Dependencies
This script depends on the existence of the `users` table with an `id` column of type UUID.
