## High-level description
This SQL script reverts a database migration by recreating the `card_metadata_count` table and its associated trigger. This table and trigger are responsible for maintaining a count of the total rows in the `card_metadata` table.

## Symbols
### `CREATE TABLE card_metadata_count`
#### Description
This statement creates a new table named `card_metadata_count` to store the count of rows in the `card_metadata` table.

#### Internal Logic
- The table has a single column `total_rows` of type `BIGINT` to store the row count.
- The `id` column is a UUID that serves as the primary key.

### `INSERT INTO card_metadata_count`
#### Description
This statement inserts the initial row count into the newly created `card_metadata_count` table.

#### Internal Logic
- It retrieves the total number of rows from the `card_metadata` table using a subquery (`SELECT COUNT(*) FROM card_metadata`).
- This count is then inserted as the value for the `total_rows` column in the `card_metadata_count` table.

### `CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_card_metadata_count()`
#### Description
This statement defines a trigger function named `update_card_metadata_count` written in PL/pgSQL. This function is executed by the trigger `card_metadata_count_trigger` whenever rows are inserted into or deleted from the `card_metadata` table.

#### Internal Logic
- It checks the type of operation being performed (`INSERT` or `DELETE`) using `TG_OP`.
- If it's an `INSERT`, it increments the `total_rows` in `card_metadata_count` by 1.
- If it's a `DELETE`, it decrements the `total_rows` in `card_metadata_count` by 1.

### `CREATE TRIGGER card_metadata_count_trigger`
#### Description
This statement creates a trigger named `card_metadata_count_trigger` on the `card_metadata` table.

#### Internal Logic
- The trigger is set to fire `AFTER` an `INSERT` or `DELETE` operation on the `card_metadata` table.
- It executes the `update_card_metadata_count()` function for each row affected by the triggering statement. This ensures that the `card_metadata_count` table is updated accordingly whenever rows are added or removed from the `card_metadata` table.

## Side Effects
- **Creates a table:** A new table `card_metadata_count` is created in the database.
- **Creates a trigger:** A trigger `card_metadata_count_trigger` is created on the `card_metadata` table.
- **Modifies data:** The `total_rows` value in the `card_metadata_count` table is updated whenever rows are inserted into or deleted from the `card_metadata` table.
