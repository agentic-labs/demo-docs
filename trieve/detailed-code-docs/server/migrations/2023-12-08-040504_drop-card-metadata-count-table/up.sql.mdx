## High-level description
This SQL migration script removes the `card_metadata_count` table, its associated trigger, and the function used to update the count. It's designed to clean up and remove a previously implemented counting mechanism for card metadata.

## Symbols

### DROP TABLE card_metadata_count
#### Description
This command removes the `card_metadata_count` table from the database schema.

#### Internal Logic
The `DROP TABLE` statement permanently deletes the specified table and all its data from the database.

### DROP TRIGGER card_metadata_count_trigger ON card_metadata
#### Description
This command removes the trigger named `card_metadata_count_trigger` that was previously associated with the `card_metadata` table.

#### Internal Logic
The `DROP TRIGGER` statement removes the specified trigger, which was likely used to automatically update the `card_metadata_count` table whenever changes occurred in the `card_metadata` table.

### DROP FUNCTION update_card_metadata_count()
#### Description
This command removes the function named `update_card_metadata_count()` from the database.

#### Internal Logic
The `DROP FUNCTION` statement deletes the specified function, which was probably used by the trigger to perform the actual counting and updating of the `card_metadata_count` table.

## Side Effects
- The `card_metadata_count` table and all its data will be permanently removed.
- The automatic updating mechanism for card metadata counts will no longer function.
- Any queries or application logic relying on the `card_metadata_count` table will fail and need to be updated.

## Error Handling
This migration script does not include explicit error handling. If any of the objects (table, trigger, or function) do not exist when the DROP statements are executed, the migration may fail. It's assumed that these objects exist in the current database schema.

## TODOs
- Ensure that any application code or queries that depended on the `card_metadata_count` table are updated or removed.
- Verify that the removal of this counting mechanism doesn't negatively impact any existing functionality.
- Consider implementing alternative methods for tracking card metadata counts if still necessary for the application.
