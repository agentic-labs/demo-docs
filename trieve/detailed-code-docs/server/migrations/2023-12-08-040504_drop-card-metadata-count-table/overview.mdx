## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for dropping the `card_metadata_count` table and its associated trigger and function. The migration is dated 2023-12-08 and is identified by the timestamp 040504. The directory includes two SQL files: `up.sql` for applying the migration and `down.sql` for reverting it.

## What does it do?
The migration scripts in this directory perform the following actions:

1. The `up.sql` script removes a table called `card_metadata_count`, a trigger named `card_metadata_count_trigger` on the `card_metadata` table, and a function called `update_card_metadata_count`. This suggests that the system is no longer using a separate table to maintain a count of rows in the `card_metadata` table.

2. The `down.sql` script provides a way to revert the changes made by `up.sql`. It recreates the `card_metadata_count` table, populates it with the current count of rows in `card_metadata`, and sets up a trigger and function to keep this count updated automatically.

These scripts allow database administrators or developers to apply or roll back changes to the database structure related to tracking the number of rows in the `card_metadata` table.

## Key Files

### up.sql
This file contains the SQL commands to apply the migration:

```sql
DROP TABLE card_metadata_count;
DROP TRIGGER card_metadata_count_trigger ON card_metadata;
DROP FUNCTION update_card_metadata_count();
```

These commands remove the table, trigger, and function used for maintaining the row count of `card_metadata`.

### down.sql
This file contains the SQL commands to revert the migration:

```sql
CREATE TABLE card_metadata_count (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    total_rows BIGINT NOT NULL
);

INSERT INTO card_metadata_count (total_rows)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM card_metadata;

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_card_metadata_count()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
    IF (TG_OP = 'INSERT') THEN
        UPDATE card_metadata_count SET total_rows = total_rows + 1;
    ELSIF (TG_OP = 'DELETE') THEN
        UPDATE card_metadata_count SET total_rows = total_rows - 1;
    END IF;
    RETURN NULL;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE TRIGGER card_metadata_count_trigger
AFTER INSERT OR DELETE ON card_metadata
FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION update_card_metadata_count();
```

These commands recreate the `card_metadata_count` table, populate it with the current count, and set up a trigger and function to keep the count updated.

## Configuration
This migration does not rely on any external configuration files or environment variables. The SQL scripts are self-contained and can be executed directly on the database.

## Side Effects
Applying this migration (`up.sql`) will:
1. Permanently delete the `card_metadata_count` table and all its data.
2. Remove the `card_metadata_count_trigger` from the `card_metadata` table.
3. Delete the `update_card_metadata_count` function from the database.

Reverting this migration (`down.sql`) will:
1. Create a new `card_metadata_count` table with a UUID primary key and a `total_rows` column.
2. Populate the new table with the current count of rows in `card_metadata`.
3. Create a new `update_card_metadata_count` function to maintain the count.
4. Set up a new trigger `card_metadata_count_trigger` on the `card_metadata` table to automatically update the count.

It's important to note that if the migration is reverted after being applied, the recreated `card_metadata_count` table will only reflect the current state of the `card_metadata` table. Any historical data that might have been in the original table before it was dropped will not be recovered.
