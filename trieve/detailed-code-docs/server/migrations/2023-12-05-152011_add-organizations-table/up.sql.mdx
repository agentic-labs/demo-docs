## High-level description
This SQL script defines a database migration that creates a new table named `organizations`. The table is intended to store information about organizations, including their unique identifier, name, configuration, and timestamps for creation and last update.

## Symbols
### `organizations` table
#### Description
This SQL statement creates a new table named `organizations` with the following columns:

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a table definition, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a table definition, not a function.

#### Internal Logic
- `id`: A UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) column set as the primary key, automatically generated using the `gen_random_uuid()` function.
- `name`: A TEXT column storing the organization's name, defined as UNIQUE and NOT NULL to ensure each organization has a distinct name.
- `configuration`: A JSONB (JSON Binary) column to store organization-specific configurations. It's defined as NOT NULL, implying a default configuration might be required.
- `created_at`: A TIMESTAMP column automatically populated with the current timestamp when a new organization record is created.
- `updated_at`: A TIMESTAMP column automatically updated to the current timestamp whenever an organization record is modified.

### `idx_organizations_name` index
#### Description
This SQL statement creates an index on the `name` column of the `organizations` table.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is an index definition, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is an index definition, not a function.

#### Internal Logic
- The index is named `idx_organizations_name` and is created on the `name` column of the `organizations` table.
- This index aims to improve the performance of queries that search or filter organizations by their name.
