## High-level description
This SQL script contains database migration commands to reverse the changes introduced by the `up.sql` migration file, specifically related to the `organizations` table. It ensures that the database schema returns to its previous state before the `organizations` table was added.

## Symbols

### `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS organizations;`
#### Description
This SQL statement attempts to drop the `organizations` table. The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the statement executes successfully even if the `organizations` table doesn't exist.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Check for Existence:** The database checks if a table named `organizations` exists.
2. **Drop Table (If Exists):** If the `organizations` table exists, it is permanently deleted, along with all its data and associated constraints. If the table doesn't exist, the statement completes without any action.

### `DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_organizations_name;`
#### Description
This SQL statement attempts to drop the index named `idx_organizations_name`. The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the statement executes successfully even if the index doesn't exist.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Check for Existence:** The database checks if an index named `idx_organizations_name` exists.
2. **Drop Index (If Exists):** If the index exists, it is permanently deleted. If the index doesn't exist, the statement completes without any action.
