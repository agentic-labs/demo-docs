## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for adding a new `role` column to the `invitations` table in the database. It includes both the "up" migration to add the column and the "down" migration to remove it if needed.

## What does it do?
These migration scripts modify the structure of the `invitations` table in the database. The "up" migration adds a new column called `role` to store integer values representing different roles for invitations. This allows the system to associate specific roles with each invitation. The "down" migration provides a way to revert this change by removing the `role` column if necessary.

## Key Files

### up.sql
This file contains the SQL command to add the `role` column to the `invitations` table. The new column is defined as an integer, not allowing null values, and has a default value of 0. Here's the SQL command:

```sql
ALTER TABLE invitations ADD COLUMN role integer NOT NULL DEFAULT 0;
```

This ensures that every invitation will have a role associated with it, even if not explicitly set (defaulting to 0).

### down.sql
This file contains the SQL command to remove the `role` column from the `invitations` table if the migration needs to be reverted. The SQL command is:

```sql
ALTER TABLE invitations DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS role;
```

The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the operation doesn't fail if the column has already been removed.

## Configuration
These migration scripts don't require any additional configuration. They are designed to be run by a database migration tool (likely Diesel, given the project structure) which will execute these scripts in the appropriate order based on their timestamp (2024-01-11-202441).

## Side Effects
- Running the "up" migration will add the `role` column to all existing rows in the `invitations` table, setting the value to 0 for all existing invitations.
- Running the "down" migration will remove the `role` column and all data stored in it. This operation is irreversible, so it should be used with caution in production environments.

It's important to note that these migrations may temporarily lock the `invitations` table during execution, which could briefly impact application performance if run on a live system with active users.
