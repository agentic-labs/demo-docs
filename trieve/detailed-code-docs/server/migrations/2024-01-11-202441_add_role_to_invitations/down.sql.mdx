title: "down.sql"

## High-level description
This SQL script is a database migration file that reverts a change made to the `invitations` table. Specifically, it removes the `role` column. This suggests that the corresponding `up.sql` migration file likely added this column.

## Symbols

### `ALTER TABLE invitations DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS role;`
#### Description
This SQL statement removes the `role` column from the `invitations` table if it exists. The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the statement executes successfully even if the column has already been removed.

#### Internal Logic
1. **`ALTER TABLE invitations`**: This part of the statement targets the `invitations` table for modification.
2. **`DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS role`**: This instructs the database to remove the column named `role` if it exists in the `invitations` table. 

## Side Effects
- **Schema Change**: This migration directly modifies the database schema by removing the `role` column from the `invitations` table.
