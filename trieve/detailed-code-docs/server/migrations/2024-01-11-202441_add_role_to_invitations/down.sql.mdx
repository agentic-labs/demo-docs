## High-level description
This SQL script is a database migration file that reverts a change made to the `invitations` table. Specifically, it removes the `role` column.

## Symbols

### `ALTER TABLE invitations DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS role;`
#### Description
This SQL statement removes the `role` column from the `invitations` table if it exists. The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the statement executes successfully even if the column has already been removed.

#### Internal Logic
1. **`ALTER TABLE invitations`**: This part of the statement specifies that the `invitations` table is being modified.
2. **`DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS role`**: This part instructs the database to drop (remove) the column named `role` if it exists in the table. 

## Side Effects
This migration will result in the removal of the `role` column from the `invitations` table and any data stored in that column will be lost.
