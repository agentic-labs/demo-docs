## High-level description
This SQL script reverts the database migration defined in the corresponding `up.sql` file by dropping an index named `idx_dataset_tags_dataset_id`. This suggests that the `up.sql` file likely creates this index on the `dataset_tags` table.

## Symbols

### `DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_dataset_tags_dataset_id;`
#### Description
This SQL statement attempts to drop an index named `idx_dataset_tags_dataset_id`. The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the statement executes successfully even if the index does not exist. This is a common practice in database migration scripts to prevent errors during rollback.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Check for Existence:** The database checks if an index with the name `idx_dataset_tags_dataset_id` exists.
2. **Conditional Drop:**
   - If the index exists, the `DROP INDEX` statement is executed, removing the index from the database.
   - If the index does not exist, the statement completes without taking any action.

#### Side Effects
- **Index Removal:** If the index `idx_dataset_tags_dataset_id` exists, it will be removed from the database. This may impact the performance of queries that previously utilized this index.
