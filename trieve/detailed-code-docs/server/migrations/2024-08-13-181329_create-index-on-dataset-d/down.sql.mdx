## High-level description
This SQL script reverts the database migration defined in the corresponding `up.sql` file by dropping an index named `idx_dataset_tags_dataset_id` from the `dataset_tags` table. This action is typically performed during database rollback operations.

## Symbols

### `DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_dataset_tags_dataset_id;`
#### Description
This SQL statement attempts to drop an index named `idx_dataset_tags_dataset_id`. The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the operation doesn't fail if the index doesn't exist.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Check for Existence:** The database checks if an index with the name `idx_dataset_tags_dataset_id` exists.
2. **Drop Index (If Exists):** If the index exists, it is removed from the database.
3. **No Action (If Not Exists):** If the index doesn't exist, no action is taken.
