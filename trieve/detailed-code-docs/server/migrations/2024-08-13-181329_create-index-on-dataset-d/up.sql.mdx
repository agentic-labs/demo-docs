## High-level description
This SQL script creates an index on the `dataset_id` column of the `dataset_tags` table. This is intended to improve the performance of queries that filter datasets by their associated tags. 

## Symbols

### `CREATE INDEX idx_dataset_tags_dataset_id ON dataset_tags(dataset_id);`
#### Description
This SQL statement creates an index named `idx_dataset_tags_dataset_id` on the `dataset_id` column of the `dataset_tags` table. 

#### Internal Logic
* `CREATE INDEX`: This clause initiates the creation of a new index.
* `idx_dataset_tags_dataset_id`: This is the name assigned to the new index.
* `ON dataset_tags`: This specifies the table on which the index will be created.
* `(dataset_id)`: This defines the column (`dataset_id`) that the index will be based on.

#### Performance Considerations
Creating an index on a frequently queried column like `dataset_id` can significantly speed up data retrieval, especially for large tables. This is because the index allows the database to quickly locate rows that match a given `dataset_id` value, rather than having to scan the entire table.
