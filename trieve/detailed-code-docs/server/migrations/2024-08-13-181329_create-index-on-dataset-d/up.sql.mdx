## High-level description
This SQL script creates an index on the `dataset_id` column of the `dataset_tags` table. 
This is intended to improve the performance of queries that filter datasets by their associated tags.

## Symbols

### `CREATE INDEX idx_dataset_tags_dataset_id ON dataset_tags(dataset_id);`
#### Description
This statement creates an index named `idx_dataset_tags_dataset_id` on the `dataset_id` column of the `dataset_tags` table.

#### Internal Logic
* **`CREATE INDEX`**: This clause initiates the creation of a new index.
* **`idx_dataset_tags_dataset_id`**: This is the user-defined name for the new index.
* **`ON dataset_tags`**: This specifies the table on which the index will be created.
* **`(dataset_id)`**: This defines the column or set of columns to be included in the index. In this case, it's a single column `dataset_id`.

#### Performance Considerations
Creating an index on a frequently queried column like `dataset_id` can significantly speed up data retrieval, especially for large tables. This is because the index allows the database to quickly locate the relevant rows without having to scan the entire table.
