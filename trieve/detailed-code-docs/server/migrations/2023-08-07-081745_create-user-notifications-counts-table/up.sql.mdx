## High-level description
This SQL script creates a table `user_notification_counts` to store the count of unread notifications for each user and sets up triggers to automatically update this count when notifications are added or removed from the `verification_notifications` and `file_upload_completed_notifications` tables. It also initializes the `user_notification_counts` table with existing notification data.

## Code Structure
The code first creates the `user_notification_counts` table. Then, it defines a function `update_notification_count()` which is called by triggers defined for `verification_notifications` and `file_upload_completed_notifications` tables. Finally, it initializes the `user_notification_counts` table.

## References
This script references the following tables:
- `users`: Assumed to be a table containing user information, including a unique identifier `id`.
- `verification_notifications`: Assumed to be a table storing verification notifications, likely with a `user_uuid` column referencing the `users` table.
- `file_upload_completed_notifications`: Assumed to be a table storing file upload completion notifications, likely with a `user_uuid` column referencing the `users` table.

## Symbols
### `user_notification_counts` table
#### Description
This table stores the count of unread notifications for each user.

#### Columns
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | UUID | Unique identifier for each row, automatically generated. |
| user_uuid | UUID | Foreign key referencing the `users` table, ensuring each user has only one entry. |
| notification_count | INTEGER | The count of unread notifications for the user, defaults to 0. |

### `update_notification_count()` function
#### Description
This function is a trigger function that updates the `notification_count` in the `user_notification_counts` table whenever a new notification is inserted or deleted from the tables it is attached to.

#### Inputs
This function implicitly receives information about the triggering event (INSERT or DELETE) and the data being modified through the `TG_OP`, `NEW`, and `OLD` variables within the trigger context.

#### Outputs
Returns `NEW` for INSERT operations, effectively returning the newly inserted row. This behavior is likely irrelevant in this context as the returned value is not used.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Identifies the triggering event:** Checks if the trigger was activated by an INSERT or DELETE operation using `TG_OP`.
2. **Increments or decrements the count:**
    - If it's an INSERT, it increments the `notification_count` in `user_notification_counts` for the corresponding `user_uuid` using the `NEW.user_uuid` value from the inserted row.
    - If it's a DELETE, it decrements the `notification_count` in `user_notification_counts` for the corresponding `user_uuid` using the `OLD.user_uuid` value from the deleted row.

### `update_verification_notification_count` trigger
#### Description
This trigger calls the `update_notification_count()` function after each INSERT or DELETE operation on the `verification_notifications` table.

### `update_file_upload_notification_count` trigger
#### Description
This trigger calls the `update_notification_count()` function after each INSERT or DELETE operation on the `file_upload_completed_notifications` table.

### Initialization of `user_notification_counts`
#### Description
This part of the script initializes the `user_notification_counts` table with existing data from `verification_notifications` and `file_upload_completed_notifications`.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Selects distinct user_uuid:** It selects distinct `user_uuid` values from `file_upload_completed_notifications` to avoid duplicate entries for users.
2. **Calculates existing notification count:** For each distinct `user_uuid`, it calculates the total count of existing notifications by summing the counts from `verification_notifications` and `file_upload_completed_notifications`.
3. **Inserts data into user_notification_counts:** It inserts a new row into `user_notification_counts` for each distinct `user_uuid` with a generated UUID, the `user_uuid`, and the calculated `notification_count`.
