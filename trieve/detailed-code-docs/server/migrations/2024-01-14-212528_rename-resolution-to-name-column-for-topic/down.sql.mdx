## High-level description
This SQL migration script is designed to revert changes made in the corresponding `up.sql` file. It renames the `name` column back to `resolution` in the `topics` table.

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE topics RENAME COLUMN name TO resolution;
#### Description
This SQL statement renames the `name` column in the `topics` table back to `resolution`.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `ALTER TABLE` command is used to modify the structure of the `topics` table.
2. The `RENAME COLUMN` clause specifies that a column is being renamed.
3. `name TO resolution` indicates that the column currently named `name` should be renamed to `resolution`.

## Side Effects
- This migration will modify the structure of the `topics` table in the database.
- Any existing data in the `name` column will be preserved but will now be accessed under the column name `resolution`.
- Database queries or application code that relies on the `name` column will need to be updated to use `resolution` instead.

## Dependencies
This script depends on:
1. The existence of the `topics` table in the database.
2. The presence of a column named `name` in the `topics` table.

## Error Handling
No explicit error handling is implemented in this script. If the table or column doesn't exist, or if there are any issues with the renaming process, the database system will likely raise an error, and the migration will fail.

## TODOs
The comment at the top of the file suggests that this script should undo anything in the corresponding `up.sql` file. It's important to ensure that this down migration exactly reverses the changes made in the up migration to maintain database consistency when rolling back changes.
