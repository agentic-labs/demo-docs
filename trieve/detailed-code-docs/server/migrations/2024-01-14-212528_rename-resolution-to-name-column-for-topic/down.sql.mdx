## High-level description
This SQL script is a database migration file that reverts a change made to the `topics` table. Specifically, it renames the column `name` back to `resolution`. This suggests that a previous migration (likely in an `up.sql` file) renamed the `resolution` column to `name`.

## Symbols

### `ALTER TABLE topics RENAME COLUMN name TO resolution;`
#### Description
This SQL statement renames the `name` column in the `topics` table back to `resolution`. This is a single atomic operation within the database.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a single SQL statement, not a function with explicit inputs.

#### Outputs
N/A - This statement modifies the database schema directly and doesn't return a value.

#### Side Effects
- **Schema Change:** Renames the `name` column in the `topics` table to `resolution`. This change will be reflected in the database schema.

#### Performance Considerations
Renaming a column can be an expensive operation for very large tables as it may require a table lock and data copy. However, this is usually a fast operation.
