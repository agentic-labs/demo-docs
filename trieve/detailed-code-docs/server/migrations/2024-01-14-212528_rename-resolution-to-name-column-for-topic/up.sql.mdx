## Symbols

### `ALTER TABLE topics RENAME COLUMN resolution TO name;`
#### Description
This SQL statement renames the `resolution` column to `name` in the `topics` table.

#### Internal Logic
1. **`ALTER TABLE topics`**: This part of the statement specifies that we want to modify the structure of the table named `topics`.
2. **`RENAME COLUMN resolution TO name`**: This part instructs the database to rename the column currently named `resolution` to `name`.

#### Side Effects
- The `topics` table will now have a column named `name` instead of `resolution`.
- Any existing code or queries that reference the `resolution` column will need to be updated to use the new `name` column.
