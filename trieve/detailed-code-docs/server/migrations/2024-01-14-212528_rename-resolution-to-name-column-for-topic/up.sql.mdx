## High-level description
This SQL migration script renames the 'resolution' column to 'name' in the 'topics' table. It's a simple database schema modification to update the column name, likely to better reflect the purpose or content of the column.

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE topics RENAME COLUMN resolution TO name;
#### Description
This SQL statement alters the structure of the 'topics' table by renaming the 'resolution' column to 'name'.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `ALTER TABLE` command is used to modify the structure of an existing table.
2. `topics` is the name of the table being altered.
3. `RENAME COLUMN` specifies that a column is being renamed.
4. `resolution` is the current name of the column.
5. `TO name` specifies the new name for the column.

## Side Effects
- This migration will change the schema of the 'topics' table.
- Any existing queries, views, or application code that references the 'resolution' column will need to be updated to use 'name' instead.
- The data in the column remains unchanged; only the column name is affected.

## Performance Considerations
This operation is typically quick and does not involve data movement. However, on large tables or busy systems, it may briefly lock the table during the rename operation.

## TODOs
It's advisable to update any corresponding down migration script to reverse this change if needed, renaming 'name' back to 'resolution'.
