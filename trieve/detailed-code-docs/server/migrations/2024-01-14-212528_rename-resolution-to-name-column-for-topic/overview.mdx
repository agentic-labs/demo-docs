## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for renaming the 'resolution' column to 'name' in the 'topics' table of a database. It includes both an 'up' migration to implement the change and a 'down' migration to revert it if necessary. These scripts are part of a database schema modification process, likely to better reflect the purpose or content of the column.

## What does it do?
The migration scripts in this directory perform a simple but important task in database management:

1. The 'up' migration renames the 'resolution' column in the 'topics' table to 'name'. This change might be implemented to make the column name more intuitive or to align it with updated application requirements.

2. The 'down' migration does the opposite - it renames the 'name' column back to 'resolution'. This ensures that the database can be reverted to its previous state if needed, which is crucial for maintaining database consistency and allowing for rollbacks in case of issues.

These changes affect how the database structure is defined, but they don't alter the actual data stored in the column. However, they do impact how the data is accessed and referenced in the application code and database queries.

## Key Files

1. `up.sql`:
   This file contains the SQL command to rename the 'resolution' column to 'name' in the 'topics' table. The key SQL statement is:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE topics RENAME COLUMN resolution TO name;
   ```
   This script is run to implement the desired change in the database schema.

2. `down.sql`:
   This file contains the SQL command to revert the change made by `up.sql`. It renames the 'name' column back to 'resolution'. The key SQL statement is:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE topics RENAME COLUMN name TO resolution;
   ```
   This script is used if the migration needs to be rolled back.

## Dependencies
These migration scripts depend on:
1. The existence of a database system that supports SQL ALTER TABLE statements.
2. The presence of a 'topics' table in the database.
3. The existence of a 'resolution' column in the 'topics' table (for the 'up' migration).
4. The existence of a 'name' column in the 'topics' table (for the 'down' migration).

## Configuration
No specific configuration files or environment variables are used in these migration scripts. However, the database connection details and migration framework configuration would typically be managed elsewhere in the project.

## Side Effects
While these migrations don't affect the data itself, they do have several important side effects:

1. Schema Change: The structure of the 'topics' table is modified.
2. Code Impact: Any existing queries, views, or application code that references the 'resolution' column will need to be updated to use 'name' instead (or vice versa for the down migration).
3. Temporary Locking: During the migration, there may be a brief lock on the 'topics' table, which could impact database operations in a production environment.

## Performance Considerations
The rename operation is typically quick and doesn't involve data movement. However, on large tables or busy systems, it may briefly lock the table during the rename operation. It's advisable to schedule such migrations during low-traffic periods to minimize potential disruptions.

## Error Handling
These scripts don't include explicit error handling. If issues arise (e.g., the table or column doesn't exist), the database system will likely raise an error, and the migration will fail. It's important to test these migrations thoroughly in a non-production environment before applying them to a live system.

## TODOs
1. Ensure that all application code, queries, and database views that reference the 'resolution' column are updated to use 'name' instead.
2. After applying the 'up' migration, verify that the 'down' migration successfully reverts the change if executed.
3. Update any documentation or schema diagrams to reflect the new column name.
4. Consider adding comments to the SQL files explaining the reason for the column rename, which can be helpful for future maintenance.
