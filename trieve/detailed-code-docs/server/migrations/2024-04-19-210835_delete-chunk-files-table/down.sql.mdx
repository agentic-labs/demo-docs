## High-level description
This SQL script defines the down migration for reverting changes related to the `chunk_files` table. It aims to recreate the `chunk_files` table and its associated constraints that were likely dropped in the corresponding `up.sql` migration file.

## Symbols
### `CREATE TABLE chunk_files`
#### Description
This statement recreates the `chunk_files` table, which seems to store information about the relationship between chunks and files.

#### Internal Logic
- It defines the `id` column as a UUID primary key.
- It includes columns for `chunk_id` and `file_id`, both UUIDs referencing other tables (`chunk_metadata` and `files` respectively) and enforcing cascading updates and deletions.
- It adds `created_at` and `updated_at` columns with default values set to the current timestamp.

### `ALTER TABLE chunk_files ...`
#### Description
These statements add foreign key constraints to the `chunk_files` table.

#### Internal Logic
- The first `ALTER TABLE` statement adds a foreign key constraint named `chunk_files_chunk_id_fkey` to the `chunk_id` column, referencing the `id` column of the `chunk_metadata` table. It enforces cascading updates and deletions.
- The second `ALTER TABLE` statement adds a foreign key constraint named `chunk_files_file_id_fkey` to the `file_id` column, referencing the `id` column of the `files` table. It also enforces cascading updates and deletions.
