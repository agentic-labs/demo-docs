## High-level description
This SQL script is a database migration file designed to revert changes made in the corresponding `up.sql` file. It recreates the `chunk_files` table and its associated foreign key constraints, effectively undoing the deletion of this table.

### `chunk_files` table
#### Description
This SQL script recreates the `chunk_files` table, which appears to be a junction table linking chunks (from `chunk_metadata`) to files.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates the `chunk_files` table with the following columns:
   - `id`: A UUID serving as the primary key
   - `chunk_id`: A UUID referencing the `chunk_metadata` table
   - `file_id`: A UUID referencing the `files` table
   - `created_at`: A timestamp with timezone, defaulting to the current time
   - `updated_at`: A timestamp with timezone, defaulting to the current time

2. Adds two foreign key constraints:
   - `chunk_files_chunk_id_fkey`: Links `chunk_id` to the `id` column in the `chunk_metadata` table
   - `chunk_files_file_id_fkey`: Links `file_id` to the `id` column in the `files` table

Both foreign key constraints are set to cascade on update and delete operations.

## Dependencies
This migration script depends on the existence of two other tables in the database:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| chunk_metadata | Referenced by the `chunk_id` foreign key |
| files | Referenced by the `file_id` foreign key |

## Error Handling
The script does not include explicit error handling. Any errors during execution (e.g., if the referenced tables don't exist) will be handled by the database management system.

## TODOs
The script includes a comment at the top:
```sql
-- This file should undo anything in `up.sql`
```
This serves as a reminder that the purpose of this `down.sql` file is to reverse the changes made in the corresponding `up.sql` file.
