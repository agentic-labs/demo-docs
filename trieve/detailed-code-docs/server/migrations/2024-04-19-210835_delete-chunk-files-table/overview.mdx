## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for deleting the `chunk_files` table from the database schema. It includes both the "up" migration to remove the table and the "down" migration to recreate it if needed. These migrations are part of a database schema change, likely related to restructuring how chunk and file relationships are managed in the application.

## What does it do?
The migration scripts in this directory perform the following actions:

1. The "up" migration (up.sql):
   - Removes the `chunk_files` table from the database schema.
   - This action deletes all data stored in the `chunk_files` table and removes its structure from the database.

2. The "down" migration (down.sql):
   - Recreates the `chunk_files` table with its original structure.
   - Defines the table with columns for `id`, `chunk_id`, `file_id`, `created_at`, and `updated_at`.
   - Establishes foreign key relationships between `chunk_files` and the `chunk_metadata` and `files` tables.

These migrations allow the development team to apply or revert changes to the database schema related to the `chunk_files` table. This is useful for managing database versions, rolling back changes if needed, and ensuring consistency across different environments.

## Key Files

1. up.sql
   - Purpose: Defines the forward migration to remove the `chunk_files` table.
   - Content: Contains a single SQL statement to drop the `chunk_files` table.
   - Example:
     ```sql
     DROP TABLE chunk_files;
     ```

2. down.sql
   - Purpose: Defines the reverse migration to recreate the `chunk_files` table if the changes need to be reverted.
   - Content: Contains SQL statements to recreate the `chunk_files` table with its original structure and constraints.
   - Example:
     ```sql
     CREATE TABLE chunk_files (
         id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
         chunk_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES chunk_metadata(id) ON UPDATE CASCADE ON DELETE CASCADE,
         file_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES files(id) ON UPDATE CASCADE ON DELETE CASCADE,
         created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
         updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
     );

     ALTER TABLE chunk_files ADD CONSTRAINT chunk_files_chunk_id_fkey FOREIGN KEY (chunk_id) REFERENCES chunk_metadata(id) ON UPDATE CASCADE ON DELETE CASCADE;
     ALTER TABLE chunk_files ADD CONSTRAINT chunk_files_file_id_fkey FOREIGN KEY (file_id) REFERENCES files(id) ON UPDATE CASCADE ON DELETE CASCADE;
     ```

## Configuration
The migration scripts do not require any additional configuration. However, the following points should be noted:

1. Database Compatibility: These migrations are written in SQL and should be compatible with PostgreSQL databases, as evidenced by the use of UUID data types and timestamp with time zone.

2. Migration Naming Convention: The directory name follows a specific format: `YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS_description`. In this case, it's `2024-04-19-210835_delete-chunk-files-table`, indicating that this migration was created on April 19, 2024, at 21:08:35, with the purpose of deleting the chunk_files table.

3. Migration Framework: These scripts are likely intended to be run by a database migration tool or framework, which would handle the execution order and tracking of applied migrations.

4. Cascading Effects: The foreign key constraints in the down migration are set to CASCADE for both UPDATE and DELETE operations. This means that changes or deletions in the referenced tables (chunk_metadata and files) will propagate to the chunk_files table.

5. Timestamp Columns: The `created_at` and `updated_at` columns in the down migration are automatically set to the current timestamp when a record is inserted or updated, respectively.

When applying these migrations, developers and database administrators should be aware of the potential data loss when running the up migration, as it permanently removes the `chunk_files` table and all its contents. Proper backups and testing in non-production environments are recommended before applying these changes to a production database.
