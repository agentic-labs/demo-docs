## High-level description
This SQL migration script is designed to remove the `chunk_files` table from the database. It's a simple, straightforward operation that drops the specified table entirely.

## Symbols

### DROP TABLE chunk_files;
#### Description
This SQL command is used to completely remove the `chunk_files` table from the database schema.

#### Internal Logic
The `DROP TABLE` statement is a Data Definition Language (DDL) command in SQL that removes a table and all its data from the database. When executed:

1. The table structure is removed from the database schema.
2. All data stored in the table is permanently deleted.
3. Any associated indexes, triggers, or constraints related to this table are also removed.

## Side Effects
- Permanent deletion of the `chunk_files` table and all its contents.
- Potential impact on any database objects (views, stored procedures, etc.) that reference the `chunk_files` table.
- Possible effects on application code that relies on the existence of this table.

## Performance Considerations
Dropping a table is generally a fast operation, especially for smaller tables. However, for very large tables or in busy database systems, this operation might cause a brief lock on the database, potentially affecting concurrent operations.

## Error Handling
This script does not include explicit error handling. If the `chunk_files` table doesn't exist when this script is run, it will likely result in an SQL error. It's important to ensure that this migration is run in the correct order and that the table exists before attempting to drop it.

## TODOs
Consider adding error handling or a conditional check to ensure the table exists before attempting to drop it, such as:

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS chunk_files;
```

This would prevent errors if the table has already been dropped or never existed.
