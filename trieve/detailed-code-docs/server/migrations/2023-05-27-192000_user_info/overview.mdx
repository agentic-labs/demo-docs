## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for modifying the `users` table in a database. The migration, identified as `2023-05-27-192000_user_info`, adds new columns to store additional user information and provides a mechanism to revert these changes if needed.

## What does it do?
The migration scripts in this directory perform the following actions:

1. Add new columns to the `users` table:
   - `username`: A unique text field to store the user's username.
   - `website`: A text field to store the user's website URL.
   - `visible_email`: A boolean field to indicate whether the user's email should be visible.

2. Set the `visible_email` field to `true` for all existing users.

3. Provide a way to undo these changes by removing the newly added columns if necessary.

These changes allow the application to store and manage additional user information, such as usernames and website URLs, and provide control over email visibility.

## Key Files

### up.sql
This file contains the SQL commands to apply the migration:

```sql
ALTER TABLE users
ADD COLUMN username TEXT NULL UNIQUE,
ADD COLUMN website TEXT NULL,
ADD COLUMN visible_email BOOLEAN DEFAULT false NOT NULL;

UPDATE users
SET visible_email = true;
```

The script adds three new columns to the `users` table and sets the `visible_email` column to `true` for all existing users.

### down.sql
This file contains the SQL commands to revert the migration:

```sql
ALTER TABLE users
DROP COLUMN username,
DROP COLUMN website,
DROP COLUMN visible_email;
```

The script removes the three columns added by the `up.sql` migration.

## Configuration
The migration is identified by its timestamp: `2023-05-27-192000`. This timestamp is used to order migrations and ensure they are applied in the correct sequence.

## Dependencies
This migration depends on:
1. The existence of a `users` table in the database.
2. A database system that supports ALTER TABLE operations for adding and dropping columns.
3. A migration framework or tool that can execute these SQL scripts in the appropriate order.

## Side Effects
When applying this migration:
1. The `users` table schema will be modified, which may require table locks during the operation.
2. All existing users will have their `visible_email` set to `true`, potentially changing the visibility of their email addresses in the application.
3. The `username` column is set as UNIQUE, which may impact user registration or profile update processes in the application.

When reverting this migration:
1. Any data stored in the `username`, `website`, and `visible_email` columns will be permanently lost.
2. Applications or queries relying on these columns will need to be updated to prevent errors.

It's important to note that these migrations should be tested in a non-production environment before being applied to a live database to ensure data integrity and application compatibility.
