## High-level description
This SQL migration file is designed to revert the changes made in the corresponding `up.sql` file. It removes three columns (`username`, `website`, and `visible_email`) from the `users` table in the database.

### SQL Statement
#### Description
The SQL statement in this file is an `ALTER TABLE` command that modifies the structure of the `users` table by removing three columns.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `ALTER TABLE` command targets the `users` table.
2. It uses the `DROP COLUMN` clause three times to remove the following columns:
   - `username`
   - `website`
   - `visible_email`

## Side Effects
Executing this SQL statement will permanently remove the specified columns and their data from the `users` table. This action is irreversible and will result in the loss of any information stored in these columns.

## Performance Considerations
Dropping columns from a large table can be a resource-intensive operation, especially if the table contains a significant amount of data. It may temporarily lock the table, potentially affecting database performance during execution.

## Dependencies
This migration file is likely part of a database migration system, possibly using tools like Diesel for Rust or other similar ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) libraries that support database migrations.

## TODOs
The comment at the top of the file, `-- This file should undo anything in `up.sql``, suggests that there is a corresponding `up.sql` file that originally added these columns. It's important to ensure that this `down.sql` file correctly reverses all changes made in the `up.sql` file to maintain database consistency during migrations.
