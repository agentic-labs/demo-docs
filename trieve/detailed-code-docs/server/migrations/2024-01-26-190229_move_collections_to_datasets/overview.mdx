## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for moving collections from being associated with users to being associated with datasets. The migration is identified as "2024-01-26-190229_move_collections_to_datasets", suggesting it was created on January 26, 2024, at 19:02:29. The directory includes two SQL files: `up.sql` for applying the migration and `down.sql` for reverting it.

## What does it do?
This migration restructures the database to change how collections are associated within the system. Previously, collections were directly linked to users. After this migration, collections become associated with datasets instead. This change affects several tables and involves the following key actions:

1. Removing the direct link between collections and users by dropping the `author_id` column from the `chunk_collection` table.
2. Renaming the `user_collection_counts` table to `dataset_collection_counts` to reflect the new association.
3. Updating the `update_collection_counts` trigger function to work with the new schema, maintaining counts based on dataset associations rather than user associations.
4. Providing a way to revert these changes if needed, allowing the system to switch back to the previous user-based collection association.

This migration likely represents a significant shift in how the application manages and organizes collections, moving from a user-centric model to a dataset-centric one.

## Key Files

### up.sql
This file contains the SQL commands to apply the migration. Key actions include:
- Removing the `author_id` column from the `chunk_collection` table.
- Dropping the `user_id` column and adding a `dataset_id` column to the `user_collection_counts` table.
- Renaming `user_collection_counts` to `dataset_collection_counts`.
- Updating the `update_collection_counts` trigger function to work with the new schema.

Example of a key change:
```sql
ALTER TABLE chunk_collection DROP COLUMN author_id;
```

### down.sql
This file contains the SQL commands to revert the migration. Key actions include:
- Adding back the `author_id` column to the `chunk_collection` table.
- Adding back the `user_id` column to the `user_collection_counts` table.
- Removing the `dataset_id` column from the `chunk_collection` table.
- Renaming `dataset_collection_counts` back to `user_collection_counts`.

Example of a key reversion:
```sql
ALTER TABLE chunk_collections ADD COLUMN author_id uuid;
```

## Configuration
This migration does not appear to use any external configuration files or environment variables. The changes are defined entirely within the SQL scripts.

The migration relies on the following database objects:
- Tables: `chunk_collection`, `user_collection_counts` (renamed to `dataset_collection_counts`)
- Function: `update_collection_counts`

It's important to note that this migration may require corresponding changes in the application code that interacts with these database objects to ensure compatibility with the new schema.
