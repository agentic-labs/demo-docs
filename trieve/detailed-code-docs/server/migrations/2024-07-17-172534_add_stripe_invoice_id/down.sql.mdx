title: "down.sql"

## High-level description
This SQL script reverts the database migration defined in the corresponding `up.sql` file. Specifically, it removes the `stripe_id` column from the `stripe_invoices` table. This suggests that the `up.sql` migration likely added this column, and this script undoes that change.

## Symbols

### `ALTER TABLE stripe_invoices`
#### Description
This SQL statement modifies the existing `stripe_invoices` table.

#### Internal Logic
It uses the `DROP COLUMN` clause to remove the `stripe_id` column from the table. This operation is irreversible, meaning any data previously stored in the `stripe_id` column will be permanently deleted. 

### `DROP COLUMN stripe_id;`
#### Description
This clause specifies that the column named `stripe_id` should be removed from the table.
