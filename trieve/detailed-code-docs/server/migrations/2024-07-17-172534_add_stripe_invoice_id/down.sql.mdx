## High-level description
This SQL script defines a database migration that reverts a change made by the corresponding `up.sql` migration. Specifically, it removes the `stripe_id` column from the `stripe_invoices` table.

## Symbols

### `ALTER TABLE stripe_invoices DROP COLUMN stripe_id;`
#### Description
This SQL statement removes the `stripe_id` column from the `stripe_invoices` table. This action is intended to undo a previous migration that likely added this column.

#### Internal Logic
- **`ALTER TABLE stripe_invoices`**: This clause specifies that the `stripe_invoices` table is being modified.
- **`DROP COLUMN stripe_id`**: This clause instructs the database to remove the column named `stripe_id`.

#### Side Effects
- **Data Loss**: Removing a column from a table results in the permanent loss of all data stored in that column. 

#### Performance Considerations
Dropping a column can be a time-consuming operation, especially for large tables. It's crucial to have appropriate backups and downtime planned before executing this migration in a production environment.
