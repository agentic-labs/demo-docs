## High-level description
This SQL script adds a new column named `stripe_id` to the `stripe_invoices` table. This likely aims to store an identifier from the Stripe API, enhancing the integration between the application and Stripe for managing invoices.

## Symbols

### `ALTER TABLE stripe_invoices`
#### Description
This SQL statement modifies the existing `stripe_invoices` table by adding a new column.

#### Internal Logic
- `ALTER TABLE`: This command is used to modify the structure of an existing table.
- `stripe_invoices`: This is the name of the table being modified.
- `ADD COLUMN stripe_id TEXT`: This part of the statement adds a new column named `stripe_id` to the table. The data type of the column is set to `TEXT`, indicating it will store text-based data.

#### Side Effects
- **Schema Change:** This script directly modifies the database schema by adding a new column to the `stripe_invoices` table. 

## Dependencies
- **Database System:** This script assumes the use of a SQL database system, but the specific dialect (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) is not explicitly defined within the provided code snippet.
