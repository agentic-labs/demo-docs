## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for modifying the `stripe_invoices` table in a database. The migration adds a new column `stripe_id` to store Stripe-specific invoice identifiers, enhancing the integration with Stripe's billing services.

## What does it do?
The migration scripts in this directory perform the following actions:

1. Add a new column: The `up.sql` script adds a new column called `stripe_id` to the `stripe_invoices` table. This column is of type TEXT, which means it can store alphanumeric strings. This addition allows the system to store Stripe-specific invoice identifiers, improving the integration with Stripe's billing system.

2. Provide a rollback mechanism: The `down.sql` script provides a way to undo the changes made by the `up.sql` script. It removes the `stripe_id` column from the `stripe_invoices` table, effectively reverting the database to its state before the migration was applied.

These scripts enable database administrators or developers to easily apply or revert changes to the database structure, specifically related to Stripe invoice handling.

## Key Files

1. `up.sql`:
   This file contains the SQL command to add the `stripe_id` column to the `stripe_invoices` table. Here's the content of the file:

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE stripe_invoices
   ADD COLUMN stripe_id TEXT;
   ```

   This script modifies the existing `stripe_invoices` table by adding a new TEXT column named `stripe_id`. This column is likely intended to store the unique identifier for each invoice as provided by the Stripe API.

2. `down.sql`:
   This file contains the SQL command to remove the `stripe_id` column from the `stripe_invoices` table. Here's the content of the file:

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE stripe_invoices
   DROP COLUMN stripe_id;
   ```

   This script reverts the changes made by the `up.sql` script. It removes the `stripe_id` column from the `stripe_invoices` table, effectively undoing the migration.

These files work together to provide a reversible database migration. The `up.sql` script applies the change, while the `down.sql` script allows for rolling back the change if needed. This approach is common in database migration systems, allowing for version control of database schemas and easy application or reversal of changes.

## Configuration
The migration is identified by its timestamp: `2024-07-17-172534`. This timestamp is likely used by the migration system to track which migrations have been applied and in what order. The format appears to be:

- Year: 2024
- Month: 07 (July)
- Day: 17
- Time: 17:25:34 (5:25:34 PM)

This naming convention ensures that migrations are applied in the correct order and helps prevent conflicts between different migrations.
