title: "down.sql"

## High-level description
This SQL migration script is designed to undo the changes made in the corresponding `up.sql` file. It removes a trigger and a function related to updating a tsvector column in the `card_metadata` table.

## Symbols

### DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS update_tsvector_trigger ON card_metadata
#### Description
This SQL command removes the trigger named `update_tsvector_trigger` from the `card_metadata` table if it exists.

#### Internal Logic
- The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the command doesn't throw an error if the trigger doesn't exist.
- The trigger is specifically removed from the `card_metadata` table.

### DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS update_tsvector()
#### Description
This SQL command removes the function named `update_tsvector()` if it exists in the database.

#### Internal Logic
- The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the command doesn't throw an error if the function doesn't exist.
- The function is dropped without specifying any parameters, which means it will drop all functions with this name regardless of their parameter list.

## Side Effects
- Removes the `update_tsvector_trigger` trigger from the `card_metadata` table, which likely means that automatic updates to a tsvector column will no longer occur.
- Removes the `update_tsvector()` function from the database, potentially affecting other parts of the application that might have been using this function.

## Dependencies
This script doesn't explicitly depend on any external libraries or modules, as it's pure SQL.

## Error Handling
The script uses `IF EXISTS` clauses to prevent errors if the trigger or function doesn't exist when trying to drop them. This makes the migration more robust and idempotent.

## Notes
1. This is a database migration "down" script, meant to revert changes made by a corresponding "up" migration.
2. The script assumes that the `card_metadata` table exists in the database.
3. The order of operations is important: the trigger is dropped before the function, as the trigger likely depends on the function.
4. After running this script, any functionality that depended on the automatic updating of a tsvector column in the `card_metadata` table will no longer work.
5. It's important to ensure that this script accurately undoes all changes made in the corresponding `up.sql` file to maintain database consistency across migrations.
