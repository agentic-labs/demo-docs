## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for updating a tsvector column in the `card_metadata` table. The migration adds functionality to automatically update a full-text search index when new records are inserted into the table. The directory includes both "up" and "down" migration scripts to apply and revert these changes, respectively.

## What does it do?
The migration scripts in this directory implement an automatic update mechanism for a full-text search index in a database table called `card_metadata`. Here's a breakdown of what it does:

1. When a new record is inserted into the `card_metadata` table, a trigger automatically fires.
2. This trigger calls a custom function that creates a tsvector (text search vector) from the content of the new record.
3. The generated tsvector is then stored in a dedicated column named `card_metadata_tsvector`.
4. This process enables efficient full-text search capabilities on the `content` column of the `card_metadata` table.

The "up" migration script sets up this functionality, while the "down" migration script removes it, allowing for easy application and reversal of these database changes.

## Key Files

### up.sql
This file contains the SQL commands to implement the tsvector update functionality:

1. It creates a function called `update_tsvector()` that generates a tsvector from the `content` column of a new row.
2. It sets up a trigger named `update_tsvector_trigger` that calls this function before each INSERT operation on the `card_metadata` table.

Here's a simplified version of the function:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_tsvector() RETURNS trigger AS $$
BEGIN
  NEW.card_metadata_tsvector := to_tsvector('english', NEW.content);
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

And the trigger:

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER update_tsvector_trigger
BEFORE INSERT ON card_metadata
FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION update_tsvector();
```

### down.sql
This file contains the SQL commands to revert the changes made by `up.sql`:

1. It drops the `update_tsvector_trigger` from the `card_metadata` table.
2. It drops the `update_tsvector()` function.

Here are the commands:

```sql
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS update_tsvector_trigger ON card_metadata;
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS update_tsvector();
```

## Dependencies
The migration scripts rely on PostgreSQL-specific features:

- PostgreSQL: The scripts use PostgreSQL-specific syntax and functions, such as `to_tsvector` and `LANGUAGE plpgsql`.

## Configuration
These migration scripts don't require any external configuration. They operate on the assumption that:

1. A database table named `card_metadata` exists.
2. This table has a `content` column that contains the text to be indexed.
3. There's a `card_metadata_tsvector` column to store the generated tsvector.

## Performance Considerations
While this migration enhances search capabilities, it's worth noting that:

1. The trigger will slightly impact the performance of INSERT operations on the `card_metadata` table.
2. The trade-off between real-time search index updates and insert performance is generally acceptable for maintaining up-to-date search capabilities.
3. If insert performance becomes a bottleneck, alternative strategies like batch updates or asynchronous indexing might be considered in the future.
