## High-level description
This SQL migration script renames the `tag_set_array` column to `tag_set` in three tables: `chunk_metadata`, `files`, and `chunk_group`. It also drops the existing `tag_set` column from these tables before the renaming operation.

### SQL Migration Script
#### Description
This script performs a series of ALTER TABLE operations to modify the structure of three tables: `chunk_metadata`, `files`, and `chunk_group`. The main purpose is to standardize the column name for tag sets across these tables.

#### Internal Logic
The script follows these steps for each table:
1. Drops the existing `tag_set` column.
2. Renames the `tag_set_array` column to `tag_set`.

This process is repeated for all three tables in the following order:
1. `chunk_metadata`
2. `files`
3. `chunk_group`

## Side Effects
- The `tag_set` column is permanently removed from all three tables.
- The `tag_set_array` column is renamed to `tag_set` in all three tables.
- Any data that was present in the original `tag_set` columns will be lost.
- Applications or queries that were using the `tag_set_array` column will need to be updated to use the new `tag_set` column name.

## Performance Considerations
Depending on the size of the tables and the database system being used, this migration might take some time to complete, especially if the tables contain a large number of rows. It's advisable to run this migration during a maintenance window or a period of low database activity.

## Error Handling
This script does not include explicit error handling. If any of the operations fail, the database system will likely roll back the entire transaction, leaving the database in its original state.

## TODOs
The comment "-- Your SQL goes here" at the beginning of the file suggests that this might be a template or placeholder for the actual migration script. Ensure that this comment is removed or replaced with appropriate documentation before finalizing the migration.
