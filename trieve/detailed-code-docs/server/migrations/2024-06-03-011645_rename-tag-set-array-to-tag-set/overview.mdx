## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for renaming the `tag_set_array` column to `tag_set` in multiple tables of a database schema. The migration affects three tables: `chunk_metadata`, `files`, and `chunk_group`. The directory includes both "up" and "down" migration scripts to allow for applying and reverting the changes.

## What does it do?
The migration scripts in this directory perform a database schema change across three tables: `chunk_metadata`, `files`, and `chunk_group`. The main action is to rename the `tag_set_array` column to `tag_set` in each of these tables. 

In the process, the existing `tag_set` column is dropped from each table before the renaming occurs. This suggests that the database is transitioning from having two separate columns (`tag_set` and `tag_set_array`) to having a single `tag_set` column that likely combines the functionality of both.

The "up" migration applies these changes, while the "down" migration reverts them, ensuring that the database can be rolled back to its previous state if needed.

## Key Files

### up.sql
This file contains the SQL statements to apply the migration. For each of the three tables (`chunk_metadata`, `files`, and `chunk_group`), it performs two operations:

1. Drops the existing `tag_set` column:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE table_name DROP COLUMN tag_set;
   ```

2. Renames the `tag_set_array` column to `tag_set`:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE table_name RENAME COLUMN tag_set_array TO tag_set;
   ```

### down.sql
This file contains the SQL statements to revert the migration. For each of the three tables, it performs two operations:

1. Renames the `tag_set` column back to `tag_set_array`:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE table_name RENAME COLUMN tag_set TO tag_set_array;
   ```

2. Adds a new `tag_set` column with a default value of NULL:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE table_name ADD COLUMN tag_set TEXT DEFAULT NULL;
   ```

These scripts ensure that the database schema can be updated or reverted as needed, maintaining flexibility in the development process.

## Configuration
The migration is identified by its timestamp and description in the directory name: `2024-06-03-011645_rename-tag-set-array-to-tag-set`. This naming convention is likely used by a database migration tool to track which migrations have been applied and in what order.

No additional configuration files or environment variables are specified in this directory. The migration relies solely on the SQL scripts to perform the necessary changes to the database schema.
