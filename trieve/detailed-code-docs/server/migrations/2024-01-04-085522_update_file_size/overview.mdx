## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for updating the file size tracking mechanism in a database. It consists of two files: `up.sql` for applying the changes and `down.sql` for rolling them back. The migration introduces a new trigger and function to automatically update file storage counts for organizations whenever files are inserted, updated, or deleted.

## What does it do?
The migration enhances the database's ability to track file storage usage per organization. It creates a system where:

1. Whenever a file is added, updated, or deleted in the `files` table, the total file storage for the associated organization is automatically recalculated.
2. This recalculation is done through a trigger that fires after each relevant operation on the `files` table.
3. The trigger calls a function that updates the `file_storage` column in the `organization_usage_counts` table, ensuring it always reflects the current total size of files for each organization.

This automated process eliminates the need for manual updates or separate processes to keep track of file storage usage, providing real-time accuracy in storage tracking.

## Key Files

### up.sql
This file contains the SQL commands to apply the migration:

1. It defines a function `update_files_storage_counts_with_update()` that handles the logic for updating the `file_storage` column in the `organization_usage_counts` table.
2. It creates a trigger `update_files_storage_with_update_trigger` on the `files` table that calls this function after INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE operations.

The function's logic is as follows:
- For INSERT: It adds the new file's size to the organization's total storage.
- For UPDATE: It subtracts the old file size and adds the new file size.
- For DELETE: It subtracts the deleted file's size from the total.

Here's a simplified version of the function:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_files_storage_counts_with_update() RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  IF (TG_OP = 'INSERT') THEN
    -- Add new file size to organization's storage
  ELSIF (TG_OP = 'UPDATE') THEN
    -- Subtract old file size and add new file size
  ELSIF (TG_OP = 'DELETE') THEN
    -- Subtract deleted file size
  END IF;
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

### down.sql
This file contains the SQL commands to revert the migration:

1. It drops the trigger `update_files_storage_with_update_trigger` from the `files` table.
2. It drops the function `update_files_storage_counts_with_update()`.

```sql
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS update_files_storage_with_update_trigger ON files;
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS update_files_storage_counts_with_update();
```

## Configuration
This migration doesn't require any specific configuration. However, it assumes the existence of:

1. A `files` table with columns:
   - `id`
   - `size`
   - `organization_id`
2. An `organization_usage_counts` table with columns:
   - `organization_id`
   - `file_storage`

The migration will automatically update these tables when applied.

## Dependencies
This migration relies on PostgreSQL-specific features:

1. PL/pgSQL language for writing the trigger function.
2. PostgreSQL's trigger mechanism.
3. The `GREATEST` function for ensuring non-negative values.

While no specific version is mentioned, these features are available in PostgreSQL 9.1 and later versions.
