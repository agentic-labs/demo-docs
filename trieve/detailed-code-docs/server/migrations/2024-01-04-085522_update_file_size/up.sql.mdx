## High-level description
This SQL script updates the database schema by creating a trigger named `update_files_storage_with_update_trigger` on the `files` table. This trigger automatically updates the `file_storage` column in the `organization_usage_counts` table whenever a file is inserted, updated, or deleted in the `files` table. 

This ensures that the `file_storage` accurately reflects the total size of files associated with each organization.

## Code Structure
The code defines a PostgreSQL function `update_files_storage_counts_with_update()` which is used as the trigger function. It then drops any existing triggers or functions with the same names and finally creates the new trigger `update_files_storage_with_update_trigger` that calls the defined function.

### `update_files_storage_counts_with_update()`
#### Description
This function is a PostgreSQL trigger function that is executed automatically after an INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE operation on the `files` table. It updates the `file_storage` column in the `organization_usage_counts` table based on the operation performed.

#### Inputs
This function implicitly receives its input from the `files` table trigger. The following variables are available within the function:

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `NEW` | Record | Represents the new state of the row being inserted or updated in the `files` table. |
| `OLD` | Record | Represents the old state of the row being updated or deleted in the `files` table. |
| `TG_OP` | Text | Represents the type of operation being performed (INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE). |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `NEW` | Record | Returns the `NEW` record, which represents the new state of the row in the `files` table after the trigger has been executed. |

#### Internal Logic
1. **Determine operation type:** The function first checks the value of `TG_OP` to determine if the triggering event is an INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE operation.
2. **INSERT operation:** If it's an INSERT, it inserts a new row into `organization_usage_counts` with the organization's ID and the new file's size. If a row for the organization already exists, it updates the existing row by adding the new file's size to the current `file_storage` value.
3. **UPDATE operation:** If it's an UPDATE, it updates the `file_storage` for the corresponding organization by subtracting the old file size (`OLD.size`) and adding the new file size (`NEW.size`). It uses `GREATEST(0, ...)` to ensure the `file_storage` doesn't become negative.
4. **DELETE operation:** If it's a DELETE, it updates the `file_storage` for the corresponding organization by subtracting the deleted file's size (`OLD.size`) from the current value. It uses a CASE statement to ensure that `file_storage` doesn't become negative if the deleted file size is greater than the current `file_storage` value.

### `update_files_storage_with_update_trigger`
#### Description
This is a PostgreSQL trigger that is defined on the `files` table. It is set to fire after an INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE operation on the table. 

#### Internal Logic
The trigger executes the `update_files_storage_counts_with_update()` function for each row affected by the triggering operation. This ensures that the `organization_usage_counts` table is updated correctly to reflect the changes in file storage caused by the operation on the `files` table.
