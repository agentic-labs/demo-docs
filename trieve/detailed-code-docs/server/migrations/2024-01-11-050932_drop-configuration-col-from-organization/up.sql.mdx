## High-level description
This SQL migration script removes the 'configuration' column from the 'organizations' table in the database. It's a simple alteration that drops a specific column, likely as part of a database schema update.

## Symbols

### ALTER table organizations DROP COLUMN configuration;
#### Description
This SQL statement modifies the structure of the 'organizations' table by removing the 'configuration' column.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `ALTER TABLE` command is used to modify an existing table structure.
2. `organizations` is the name of the table being altered.
3. `DROP COLUMN` is the specific alteration being made, which removes a column from the table.
4. `configuration` is the name of the column being removed from the table.

## Side Effects
- The 'configuration' column and all its data will be permanently removed from the 'organizations' table.
- Any queries or application code that previously relied on the 'configuration' column will need to be updated to reflect this change.
- The storage space used by the 'configuration' column will be freed up in the database.

## Performance Considerations
- This operation may lock the table for the duration of the column removal, which could impact database performance temporarily, especially for large tables.
- The execution time of this migration will depend on the size of the 'organizations' table and the database system being used.

## Dependencies
This migration script likely depends on:
