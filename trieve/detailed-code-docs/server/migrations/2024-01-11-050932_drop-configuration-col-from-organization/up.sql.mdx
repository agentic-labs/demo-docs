## High-level description
This SQL migration script removes the 'configuration' column from the 'organizations' table in the database. It's part of a database schema change, likely to update the structure of the organizations table by eliminating a previously existing column.

## Symbols

### ALTER table organizations DROP COLUMN configuration;
#### Description
This SQL statement alters the 'organizations' table by dropping (removing) the 'configuration' column.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `ALTER TABLE` command is used to modify an existing table structure.
2. `organizations` is the name of the table being altered.
3. `DROP COLUMN` is the specific alteration being made, which removes a column from the table.
4. `configuration` is the name of the column being removed from the table.

## Side Effects
- The 'configuration' column and all its data will be permanently removed from the 'organizations' table.
- Any queries, views, or application code that previously relied on the 'configuration' column will need to be updated to reflect this change.
- The storage space used by the 'configuration' column will be freed up in the database.

## References
This migration script is related to the earlier migration that created the 'organizations' table, as seen in the file '2023-12-05-152011_add-organizations-table/up.sql'. The original table creation included the 'configuration' column of type JSONB, which is now being removed by this migration.

## TODOs
It's important to note that this is an "up" migration. There should be a corresponding "down" migration script that would add the 'configuration' column back to the table if the migration needs to be reversed. This "down" migration is not provided in the given code snippets but should exist in the project structure.

Additionally, any application code that was using the 'configuration' column will need to be updated to handle its absence. This might include:
1. Removing any references to the 'configuration' column in queries
2. Updating any ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) models or schemas
3. Modifying any business logic that depended on the 'configuration' data
4. Updating any API endpoints that returned or accepted 'configuration' data

These tasks are not explicitly mentioned in the migration script but are implied by the nature of the change being made.
