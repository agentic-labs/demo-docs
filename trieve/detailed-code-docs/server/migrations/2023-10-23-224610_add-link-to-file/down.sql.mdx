title: "down.sql"
---

## High-level description
This SQL migration file is designed to undo the changes made in the corresponding `up.sql` file. Specifically, it removes the `link` column from the `files` table in the database.

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE files DROP COLUMN link;
#### Description
This SQL statement modifies the structure of the `files` table by removing the `link` column.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `ALTER TABLE` command is used to modify the structure of an existing table.
2. `files` is the name of the table being altered.
3. `DROP COLUMN` is used to remove a column from the table.
4. `link` is the name of the column being removed.

## Side Effects
Executing this migration will permanently remove the `link` column from the `files` table, along with any data stored in that column. This action cannot be undone unless a backup of the data is available or the corresponding `up.sql` migration is re-run.

## Dependencies
This migration file is part of a database migration system, likely using a tool such as Diesel for Rust or a similar ORM/migration tool for another language.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this SQL statement. If the `link` column does not exist in the `files` table when this migration is run, it will likely result in an SQL error.

## Notes
1. This is a "down" migration file, as indicated by its filename (`down.sql`). It is intended to revert changes made by the corresponding "up" migration.
2. The comment at the top of the file serves as a reminder of the file's purpose, which is to undo the changes made in the `up.sql` file.
3. Care should be taken when running this migration, as it will result in data loss if the `link` column contains any information.
4. It's important to ensure that any application code or other database operations that rely on the `link` column are updated accordingly before running this migration.
