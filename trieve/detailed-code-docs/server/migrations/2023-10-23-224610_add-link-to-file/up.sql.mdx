## High-level description
This SQL migration file adds a new column named 'link' to the 'files' table. The column is designed to store text data and is nullable, with a default value of NULL.

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE files
#### Description
This SQL command modifies the structure of the existing 'files' table by adding a new column.

#### Internal Logic
1. Targets the 'files' table for modification.
2. Adds a new column named 'link'.
3. Sets the data type of the new column to 'text'.
4. Allows NULL values in the column.
5. Sets the default value of the column to NULL.

## Side Effects
- This migration will modify the schema of the 'files' table in the database.
- Existing rows in the 'files' table will have a NULL value in the new 'link' column.
- Any applications or queries that rely on the structure of the 'files' table may need to be updated to accommodate the new column.

## Performance Considerations
- Adding a new column to an existing table with a large number of rows might take some time to execute, depending on the database size and system resources.
- The operation does not require data conversion or manipulation of existing rows, which helps minimize the performance impact.

## TODOs
Consider adding an index on the 'link' column if it will be frequently used in WHERE clauses or JOIN operations to improve query performance.
