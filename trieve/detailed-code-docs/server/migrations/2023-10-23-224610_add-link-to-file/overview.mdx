## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration files for adding a new 'link' column to the 'files' table in the database. It consists of two files: an 'up.sql' file for applying the change and a 'down.sql' file for reverting it. These migrations are part of a database versioning system, likely using a tool such as Diesel for Rust or a similar ORM/migration tool.

## What does it do?
The migration in this directory modifies the structure of the 'files' table in the database. It adds a new column called 'link' that can store text data. This column is optional (nullable) and will have a default value of NULL. 

If for any reason the change needs to be undone, the 'down' migration removes this 'link' column from the 'files' table. This process ensures that database changes can be tracked, applied, and reversed in a controlled manner.

## Key Files

1. `up.sql`: This file contains the SQL command to add the 'link' column to the 'files' table. Here's the content:

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE files
   ADD COLUMN link text NULL DEFAULT NULL;
   ```

   This command modifies the 'files' table by adding a new 'link' column of type text, which can contain NULL values and defaults to NULL if no value is specified.

2. `down.sql`: This file contains the SQL command to remove the 'link' column from the 'files' table. Here's the content:

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE files DROP COLUMN link;
   ```

   This command removes the 'link' column from the 'files' table, effectively undoing the change made by the 'up' migration.

## Dependencies
This migration relies on the existence of a 'files' table in the database. It's part of a larger database schema management system, likely using a migration tool compatible with SQL databases.

## Configuration
The migration is identified by its timestamp in the directory name: '2023-10-23-224610'. This timestamp ensures that migrations are applied in the correct order and helps in tracking when changes were made to the database schema.

## Notes
1. The 'up' migration adds flexibility to the 'files' table by introducing a new 'link' column. This could be used to store URLs, file paths, or any other text-based link associated with each file entry.

2. The 'down' migration should be used with caution, as it will permanently remove the 'link' column and any data it contains. It's crucial to ensure that no critical data will be lost before applying this migration.

3. When applying these migrations, it's important to update any application code or database queries that interact with the 'files' table to account for the new 'link' column.

4. If the 'link' column is expected to be frequently used in WHERE clauses or JOIN operations, consider adding an index to improve query performance. This could be done in a separate migration or by modifying the 'up.sql' file.

5. The use of NULL as the default value for the 'link' column allows for backward compatibility with existing rows in the 'files' table, as they will automatically have NULL in the new column after the migration is applied.

6. These migrations demonstrate good database management practices by providing a way to both apply and revert changes, enabling easier maintenance and version control of the database schema.
