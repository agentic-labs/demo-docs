## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for adding a new `link` column to the `files` table in a database. It includes both an "up" script to apply the change and a "down" script to revert it, following a common pattern in database migration systems.

## What does it do?
These scripts modify the structure of a database table called `files`. The main action is to add a new column called `link` to this table. This column is designed to store text data, which could be used to hold URLs or references to file locations. 

The "up" script adds this new column, allowing it to contain null values and setting its default value to null. This means that when the column is added, existing rows in the table won't be affected, and new rows will have this field empty by default unless a value is specifically provided.

The "down" script does the opposite - it removes the `link` column from the `files` table. This is useful if you need to undo the changes made by the "up" script, reverting the table to its previous state without the `link` column.

## Key Files

1. `up.sql`: This file contains the SQL command to add the `link` column to the `files` table. The command is:

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE files ADD COLUMN link text NULL DEFAULT NULL;
   ```

   This adds a new column named `link` of type `text`, which can contain null values and defaults to null.

2. `down.sql`: This file contains the SQL command to remove the `link` column from the `files` table. The command is:

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE files DROP COLUMN link;
   ```

   This removes the `link` column, effectively undoing the change made by the `up.sql` script.

These scripts are typically used in pairs as part of a database migration system, allowing developers to apply changes to the database schema in a controlled and reversible manner.

## Configuration
The migration is identified by a timestamp in the directory name: `2023-10-23-224610`. This timestamp likely corresponds to when the migration was created and helps to order migrations chronologically.

No additional configuration files or environment variables are used in this directory. The SQL scripts are designed to be run directly on the database as part of a migration process.

It's important to note that these scripts assume the existence of a `files` table in the database. The successful execution of these scripts depends on the current state of the database schema and the presence of the `files` table.
