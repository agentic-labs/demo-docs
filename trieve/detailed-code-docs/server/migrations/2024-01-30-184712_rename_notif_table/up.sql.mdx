## High-level description
This SQL migration script renames the `file_upload_completed_notifications` table to `events`, removes two columns, and adds two new columns. The changes transform a specific notification table into a more generic events table, allowing for different types of events with associated data.

### SQL Migration Script
#### Description
This script performs a series of ALTER TABLE operations to modify the structure of an existing database table.

#### Internal Logic
1. Renames the `file_upload_completed_notifications` table to `events`.
2. Drops the `user_read` column from the newly renamed `events` table.
3. Drops the `group_uuid` column from the `events` table.
4. Adds a new `event_type` column of type VARCHAR(255) to the `events` table.
5. Adds a new `event_data` column of type JSONB to the `events` table.

## Side Effects
- The `file_upload_completed_notifications` table will no longer exist after this migration.
- Any existing data in the `user_read` and `group_uuid` columns will be permanently deleted.
- The table structure is changed, which may affect any queries or application code that relies on the old structure.

## Performance Considerations
- Renaming a table is generally a quick operation in most databases.
- Dropping columns is usually fast, but may take longer if there are many rows or indexes on those columns.
- Adding new columns can be slower, especially for large tables, as the database needs to update all existing rows.
- The JSONB data type for `event_data` allows for efficient storage and querying of JSON data, but may have performance implications for very large JSON objects.

## TODOs
Consider adding appropriate indexes on the new `event_type` and `event_data` columns to optimize query performance, depending on how these columns will be used in the application.
