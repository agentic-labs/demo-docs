## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for renaming and restructuring a database table related to notifications and events. The migration involves transforming a specific table from `file_upload_completed_notifications` to a more generic `events` table, modifying its schema to accommodate various types of events.

## What does it do?
The migration scripts in this directory perform the following actions:

1. Rename the `file_upload_completed_notifications` table to `events`, broadening its scope to handle different types of events beyond just file upload notifications.

2. Remove columns that were specific to file upload notifications (`user_read` and `group_uuid`).

3. Add new columns to support a more flexible event structure:
   - `event_type`: To categorize different types of events.
   - `event_data`: To store event-specific information in a JSON format.

4. Provide a way to revert these changes if needed, allowing the database to be rolled back to its previous state.

These changes enable the system to handle a wider variety of events in a more flexible manner, moving from a specific file upload notification system to a general-purpose event tracking system.

## Key Files

### up.sql
This file contains the SQL commands to apply the migration:

```sql
ALTER TABLE file_upload_completed_notifications RENAME TO events;
ALTER TABLE events DROP COLUMN user_read;
ALTER TABLE events DROP COLUMN group_uuid;
ALTER TABLE events ADD COLUMN event_type VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL;
ALTER TABLE events ADD COLUMN event_data JSONB NOT NULL;
```

It renames the table, removes specific columns, and adds new ones to support the new event structure.

### down.sql
This file contains the SQL commands to revert the migration:

```sql
ALTER TABLE events DROP COLUMN event_type;
ALTER TABLE events DROP COLUMN event_data;
ALTER TABLE events ADD COLUMN user_read BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false;
ALTER TABLE events ADD COLUMN collection_id UUID;
ALTER TABLE events RENAME TO file_upload_completed_notifications;
```

It undoes the changes made by `up.sql`, reverting the table name and structure to its original state.

## Configuration
The migration is identified by its timestamp: `2024-01-30-184712`. This timestamp is likely used by a database migration tool to track which migrations have been applied and in what order.

No additional configuration files or environment variables are specified for this migration.

## Dependencies
The migration scripts use standard SQL commands and do not appear to rely on any external libraries or frameworks. However, they do use PostgreSQL-specific features:

1. The `JSONB` data type is used for the `event_data` column, which is a PostgreSQL-specific binary JSON format.
2. The `UUID` data type is used in the `down.sql` script, which is supported natively by PostgreSQL.

These features suggest that the database system in use is PostgreSQL, likely version 9.4 or later, which introduced the `JSONB` data type.

The choice of PostgreSQL and its JSON capabilities allows for flexible storage of event data without needing to define a rigid structure for all possible event types in advance. This provides adaptability for future event types without requiring additional schema changes.
