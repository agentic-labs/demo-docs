## High-level description
This SQL script updates the `events` table in a database. It specifically targets records where the `event_type` column starts with "card_" and replaces that prefix with "chunk_". 

## Symbols

### `UPDATE events`
#### Description
This statement modifies existing records in the `events` table.

#### Internal Logic
1. **`SET event_type = REPLACE(event_type, 'card_', 'chunk_')`**: This part of the query updates the `event_type` column for each selected row. It uses the `REPLACE` function to substitute all occurrences of "card_" with "chunk_" within the `event_type` values.
2. **`WHERE event_type LIKE 'card_%'`**: This clause filters the rows to be updated. It selects only the rows where the `event_type` column starts with "card_" followed by any characters (indicated by the wildcard `%`).

## Side Effects
This script directly modifies data in the `events` table. All events previously categorized with types starting with "card_" will be recategorized with "chunk_" as the prefix.
