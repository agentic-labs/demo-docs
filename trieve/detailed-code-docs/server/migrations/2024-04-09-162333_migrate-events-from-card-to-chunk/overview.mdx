## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for updating event types in a database, specifically changing the prefix from 'card_' to 'chunk_' in the `events` table. The migration is reversible, with separate scripts for applying (up) and reverting (down) the changes.

## What does it do?
These scripts modify the database to reflect a change in terminology or structure within the application. They update all event types in the `events` table that start with 'card_' to instead start with 'chunk_'. This change likely corresponds to a shift in how the application conceptualizes or organizes its data, moving from a card-based model to a chunk-based model.

The migration can be applied to update the database to the new structure, and if needed, it can be reverted to restore the original state. This allows for flexible database management and version control of the database schema and data.

## Key Files

1. `up.sql`: This file contains the SQL script to apply the migration. It updates all event types in the `events` table, changing the prefix from 'card_' to 'chunk_'.

   ```sql
   UPDATE events
   SET event_type = REPLACE(event_type, 'card_', 'chunk_')
   WHERE event_type LIKE 'card_%';
   ```

2. `down.sql`: This file contains the SQL script to revert the migration. It changes all event types in the `events` table back from 'chunk_' to 'card_'.

   ```sql
   UPDATE events
   SET event_type = REPLACE(event_type, 'chunk_', 'card_')
   WHERE event_type LIKE 'chunk_%';
   ```

Both scripts use the SQL `UPDATE` statement with a `REPLACE` function to modify the `event_type` column in the `events` table. They also use a `WHERE` clause with the `LIKE` operator to target only the relevant rows.

## Side Effects
These migration scripts directly modify data in the `events` table of the database. When applied:

1. The `up.sql` script will change all event types that start with 'card_' to start with 'chunk_' instead.
2. The `down.sql` script will revert this change, updating all event types that start with 'chunk_' back to 'card_'.

It's important to note that these scripts will affect all matching rows in the `events` table. Depending on the size of the database and the number of affected rows, these operations could potentially be time-consuming and impact database performance during execution.

Also, any application code or queries that rely on the specific prefix ('card_' or 'chunk_') in the `event_type` column will need to be updated accordingly when this migration is applied or reverted.

## Configuration
The migration is identified by its timestamp: 2024-04-09-162333. This suggests that the migration system uses timestamps to order and track migrations. The timestamp indicates that this migration was created on April 9, 2024, at 16:23:33.

No additional configuration appears to be required for these scripts beyond the standard database connection settings that would be needed to execute SQL commands on the target database.
