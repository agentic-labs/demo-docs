## High-level description
This SQL migration script is designed to revert changes made in the corresponding `up.sql` file. It updates the `events` table by replacing the prefix 'chunk_' with 'card_' in the `event_type` column for all records where the `event_type` starts with 'chunk_'.

### SQL UPDATE Statement
#### Description
This SQL statement modifies existing records in the `events` table, specifically targeting the `event_type` column.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `UPDATE` statement targets the `events` table.
2. It uses the `SET` clause to modify the `event_type` column.
3. The `REPLACE` function is used to substitute 'chunk_' with 'card_' in the `event_type` value.
4. The `WHERE` clause filters the rows to be updated, selecting only those where `event_type` starts with 'chunk_'.

## Side Effects
This migration will modify existing data in the `events` table. Specifically:
- All `event_type` values that start with 'chunk_' will be changed to start with 'card_' instead.
- This change affects the categorization or classification of events in the system.

## Performance Considerations
Depending on the size of the `events` table and the number of records matching the `WHERE` condition, this update operation could potentially affect a large number of rows. For large datasets, it may be advisable to consider the timing of this migration to minimize impact on system performance during peak usage times.

## Error Handling
This SQL script does not include explicit error handling. It relies on the database system's default error handling mechanisms. If an error occurs during execution (e.g., table doesn't exist, insufficient permissions), the database will typically roll back the transaction and report the error.

## TODOs
The comment at the top of the file, "This file should undo anything in `up.sql`", suggests that this script is intended to reverse the changes made by a corresponding `up.sql` migration. It's important to ensure that this down migration accurately undoes all changes made in the up migration for proper version control of the database schema.
