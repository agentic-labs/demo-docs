## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for modifying indexes on the `chunk_metadata` table in a database. The migration adds a new JSON index and removes three existing indexes. The purpose of these changes is likely to optimize query performance for JSON data stored in the `metadata` column while removing potentially redundant or less efficient indexes.

## What does it do?
The migration scripts in this directory perform the following actions:

1. In the "up" direction (applying the migration):
   - It drops three existing indexes: `idx_card_metadata_link`, `idx_chunk_metadata_created_at`, and `idx_chunk_metadata_time_stamp`.
   - It creates a new GIN (Generalized Inverted Index) index named `idx_chunk_metadata_json` on the `metadata` column of the `chunk_metadata` table, using `jsonb_path_ops` for efficient JSON data indexing.

2. In the "down" direction (reverting the migration):
   - It drops the newly created `idx_chunk_metadata_json` index.
   - It recreates the three previously dropped indexes: `idx_card_metadata_link` (on the `link` column), `idx_chunk_metadata_created_at` (on the `created_at` column), and `idx_chunk_metadata_time_stamp` (on the `time_stamp` column).

These changes suggest that the database is transitioning from using separate indexes for specific columns to using a more versatile JSON index that can potentially cover multiple fields within the JSON data stored in the `metadata` column.

## Key Files

1. `up.sql`: This file contains the SQL commands to apply the migration. It drops the existing indexes and creates the new JSON index.

   ```sql
   DROP INDEX idx_card_metadata_link;
   DROP INDEX idx_chunk_metadata_created_at;
   DROP INDEX idx_chunk_metadata_time_stamp;
   CREATE INDEX idx_chunk_metadata_json ON chunk_metadata USING gin (metadata jsonb_path_ops);
   ```

2. `down.sql`: This file contains the SQL commands to revert the migration. It drops the new JSON index and recreates the original indexes.

   ```sql
   DROP INDEX idx_chunk_metadata_json;
   CREATE INDEX idx_card_metadata_link ON chunk_metadata (link);
   CREATE INDEX idx_chunk_metadata_created_at ON chunk_metadata (created_at);
   CREATE INDEX idx_chunk_metadata_time_stamp ON chunk_metadata (time_stamp);
   ```

These files work together to provide a reversible database migration, allowing the database schema to be updated or rolled back as needed.

## Configuration
The migration is identified by its timestamp: `2024-05-17-172734`. This timestamp is likely used by the migration system to track which migrations have been applied and in what order.

No additional configuration files or environment variables are specified for this migration.
