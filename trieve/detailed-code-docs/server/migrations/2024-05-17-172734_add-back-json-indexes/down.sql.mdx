## High-level description
This SQL script defines a database migration that reverts changes introduced by a previous migration, specifically the changes related to indexes on the `chunk_metadata` table. It drops an index named `idx_chunk_metadata_json` and creates three new indexes: `idx_card_metadata_link`, `idx_chunk_metadata_created_at`, and `idx_chunk_metadata_time_stamp`.

## Symbols
### `DROP INDEX idx_chunk_metadata_json;`
#### Description
This statement drops an existing index named `idx_chunk_metadata_json` from the `chunk_metadata` table. This index was likely created in the corresponding `up.sql` migration and is being reverted here.

### `CREATE INDEX idx_card_metadata_link ON chunk_metadata (link);`
#### Description
This statement creates a new index named `idx_card_metadata_link` on the `link` column of the `chunk_metadata` table. This index is likely intended to improve query performance when searching or filtering based on the `link` column.

### `CREATE INDEX idx_chunk_metadata_created_at ON chunk_metadata (created_at);`
#### Description
This statement creates a new index named `idx_chunk_metadata_created_at` on the `created_at` column of the `chunk_metadata` table. This index is likely intended to improve query performance when searching or filtering based on the `created_at` column, which likely stores the timestamp of when a record was created.

### `CREATE INDEX idx_chunk_metadata_time_stamp ON chunk_metadata (time_stamp);`
#### Description
This statement creates a new index named `idx_chunk_metadata_time_stamp` on the `time_stamp` column of the `chunk_metadata` table. This index is likely intended to improve query performance when searching or filtering based on the `time_stamp` column, which likely stores a timestamp related to the chunk metadata.
