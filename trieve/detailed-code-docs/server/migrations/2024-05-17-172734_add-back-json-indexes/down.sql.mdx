## High-level description
This SQL script defines the down migration for reverting changes related to JSON indexes on the `chunk_metadata` table. It's intended to be used with a database migration tool. The script specifically reverts the changes introduced in the corresponding `up.sql` migration file.

## Symbols
### `DROP INDEX idx_chunk_metadata_json`
#### Description
This statement drops the index named `idx_chunk_metadata_json` from the database. This index was likely created in the `up.sql` migration and is related to JSON data within the `chunk_metadata` table.

#### Side Effects
- Removes the `idx_chunk_metadata_json` index from the database.

### `CREATE INDEX idx_card_metadata_link ON chunk_metadata (link)`
#### Description
This statement creates an index named `idx_card_metadata_link` on the `link` column of the `chunk_metadata` table. This index is likely intended to improve query performance when searching or filtering by the `link` column.

#### Side Effects
- Creates the `idx_card_metadata_link` index in the database.

### `CREATE INDEX idx_chunk_metadata_created_at ON chunk_metadata (created_at)`
#### Description
This statement creates an index named `idx_chunk_metadata_created_at` on the `created_at` column of the `chunk_metadata` table. This index is likely intended to improve query performance when searching or filtering by the `created_at` column, which likely stores timestamps for when records were created.

#### Side Effects
- Creates the `idx_chunk_metadata_created_at` index in the database.

### `CREATE INDEX idx_chunk_metadata_time_stamp ON chunk_metadata (time_stamp)`
#### Description
This statement creates an index named `idx_chunk_metadata_time_stamp` on the `time_stamp` column of the `chunk_metadata` table. This index is likely intended to improve query performance when searching or filtering by the `time_stamp` column, which likely stores timestamps.

#### Side Effects
- Creates the `idx_chunk_metadata_time_stamp` index in the database.
