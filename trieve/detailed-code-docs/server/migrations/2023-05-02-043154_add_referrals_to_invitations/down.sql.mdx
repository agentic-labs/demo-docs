## High-level description
This SQL migration file is designed to revert the changes made in the corresponding `up.sql` file. It removes the `referral_tokens` column from the `invitations` table in the database.

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE invitations
#### Description
This SQL command modifies the structure of the `invitations` table by removing a specific column.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `ALTER TABLE` statement is used to modify the `invitations` table.
2. The `DROP COLUMN` clause is used to remove the `referral_tokens` column from the table.

## Side Effects
Executing this migration will permanently remove the `referral_tokens` column from the `invitations` table, along with any data stored in that column. This action is irreversible without restoring from a backup or re-running the corresponding `up` migration.

## Performance Considerations
Dropping a column is generally a fast operation, but it may lock the table briefly during execution. The impact on performance depends on the size of the table and the database system being used.

## TODOs
The comment at the top of the file suggests that this migration should undo anything done in the corresponding `up.sql` file. It's important to ensure that this `down.sql` file correctly reverses all changes made in the `up.sql` file to maintain database consistency when rolling back migrations.
