## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration files for adding a new `referral_tokens` column to the `invitations` table in the database. The migration is dated 2023-05-02 and is identified by the timestamp 043154. The directory includes both `up.sql` and `down.sql` files, which are used to apply and revert the migration, respectively.

## What does it do?
This migration modifies the database structure by adding a new capability to store referral token information within invitation records. Here's a simple explanation of what it does:

1. When applied (using the `up.sql` file), it adds a new column called `referral_tokens` to the `invitations` table. This column can store text data, allowing the system to associate referral tokens with specific invitations.

2. If the migration needs to be reversed (using the `down.sql` file), it removes the `referral_tokens` column from the `invitations` table, returning the table to its previous state.

This change enables the application to track and manage referral tokens as part of the invitation process, which could be used for features like referral programs or tracking the source of invitations.

## Key Files

1. `up.sql`:
   - This file contains the SQL command to add the `referral_tokens` column to the `invitations` table.
   - The command used is:
     ```sql
     ALTER TABLE invitations ADD COLUMN referral_tokens TEXT;
     ```
   - This adds a new TEXT column named `referral_tokens` to the `invitations` table.

2. `down.sql`:
   - This file contains the SQL command to remove the `referral_tokens` column from the `invitations` table.
   - The command used is:
     ```sql
     ALTER TABLE invitations DROP COLUMN referral_tokens;
     ```
   - This removes the `referral_tokens` column from the `invitations` table, effectively undoing the changes made by the `up.sql` file.

## Side Effects
Applying this migration will have the following side effects:

1. The `invitations` table structure will be modified, which may affect any queries or application code that interacts with this table.
2. Existing rows in the `invitations` table will have a `NULL` value for the new `referral_tokens` column unless a default value is specified (which is not the case in this migration).
3. When reverting the migration, any data stored in the `referral_tokens` column will be permanently lost.

## Performance Considerations
While adding or removing a column is generally a fast operation, there are some performance considerations to keep in mind:

1. For very large tables, the migration might take some time to complete and could potentially lock the table during the process.
2. The `TEXT` data type used for the `referral_tokens` column allows for storing strings of any length. Depending on the expected content and usage, a more specific data type might be more appropriate and could have performance implications.

## TODOs and Potential Improvements
While there are no explicit TODOs in the migration files, there are some potential improvements to consider:

1. Adding a default value or constraints for the `referral_tokens` column in a future migration, if required by the application logic.
2. Considering a more specific data type or adding constraints for the `referral_tokens` column, depending on the expected content and usage.
3. Ensuring that all application code and queries that interact with the `invitations` table are updated to accommodate the new column.
4. Documenting the purpose and expected format of the `referral_tokens` data for future developers.

In conclusion, this migration adds functionality to track referral tokens within the invitation system, potentially enabling new features or improving existing ones related to user referrals and invitation tracking.
