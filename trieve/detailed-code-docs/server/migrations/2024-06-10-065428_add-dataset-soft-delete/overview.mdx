## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for adding soft delete functionality to the datasets table in the database. The migration is identified by the timestamp 2024-06-10-065428 and is named "add-dataset-soft-delete". It consists of two files: `up.sql` for applying the changes and `down.sql` for reverting them.

## What does it do?
The migration adds a new column called `deleted` to the `datasets` table. This column is used to implement soft delete functionality, which means that instead of permanently removing records from the database, they are marked as deleted by setting a value in this column. This approach allows for easier data recovery and maintains referential integrity.

The migration also creates an index on the `deleted` column to improve query performance when filtering for deleted or non-deleted datasets.

When the migration is rolled back, it removes the `deleted` column and its associated index, effectively undoing the soft delete implementation.

## Key Files

1. `up.sql`: This file contains the SQL statements to apply the migration.
   - It adds the `deleted` column to the `datasets` table as an integer with a default value of 0 and a NOT NULL constraint.
   - It creates an index named `idx_dataset_deleted` on the `deleted` column.

2. `down.sql`: This file contains the SQL statements to revert the migration.
   - It drops the `deleted` column from the `datasets` table.
   - It drops the `idx_dataset_deleted` index.

## Configuration
The migration uses SQL statements that are likely compatible with PostgreSQL, given the syntax and the use of the `IF EXISTS` and `IF NOT EXISTS` clauses. The specific database configuration is not provided in these files but would be necessary for executing the migration.

Here's a breakdown of the configurable fields in the migration:

1. Table name: `datasets`
2. New column name: `deleted`
3. Column type: `INT`
4. Default value: `0`
5. Index name: `idx_dataset_deleted`

These values could potentially be parameterized in a more sophisticated migration system, allowing for easier customization across different environments or projects.

## Side Effects
Applying this migration will have the following effects on the database:

1. The `datasets` table will have a new column `deleted`, which will be used to mark records as deleted without physically removing them from the database.
2. Queries on the `datasets` table may need to be updated to include a condition on the `deleted` column to filter out soft-deleted records.
3. The new index `idx_dataset_deleted` will improve performance for queries that filter on the `deleted` column.
4. Existing applications or scripts that interact with the `datasets` table will need to be updated to handle the new `deleted` column appropriately.

When reverting the migration:

1. The `deleted` column and its associated index will be removed from the `datasets` table.
2. Any data stored in the `deleted` column will be permanently lost.
3. Applications or scripts that were updated to use the `deleted` column will need to be reverted to their previous state.

It's important to note that this migration only adds the structure for soft deletes. The actual implementation of soft delete logic in the application code is not included in these SQL scripts and would need to be handled separately in the application layer.
