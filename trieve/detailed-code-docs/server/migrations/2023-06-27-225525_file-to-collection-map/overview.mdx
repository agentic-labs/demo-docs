## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for creating and dropping a table named `collections_from_files`. The migration is identified by the timestamp 2023-06-27-225525 and is related to mapping files to collections. The directory includes two SQL files: `up.sql` for creating the table and `down.sql` for dropping it.

## What does it do?
These migration scripts manage the creation and deletion of a database table that establishes a many-to-many relationship between card collections and files. The `up.sql` script creates a new table called `collections_from_files`, which allows tracking which files belong to which card collections. This table acts as a bridge between the `card_collection` and `files` tables, enabling a more flexible association between collections and their related files.

The `down.sql` script provides a way to revert the changes made by `up.sql` by dropping the `collections_from_files` table. This is useful for rolling back the database to its previous state if needed.

## Key Files

1. `up.sql`:
   This file contains the SQL script to create the `collections_from_files` table. It defines the table structure with the following columns:
   - `id`: A UUID primary key
   - `collection_id`: A UUID foreign key referencing the `card_collection` table
   - `file_id`: A UUID foreign key referencing the `files` table
   - `created_at`: A timestamp for record creation
   - `updated_at`: A timestamp for record updates

   The script also sets up foreign key constraints with cascading deletes, ensuring referential integrity between the `collections_from_files` table and the `card_collection` and `files` tables.

2. `down.sql`:
   This file contains a simple SQL command to drop the `collections_from_files` table, effectively undoing the changes made by the `up.sql` script.

## Configuration
The migration scripts don't require any external configuration. They are designed to be run as part of a database migration process, typically managed by an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool or a custom migration system.

The naming convention of the directory (2023-06-27-225525_file-to-collection-map) suggests that these migrations are part of a versioned migration system, where the timestamp (2023-06-27-225525) indicates when the migration was created, and the suffix (file-to-collection-map) describes the purpose of the migration.

When executing these migrations, it's important to ensure that:
1. The database user has sufficient privileges to create and drop tables.
2. The referenced tables (`card_collection` and `files`) exist in the database before running the `up.sql` script.
3. There are no existing foreign key constraints or dependencies on the `collections_from_files` table when running the `down.sql` script.

These migration scripts provide a structured way to evolve the database schema, allowing for the addition of a new relationship between files and collections, and the ability to revert this change if necessary.
