## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for creating and dropping a table named `collections_from_files` in the database. The migration is dated 2023-06-27 and is designed to establish a many-to-many relationship between card collections and files.

## What does it do?
The migration scripts in this directory create a new table that links card collections to files. This allows the system to track which files belong to which card collections. The table stores unique identifiers for each relationship, along with references to the specific collection and file involved. It also keeps track of when each relationship was created and last updated.

If needed, the migration can be reversed, which would remove this table and all the relationships it stores.

## Key Files

### up.sql
This file contains the SQL commands to create the `collections_from_files` table. It defines the structure of the table, including:

- A unique identifier for each relationship
- References to the related card collection and file
- Timestamps for creation and last update
- Cascade delete constraints to maintain referential integrity

Here's a simplified version of the table structure:

```sql
CREATE TABLE collections_from_files (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    collection_id UUID REFERENCES card_collection(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    file_id UUID REFERENCES files(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### down.sql
This file contains the SQL command to drop the `collections_from_files` table, effectively reversing the migration:

```sql
DROP TABLE collections_from_files;
```

## Configuration
The migration is identified by its timestamp: 2023-06-27-225525. This timestamp is used to order migrations and ensure they are applied in the correct sequence.

## Dependencies
This migration depends on the existence of two other tables in the database:

1. `card_collection`: Referenced by the `collection_id` foreign key
2. `files`: Referenced by the `file_id` foreign key

The migration assumes these tables already exist in the database schema.

By creating this many-to-many relationship table, the system gains the ability to associate multiple files with multiple card collections, providing flexibility in organizing and managing card-related files within the application.
