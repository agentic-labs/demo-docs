## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for managing database schema changes related to datasets, tags, and metadata in a server application. The migrations cover a wide range of operations including table creation, column additions/removals, index management, and trigger implementations.

## What does it do?
The migration scripts in this directory perform various database schema modifications and optimizations:

1. Create and manage tables for datasets, tags, metadata, and related entities.
2. Add, modify, and remove columns to adapt to changing data requirements.
3. Implement and update triggers for maintaining data integrity and counts.
4. Create and drop indexes to optimize query performance.
5. Handle soft delete functionality for datasets and organizations.
6. Manage API key scopes and permissions.
7. Integrate with Stripe for invoice and subscription handling.

These migrations allow the application to evolve its data model over time, improving performance, adding new features, and maintaining data consistency.

## Entry points
The main entry points for these migrations are the `up.sql` and `down.sql` files in each timestamped directory. The `up.sql` files apply changes to the database schema, while the `down.sql` files revert those changes.

Key tables and entities affected by these migrations include:
- datasets
- tags (dataset_tags, chunk_metadata_tags)
- chunk_metadata
- organizations
- user_api_key
- stripe_invoices and stripe_subscriptions

The migrations are designed to be applied sequentially based on their timestamps, with each migration building upon or modifying the changes made by previous ones.

## Key Files
While all migration files are important, some notable ones include:

1. `2024-06-06-031312_create-tag-set-table/up.sql`: Creates tables for dataset tags and chunk metadata tags.
2. `2024-07-11-222705_use-builtin-updated-created-at/up.sql`: Implements a more efficient timestamp management system.
3. `2024-07-15-221313_scoped_api_keys/up.sql`: Adds support for scoped API keys.
4. `2024-08-02-173037_add-index-on-created_at/up.sql`: Adds indexes to improve query performance on creation dates.

## Dependencies
These migrations primarily depend on:

1. PostgreSQL: Many migrations use PostgreSQL-specific features like JSONB data types and PL/pgSQL for stored procedures.
2. A database migration tool (likely Diesel, based on function names) to manage the execution of these scripts.
3. Existing table structures and relationships within the database.

## Configuration
The migrations themselves don't require external configuration. However, the migration system likely uses the timestamp in each directory name (e.g., `2024-08-13-181329`) to determine the order of execution.

When applying these migrations, database administrators should ensure:
1. Proper backups are in place before running migrations.
2. The database user has sufficient permissions to create/alter tables, indexes, and triggers.
3. The application code is updated to work with the new schema after migrations are applied.

These migrations represent a comprehensive evolution of the database schema, supporting features like tagging, metadata management, API key scoping, and integration with external services like Stripe. They demonstrate a careful approach to database management, with consideration for performance optimization and data integrity.
