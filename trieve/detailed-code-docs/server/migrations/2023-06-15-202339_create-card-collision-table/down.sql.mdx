## High-level description
This SQL script defines the "down" migration for reverting changes introduced by the "up" migration related to the `card_collisions` table and a unique constraint on the `card_metadata` table. It's intended to be executed as part of a database migration rollback.

## Symbols

### `DROP TABLE card_collisions`
#### Description
This statement drops the `card_collisions` table from the database. This action is typically irreversible, and all data within the table will be lost.

#### Side Effects
- The `card_collisions` table is permanently deleted from the database.

### `ALTER TABLE card_metadata DROP CONSTRAINT uq_qdrant_point_id`
#### Description
This statement removes the unique constraint named `uq_qdrant_point_id` from the `card_metadata` table. This likely means that the column or set of columns that were previously restricted to having unique values will no longer have that restriction after this statement is executed.

#### Side Effects
- The `card_metadata` table will no longer enforce uniqueness on the column(s) associated with the `uq_qdrant_point_id` constraint.
