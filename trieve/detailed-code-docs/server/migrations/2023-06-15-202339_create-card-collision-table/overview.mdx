## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for creating and managing a `card_collisions` table and modifying the `card_metadata` table in a database. The migration is dated 2023-06-15 and is specifically focused on introducing a new table to handle card collisions and enforcing uniqueness on the `qdrant_point_id` column in the existing `card_metadata` table.

## What does it do?
These migration scripts perform the following actions:

1. In the "up" migration:
   - Add a unique constraint to the `qdrant_point_id` column in the `card_metadata` table.
   - Create a new `card_collisions` table to store information about collisions between cards.
   - Create an index on the `card_id` column of the `card_collisions` table for improved query performance.

2. In the "down" migration:
   - Drop the `card_collisions` table, removing all stored collision data.
   - Remove the unique constraint on the `qdrant_point_id` column in the `card_metadata` table.

These actions allow the database to track and manage collisions between cards, likely based on some similarity metric related to the `qdrant_point_id`. The unique constraint on `qdrant_point_id` ensures that each card has a unique identifier in the Qdrant vector database system.

## Key Files

1. `up.sql`: This file contains the SQL statements to create the new `card_collisions` table, add the unique constraint to the `card_metadata` table, and create the index on the `card_collisions` table.

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE card_metadata ADD CONSTRAINT uq_qdrant_point_id UNIQUE (qdrant_point_id);

   CREATE TABLE card_collisions (
       id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
       card_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES card_metadata (id),
       collision_qdrant_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES card_metadata (qdrant_point_id)
   );

   CREATE INDEX idx_card_collisions_card_id ON card_collisions (card_id);
   ```

2. `down.sql`: This file contains the SQL statements to revert the changes made by the `up.sql` script.

   ```sql
   DROP TABLE card_collisions;
   ALTER TABLE card_metadata DROP CONSTRAINT uq_qdrant_point_id;
   ```

These files work together to provide a reversible database migration, allowing for easy application and rollback of the changes to the database schema.

## Dependencies
This migration relies on the existing `card_metadata` table in the database. It assumes that this table already exists and has columns `id` and `qdrant_point_id`.

The migration uses UUID data types, indicating that the database system must support UUID operations. This is commonly available in modern database systems like PostgreSQL.

## Configuration
The migration scripts do not directly reference any configuration files or environment variables. However, the database connection details and migration framework configuration would typically be managed externally to these SQL scripts.

When applying these migrations, database administrators or application developers should ensure:

1. The target database is correctly configured and accessible.
2. The `card_metadata` table exists and has the expected structure.
3. The database user executing the migration has sufficient privileges to create tables, alter existing tables, and create indexes.
4. Any existing data in the `card_metadata` table complies with the new unique constraint on `qdrant_point_id`. If duplicate values exist, they should be resolved before applying the "up" migration.

It's important to note that the "down" migration will result in data loss from the `card_collisions` table. This should be considered carefully before rolling back this migration in a production environment.
