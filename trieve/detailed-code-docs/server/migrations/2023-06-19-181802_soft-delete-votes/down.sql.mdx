title: "down.sql"
---

## High-level description
This SQL script reverts the changes introduced by the migration `2023-06-19-181802_soft-delete-votes`, specifically the addition of the `deleted` column to the `card_votes` table. This suggests the migration implemented soft delete functionality for card votes, and this "down" script removes that functionality.

## Symbols

### `ALTER TABLE card_votes DROP COLUMN deleted;`
#### Description
This SQL statement removes the `deleted` column from the `card_votes` table. This reverts the table structure to its state before the `up.sql` migration was applied.

#### Internal Logic
- **`ALTER TABLE card_votes`**: This clause specifies that the `card_votes` table is being modified.
- **`DROP COLUMN deleted`**: This clause instructs the database to remove the column named `deleted` from the table.

#### Side Effects
- **Data Loss**: Removing the `deleted` column permanently deletes any data stored in that column. This means any information about previously "soft-deleted" card votes will be lost.
