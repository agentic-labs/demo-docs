title: "down.sql"

## High-level description
This SQL script reverts a database migration that added a "soft delete" feature to the `card_votes` table. It removes the `deleted` column from the table.

## Symbols

### `ALTER TABLE card_votes DROP COLUMN deleted;`
#### Description
This SQL statement removes the `deleted` column from the `card_votes` table. This effectively undoes the addition of the soft delete functionality implemented in the corresponding `up.sql` migration script.

#### Internal Logic
- **`ALTER TABLE card_votes`**: This clause specifies that the `card_votes` table is being modified.
- **`DROP COLUMN deleted`**: This clause instructs the database to remove the column named `deleted` from the table.

#### Side Effects
- The `deleted` column is permanently removed from the `card_votes` table.
- Any data previously stored in the `deleted` column is lost.
