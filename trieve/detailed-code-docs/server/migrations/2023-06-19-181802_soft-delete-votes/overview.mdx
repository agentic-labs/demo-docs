## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for implementing a "soft delete" feature for votes in the card_votes table of the database. The migration adds a new boolean column named "deleted" to the card_votes table, allowing votes to be marked as deleted without actually removing them from the database.

## What does it do?
The migration scripts in this directory modify the structure of the card_votes table in the database. They add a new column called "deleted" which is used to indicate whether a vote has been soft-deleted or not. 

Soft deletion is a technique where, instead of permanently removing data from a database, you mark it as deleted by setting a flag (in this case, the "deleted" column). This allows for easier data recovery and maintains a historical record of all votes, even those that have been "deleted".

When the migration is applied:
1. A new boolean column named "deleted" is added to the card_votes table.
2. This column is set to not allow null values, ensuring every vote has a deletion status.
3. The default value for this column is set to false, meaning new votes are not considered deleted by default.

If the migration needs to be reversed, the "deleted" column is simply dropped from the card_votes table, removing the soft delete functionality.

## Key Files

### up.sql
This file contains the SQL commands to apply the migration. It adds the "deleted" column to the card_votes table.

```sql
ALTER TABLE card_votes ADD COLUMN deleted boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT false;
```

This command does the following:
- Alters the card_votes table
- Adds a new column named "deleted"
- Sets the column type to boolean
- Makes the column NOT NULL (it must always have a value)
- Sets the default value to false (votes are not deleted by default)

### down.sql
This file contains the SQL commands to reverse the migration. It removes the "deleted" column from the card_votes table.

```sql
ALTER TABLE card_votes DROP COLUMN deleted;
```

This command simply drops the "deleted" column, effectively removing the soft delete functionality.

## Configuration
This migration doesn't require any specific configuration. It's designed to be run as part of a database migration process, likely managed by an ORM or migration tool in the main application.

The migration is timestamped (2023-06-19-181802), which suggests it uses a timestamp-based naming convention for ordering migrations. This is common in many database migration systems to ensure migrations are applied in the correct order.

In conclusion, this migration implements a soft delete feature for votes, allowing the application to mark votes as deleted without permanently removing them from the database. This can be useful for data integrity, auditing, and potentially allowing for "undelete" functionality in the future.
