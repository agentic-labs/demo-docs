## High-level description
This SQL script defines the **down** migration that reverts the changes introduced by the `up.sql` migration related to setting default organization usage data. It specifically drops a trigger, a function, and a unique constraint related to organizations.

## Code Structure
The script executes three SQL statements in sequence:
1. Drops a trigger named `set_default_org_usage_data_trigger` on the `organizations` table.
2. Drops a function named `set_default_org_usage_data`.
3. Adds a unique constraint named `organizations_name_key` on the `name` column of the `organizations` table.

## Symbols

### `DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS set_default_org_usage_data_trigger ON organizations`
#### Description
This statement drops the trigger named `set_default_org_usage_data_trigger` associated with the `organizations` table if it exists. This prevents the trigger from executing any further.

#### Internal Logic
- It uses `DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS` to conditionally drop the trigger only if it already exists, preventing errors if the trigger was not created in the first place.
- `set_default_org_usage_data_trigger` is the name of the trigger being dropped.
- `ON organizations` specifies that the trigger is associated with the `organizations` table.

### `DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS set_default_org_usage_data`
#### Description
This statement drops the function named `set_default_org_usage_data` if it exists.

#### Internal Logic
- It uses `DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS` to conditionally drop the function only if it already exists.
- `set_default_org_usage_data` is the name of the function being dropped.

### `ALTER TABLE organizations ADD CONSTRAINT organizations_name_key UNIQUE (name)`
#### Description
This statement adds a unique constraint named `organizations_name_key` to the `name` column of the `organizations` table. This ensures that all organization names are unique.

#### Internal Logic
- `ALTER TABLE organizations` specifies that the following changes are being applied to the `organizations` table.
- `ADD CONSTRAINT organizations_name_key UNIQUE (name)` adds a new constraint named `organizations_name_key` that enforces uniqueness on the `name` column.
