## High-level description
This SQL script defines a PostgreSQL function and trigger to automatically create a corresponding record in the `organization_usage_counts` table whenever a new organization is added to the `organizations` table. It also drops a unique constraint on the `name` column of the `organizations` table.

## Symbols

### `set_default_org_usage_data()`
#### Description
This function inserts a new row into the `organization_usage_counts` table with the `org_id` set to the `id` of the newly created organization. If a row with the same `org_id` already exists, the function does nothing.

#### Inputs
This function does not take any explicit inputs. It implicitly relies on the `NEW` record available in the trigger context.

#### Outputs
This function returns `NEW` which represents the newly inserted row in the `organizations` table.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Insert Statement:** Attempts to insert a new row into the `organization_usage_counts` table.
   - The `org_id` for the new row is set to the `id` of the newly inserted organization (accessible via `NEW.id`).
2. **Conflict Handling:** Uses `ON CONFLICT (org_id) DO NOTHING` to handle cases where a row with the same `org_id` already exists. In such cases, the insert is skipped.
3. **Return Value:** Returns `NEW`, representing the newly inserted organization record.

### `set_default_org_usage_data_trigger`
#### Description
This trigger automatically executes the `set_default_org_usage_data()` function after a new row is inserted into the `organizations` table.

#### Internal Logic
- **Trigger Type:** `AFTER INSERT` specifies that the trigger should fire after a new row is inserted.
- **Triggering Event:** `ON organizations` indicates that the trigger is associated with the `organizations` table.
- **Trigger Level:** `FOR EACH ROW` ensures that the trigger fires for each inserted row individually.
- **Action:** `EXECUTE FUNCTION set_default_org_usage_data()` calls the defined function to create the corresponding usage data record.

### `ALTER TABLE organizations DROP CONSTRAINT organizations_name_key`
#### Description
This statement drops the unique constraint named `organizations_name_key` from the `organizations` table. This implies that the `name` column no longer needs to be unique in the `organizations` table.
