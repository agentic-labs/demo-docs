## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for setting default organization usage data in a database. It consists of two files: `up.sql` for applying the changes and `down.sql` for reverting them. The migration primarily deals with the `organizations` and `organization_usage_counts` tables, introducing a mechanism to automatically create usage data records for new organizations.

## What does it do?
The migration accomplishes the following:

1. Removes the unique constraint on the `name` column of the `organizations` table, allowing for potentially duplicate organization names.
2. Creates a function `set_default_org_usage_data()` that automatically inserts a new row into the `organization_usage_counts` table whenever a new organization is added.
3. Sets up a trigger `set_default_org_usage_data_trigger` on the `organizations` table to execute the above function after each new organization insertion.

These changes ensure that every new organization automatically gets an associated usage count record, simplifying data management and maintaining consistency between the `organizations` and `organization_usage_counts` tables.

## Key Files

### up.sql
This file contains the SQL statements to apply the migration:

1. Drops the unique constraint on the `name` column of the `organizations` table:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE organizations DROP CONSTRAINT organizations_name_key;
   ```

2. Creates the `set_default_org_usage_data()` function:
   ```sql
   CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION set_default_org_usage_data()
   RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
   BEGIN
     INSERT INTO organization_usage_counts (org_id)
     VALUES (NEW.id)
     ON CONFLICT (org_id) DO NOTHING;
     RETURN NEW;
   END;
   $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
   ```

3. Sets up the trigger to execute the function:
   ```sql
   CREATE TRIGGER set_default_org_usage_data_trigger
   AFTER INSERT ON organizations
   FOR EACH ROW
   EXECUTE FUNCTION set_default_org_usage_data();
   ```

### down.sql
This file contains the SQL statements to revert the migration:

1. Drops the trigger:
   ```sql
   DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS set_default_org_usage_data_trigger ON organizations;
   ```

2. Drops the function:
   ```sql
   DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS set_default_org_usage_data;
   ```

3. Adds back the unique constraint on the `name` column:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE organizations ADD CONSTRAINT organizations_name_key UNIQUE (name);
   ```

## Configuration
This migration doesn't rely on any external configuration files or environment variables. The changes are applied directly to the database schema and are managed through the migration system (likely using a tool like Diesel or similar ORM for Rust).

## Dependencies
The migration scripts are written in SQL and are designed to work with PostgreSQL. They don't directly depend on external libraries, but they assume the existence of certain tables (`organizations` and `organization_usage_counts`) in the database schema.

## Additional Notes

1. **Data Integrity**: The removal of the unique constraint on the `organizations.name` column allows for potential duplicate organization names. This change should be carefully considered in terms of its impact on data integrity and application logic.

2. **Error Handling**: The `set_default_org_usage_data()` function uses `ON CONFLICT (org_id) DO NOTHING` to handle cases where a usage count record already exists for an organization. This ensures that the function doesn't fail if a record is unexpectedly present, but it also means that existing records won't be updated.

3. **Performance**: The trigger will execute for each new organization insertion. While this is generally efficient for maintaining data consistency, it could potentially impact performance if large numbers of organizations are being inserted simultaneously.

4. **Reversibility**: The migration is fully reversible, with the `down.sql` script restoring the database to its previous state. However, any data changes made while the migration was active (such as duplicate organization names) would need to be handled separately if reverting the migration.

5. **Compatibility**: Ensure that any application code interacting with the `organizations` table is updated to handle potentially non-unique names if this was previously relied upon.

This migration represents a significant change in how organization data is managed, introducing automatic creation of usage data and removing the uniqueness requirement for organization names. It's important to thoroughly test these changes and update any dependent application code accordingly.
