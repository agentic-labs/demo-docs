## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for modifying the structure of the `topics` table in a database. The migration specifically removes the `side` and `normal_chat` columns from the table. The directory includes two SQL files: `up.sql` for applying the changes and `down.sql` for reverting them.

## What does it do?
The migration scripts in this directory perform the following actions:

1. The `up.sql` script removes two columns from the `topics` table:
   - It drops the `side` column, which was likely used to store some kind of categorization or orientation information for topics.
   - It also drops the `normal_chat` column, which was probably a boolean flag indicating whether a topic was for normal chat or some special purpose.

2. The `down.sql` script provides a way to revert these changes:
   - It adds back the `side` column as a VARCHAR(255), allowing for string values up to 255 characters.
   - It also adds back the `normal_chat` column as a BOOLEAN with a default value of TRUE.

These scripts allow database administrators or developers to easily apply or roll back changes to the database structure, ensuring that the application's data model can be updated or reverted as needed.

## Key Files

1. `up.sql`:
   This file contains the SQL commands to apply the migration. It removes the `side` and `normal_chat` columns from the `topics` table. Here's the content of the file:

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE topics DROP COLUMN side;
   ALTER TABLE topics DROP COLUMN normal_chat;
   ```

2. `down.sql`:
   This file contains the SQL commands to revert the migration. It adds back the `side` and `normal_chat` columns to the `topics` table. Here's the content of the file:

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE topics ADD COLUMN side VARCHAR(255);
   ALTER TABLE topics ADD COLUMN normal_chat BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE;
   ```

These files work together to provide a reversible change to the database schema. The `up.sql` script is used when applying the migration, while the `down.sql` script is used when rolling back the changes.

## Configuration
The migration is identified by its timestamp-based directory name: `2024-01-24-021641_remove_side_from_topic`. This naming convention is likely used by a migration tool to determine the order in which migrations should be applied or rolled back.

No additional configuration files or environment variables are present in this directory. The migration relies solely on the SQL scripts to define the changes to be made to the database.
