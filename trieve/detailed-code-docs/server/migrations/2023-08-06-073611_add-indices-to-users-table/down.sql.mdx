## High-level description
This SQL script is designed to undo the creation of indices on the `users` table. It removes various indices that were previously added to improve query performance on specific columns of the `users` table.

### DROP INDEX statements
#### Description
Each `DROP INDEX` statement in this script is responsible for removing a specific index from the `users` table. The script uses the `IF EXISTS` clause to ensure that the operation doesn't fail if the index doesn't exist.

#### Internal Logic
The script follows a consistent pattern for each index removal:
1. It uses the `DROP INDEX` SQL command.
2. It includes the `IF EXISTS` clause to make the operation idempotent.
3. It targets a specific index name, which follows the naming convention `idx_users_&lt;column_name&gt;`.

Here's a breakdown of the indices being removed:

1. `idx_users_id`: Index on the `id` column
2. `idx_users_email`: Index on the `email` column
3. `idx_users_hash`: Index on the `hash` column
4. `idx_users_username`: Index on the `username` column
5. `idx_users_website`: Index on the `website` column
6. `idx_users_created_at`: Index on the `created_at` column
7. `idx_users_updated_at`: Index on the `updated_at` column

## Side Effects
The execution of this script will remove the specified indices from the `users` table. This may impact query performance, particularly for queries that were previously optimized to use these indices. However, it will not affect the data stored in the table itself.

## Performance Considerations
Removing indices can have both positive and negative performance implications:
- It may slow down queries that were previously using these indices for faster data retrieval.
- It can potentially speed up insert, update, and delete operations, as the database no longer needs to maintain these indices.
- It will reduce the overall storage space required for the table, as indices consume additional disk space.

## Error Handling
The script uses `IF EXISTS` clauses to prevent errors if an index doesn't exist. This makes the script more robust and allows it to be run multiple times without failing.

## TODOs
The script includes a comment at the top: "This file should undo anything in `up.sql`". This suggests that there is a corresponding `up.sql` file that created these indices, and this `down.sql` script is designed to revert those changes.
