### `up.sql`
#### Description
This SQL script creates indices on the `users` table for the following columns: `id`, `email`, `hash`, `username`, `website`, `created_at`, and `updated_at`.

#### Internal Logic
The script uses the `CREATE INDEX` statement to create each index. The syntax for creating an index is as follows:

```sql
CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name (column_name);
```

* `index_name`: The name of the index being created.
* `table_name`: The name of the table to which the index belongs.
* `column_name`: The name of the column on which the index is being created.

#### Side Effects
- **Improved query performance:**  Indices speed up data retrieval by creating a sorted data structure that allows the database to quickly locate specific rows.
- **Increased storage space:** Indices require additional storage space, which can increase the overall size of the database.

#### Performance Considerations
Creating indices can significantly improve the performance of queries that filter or sort by the indexed columns. However, it's important to note that indices also come with a cost:

- **Increased write time:**  Adding, updating, or deleting rows in the table becomes slightly slower because the index also needs to be updated.
- **Increased storage space:** Indices require additional storage space, which can increase the overall size of the database.

Therefore, it's important to carefully consider which columns to index based on the specific needs of the application.
