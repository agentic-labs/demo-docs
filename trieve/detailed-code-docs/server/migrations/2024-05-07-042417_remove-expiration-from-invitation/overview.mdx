## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for modifying the `invitations` table in a database. The migration removes the `expires_at` column from the table, indicating a change in how invitation expiration is handled in the application.

## What does it do?
The migration scripts in this directory perform the following actions:

1. The "up" migration removes the `expires_at` column from the `invitations` table. This suggests that the application no longer needs to store an expiration timestamp for invitations directly in the database.

2. The "down" migration adds the `expires_at` column back to the `invitations` table. This allows for reverting the changes made by the "up" migration if needed.

These changes imply that the application is moving away from using a database-stored expiration time for invitations. This could mean that invitation expiration is now handled differently, perhaps through application logic or a different mechanism.

## Key Files

### up.sql
This file contains the SQL command to remove the `expires_at` column from the `invitations` table:

```sql
ALTER TABLE invitations DROP COLUMN expires_at;
```

When this migration is applied, it will permanently delete the `expires_at` column and all its data from the `invitations` table.

### down.sql
This file contains the SQL command to add the `expires_at` column back to the `invitations` table:

```sql
ALTER TABLE invitations ADD COLUMN expires_at timestamp;
```

This migration is used to revert the changes made by the "up" migration. It adds a `timestamp` column named `expires_at` to the `invitations` table.

## Configuration
The migration is identified by its timestamp: 2024-05-07-042417. This timestamp is likely used by the migration system to track which migrations have been applied and in what order.

The naming convention of the directory (YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS_description) provides information about when the migration was created and what it does. In this case, it was created on May 7, 2024, at 04:24:17, and its purpose is to remove the expiration from the invitation.

## Dependencies
This migration relies on the existence of a database system that supports SQL, particularly the ALTER TABLE command. The specific database system is not mentioned, but it's likely to be a relational database management system (RDBMS) such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQLite.

The migration also depends on the existence of an `invitations` table in the database schema prior to this migration being applied.

In conclusion, this migration represents a significant change in how the application handles invitation expiration. By removing the `expires_at` column, the application is likely moving towards a different method of managing invitation lifetimes, possibly implementing this logic at the application level rather than relying on a database-stored timestamp.
