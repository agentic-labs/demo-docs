## High-level description
This SQL migration script removes the `expires_at` column from the `invitations` table in the database. It's part of a database schema change to eliminate the expiration functionality from invitations.

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE invitations DROP COLUMN expires_at;
#### Description
This SQL statement modifies the structure of the `invitations` table by removing the `expires_at` column.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `ALTER TABLE` command is used to modify the structure of an existing table.
2. `invitations` is the name of the table being altered.
3. `DROP COLUMN` is the specific alteration being made, which removes a column from the table.
4. `expires_at` is the name of the column being removed from the `invitations` table.

## Side Effects
- This migration will permanently remove the `expires_at` column and all its data from the `invitations` table.
- Any existing queries, applications, or processes that rely on the `expires_at` column will need to be updated to reflect this change.
- The storage space used by the `expires_at` column will be reclaimed.

## Performance Considerations
- This operation may lock the `invitations` table for the duration of the column removal, which could impact database performance temporarily, especially if the table is large.
- After the migration, queries on the `invitations` table may perform slightly faster due to the reduced data size, although the impact is likely minimal unless the table is very large.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| PostgreSQL | This SQL syntax is compatible with PostgreSQL, which is likely the database system being used. |

## TODOs
It's important to note that this is an "up" migration script. There should be a corresponding "down" migration script that would add the `expires_at` column back to the `invitations` table if the migration needs to be reversed.
