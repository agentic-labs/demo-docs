## High-level description
This SQL migration file is designed to revert changes made in the corresponding `up.sql` file. It adds back the `expires_at` column to the `invitations` table, which was presumably removed in the `up.sql` migration.

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE invitations ADD COLUMN expires_at timestamp;
#### Description
This SQL statement adds a new column named `expires_at` to the `invitations` table. The column is of type `timestamp`, which is used to store date and time information.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `ALTER TABLE` command is used to modify the structure of an existing table.
2. `invitations` is the name of the table being altered.
3. `ADD COLUMN` specifies that a new column is being added to the table.
4. `expires_at` is the name of the new column being added.
5. `timestamp` is the data type of the new column, which can store both date and time information.

## Side Effects
- This migration will modify the structure of the `invitations` table in the database.
- Any existing rows in the `invitations` table will have a new `expires_at` column added, but the values will be NULL unless explicitly set.
- Applications or queries that rely on the structure of the `invitations` table may need to be updated to account for the new column.

## Performance Considerations
Adding a new column to an existing table can be a relatively quick operation in most database systems, especially if the table is not very large. However, for very large tables, this operation might take some time and could potentially lock the table during the process, depending on the database system being used.

## TODOs
The comment at the top of the file suggests that this migration should undo anything done in the corresponding `up.sql` file. It's important to ensure that this down migration exactly reverses the changes made in the up migration to maintain consistency in the database schema when rolling back changes.
