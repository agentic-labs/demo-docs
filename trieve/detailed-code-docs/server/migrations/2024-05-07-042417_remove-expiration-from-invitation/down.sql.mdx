title: "down.sql"
---

## High-level description
This SQL script reverts a database migration by adding back the `expires_at` column to the `invitations` table. This suggests that the `up.sql` migration removed this column, and this "down" migration undoes that change.

## Symbols

### `ALTER TABLE invitations ADD COLUMN expires_at timestamp;`
#### Description
This SQL statement adds a column named `expires_at` to the `invitations` table. The column's data type is `timestamp`, which will store a date and time value.

#### Internal Logic
- **`ALTER TABLE invitations`**: This part specifies that the `invitations` table is being modified.
- **`ADD COLUMN expires_at`**: This adds a new column named `expires_at` to the table.
- **`timestamp`**: This defines the data type of the new column as `timestamp`.

#### Side Effects
This statement modifies the database schema by adding a column to the `invitations` table.
