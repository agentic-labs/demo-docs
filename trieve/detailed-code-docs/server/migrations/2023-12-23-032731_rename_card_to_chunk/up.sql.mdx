## High-level description
This SQL migration script renames various database tables and columns, changing references from "card" to "chunk". The script is designed to update the database schema, reflecting a terminology change in the application from "card" to "chunk".

### SQL Migration Script
#### Description
This SQL script contains a series of ALTER TABLE statements that rename tables and columns in the database. The primary purpose is to replace all instances of "card" with "chunk" in table and column names.

#### Internal Logic
The script performs the following operations:
1. Renames tables:
   - `card_collection` to `chunk_collection`
   - `card_collection_bookmarks` to `chunk_collection_bookmarks`
   - `card_collisions` to `chunk_collisions`
   - `card_files` to `chunk_files`
   - `card_metadata` to `chunk_metadata`
   - `card_metadata_counts` to `chunk_metadata_counts`
   - `cut_cards` to `cut_chunks`

2. Renames columns:
   - In `card_collection_bookmarks`: `card_metadata_id` to `chunk_metadata_id`
   - In `card_collisions`: `card_id` to `chunk_id`
   - In `card_files`: `card_id` to `chunk_id`
   - In `card_metadata`: `card_html` to `chunk_html`
   - In `cut_cards`: `cut_card_content` to `cut_chunk_content`
   - In `stripe_plans`: `card_count` to `chunk_count`

## Side Effects
This migration will modify the database schema, potentially affecting any code or queries that rely on the old table and column names. After applying this migration, all references to "card" in the database schema will be replaced with "chunk".

## Performance Considerations
As this script involves renaming multiple tables and columns, it may temporarily lock the affected tables during the migration process. The impact on performance will depend on the size of the database and the current load. It's recommended to run this migration during a low-traffic period to minimize disruption.

## Dependencies
This script assumes the existence of a SQL database system that supports the ALTER TABLE RENAME syntax. The specific database system (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) is not explicitly stated in the script.

## TODOs
- Ensure that all application code referencing the old table and column names is updated to use the new "chunk" terminology.
- Update any database views, indexes, or constraints that may reference the renamed tables or columns.
- Test the application thoroughly after applying this migration to catch any missed references to the old naming convention.
