## High-level description
This SQL migration script renames various database tables and columns, changing references from "card" to "chunk". The script is designed to update the database schema, reflecting a terminology change in the application from "card" to "chunk".

### SQL Migration Script
#### Description
This SQL script contains a series of ALTER TABLE statements that rename tables and columns in the database. The primary purpose is to replace all instances of "card" with "chunk" in table and column names.

#### Internal Logic
The script performs the following operations:
1. Renames tables:
   - `card_collection` to `chunk_collection`
   - `card_collection_bookmarks` to `chunk_collection_bookmarks`
   - `card_collisions` to `chunk_collisions`
   - `card_files` to `chunk_files`
   - `card_metadata` to `chunk_metadata`
   - `card_metadata_counts` to `chunk_metadata_counts`
   - `cut_cards` to `cut_chunks`

2. Renames columns:
   - In `card_collection_bookmarks`: `card_metadata_id` to `chunk_metadata_id`
   - In `card_collisions`: `card_id` to `chunk_id`
   - In `card_files`: `card_id` to `chunk_id`
   - In `card_metadata`: `card_html` to `chunk_html`
   - In `cut_cards`: `cut_card_content` to `cut_chunk_content`
   - In `stripe_plans`: `card_count` to `chunk_count`

## Side Effects
This migration will modify the database schema, potentially affecting any code or queries that rely on the old table and column names. After applying this migration, all references to "card" in the database schema will be replaced with "chunk".

## Performance Considerations
While this migration doesn't involve data manipulation, it may temporarily lock the affected tables during the renaming process. The impact on performance will depend on the size of the database and the current load. It's recommended to run this migration during a low-traffic period to minimize disruption.

## Dependencies
This script assumes the existence of a SQL database system that supports the ALTER TABLE statements used (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL). The specific syntax used here is compatible with most modern relational database management systems.

## Error Handling
The script does not include explicit error handling. If any of the tables or columns do not exist, the corresponding ALTER TABLE statement will fail. It's important to ensure that the database is in the expected state before running this migration.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the provided code. However, after applying this migration, it's important to update any application code, ORM configurations, or other database queries that reference the old table and column names to use the new "chunk" terminology.
