## High-level description
This SQL script is designed to revert the changes made in a previous migration that renamed various database entities from "card" to "chunk". It renames tables, columns, and related entities back to their original "card" naming convention.

### SQL Statements
#### Description
The file contains a series of SQL ALTER statements that rename tables and columns in the database.

#### Internal Logic
The script performs the following operations:
1. Renames the "chunk_count" column back to "card_count" in the "stripe_plans" table.
2. Renames several tables from their "chunk" versions back to "card" versions:
   - "cut_chunks" to "cut_cards"
   - "chunk_metadata" to "card_metadata"
   - "chunk_metadata_counts" to "card_metadata_counts"
   - "chunk_files" to "card_files"
   - "chunk_collisions" to "card_collisions"
   - "chunk_collection_bookmarks" to "card_collection_bookmarks"
   - "chunk_collection" to "card_collection"
3. Renames specific columns within these tables to revert from "chunk" to "card" terminology:
   - "cut_chunk_content" to "cut_card_content" in the "cut_cards" table
   - "chunk_html" to "card_html" in the "card_metadata" table
   - "chunk_id" to "card_id" in the "card_files" and "card_collisions" tables
   - "chunk_metadata_id" to "card_metadata_id" in the "card_collection_bookmarks" table

## Side Effects
Executing this script will modify the database schema, reverting table and column names from "chunk" to "card". This will affect any application code or queries that rely on the "chunk" naming convention introduced in the previous migration.

## Dependencies
This script depends on the existence of the tables and columns it's trying to rename. It assumes that the "up.sql" migration was previously applied to rename from "card" to "chunk".

## Error Handling
The script does not include explicit error handling. If any of the tables or columns do not exist, the SQL statements will fail, potentially leaving the database in an inconsistent state.

## Notes
1. This is a database migration "down" script, intended to revert changes made by a corresponding "up" migration.
2. The comment at the top of the file indicates that this script should undo anything done in the `up.sql` file.
3. Care should be taken when applying this migration, as it may break application code that expects the "chunk" naming convention.
4. It's important to ensure that this script is run in a controlled environment, possibly with a database backup in place, to prevent data loss or inconsistencies.
