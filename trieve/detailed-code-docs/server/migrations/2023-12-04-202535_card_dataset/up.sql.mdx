### `datasets` table
#### Description
This SQL statement creates a new table named `datasets` with the following columns:

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a table definition, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a table definition, not a function.

#### Internal Logic
- `id`: A `UUID` (Universally Unique Identifier) that serves as the primary key for the table. It's set to be automatically generated upon row insertion using `gen_random_uuid()`.
- `name`: A `TEXT` field intended to store the name of the dataset. It's marked as `NOT NULL`, enforcing that every dataset must have a name.
- `created_at`: A `TIMESTAMP` field recording when the dataset entry was created. It defaults to the current timestamp (`NOW()`) at the time of insertion.
- `updated_at`: A `TIMESTAMP` field tracking the last update to the dataset entry. Like `created_at`, it defaults to the current timestamp upon insertion and is expected to be updated whenever the dataset information is modified.
