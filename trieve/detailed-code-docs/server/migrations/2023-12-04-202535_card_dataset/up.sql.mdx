### `datasets` table
#### Description
Defines the structure for the `datasets` table, which stores information about individual datasets.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a table definition, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a table definition, not a function.

#### Internal Logic
- **`id`**: A UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) that serves as the primary key for the table, ensuring each dataset has a unique identifier. It's set to be generated automatically using `gen_random_uuid()` function.
- **`name`**: A TEXT field to store the name of the dataset. It's marked as `NOT NULL`, making it a required field.
- **`created_at`**: A TIMESTAMP field that records when the dataset entry was created. It defaults to the current timestamp (`NOW()`).
- **`updated_at`**: A TIMESTAMP field tracking the last update to the dataset entry. It also defaults to the current timestamp (`NOW()`).
