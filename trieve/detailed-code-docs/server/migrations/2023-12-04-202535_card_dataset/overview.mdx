## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for implementing a "datasets" feature in the database schema. The migration introduces a new `datasets` table and adds `dataset_id` columns to existing tables to associate cards and card collections with specific datasets.

## What does it do?
The migration scripts in this directory perform the following actions:

1. Create a new `datasets` table to store information about individual datasets, including a unique identifier, name, and timestamps for creation and last update.
2. Add a `dataset_id` column to the `card_metadata`, `card_collection`, and `card_collection_bookmarks` tables, allowing these entities to be associated with specific datasets.
3. Provide a way to revert these changes by dropping the `datasets` table and removing the `dataset_id` columns from the affected tables.

These changes enable the application to organize and categorize cards and card collections into distinct datasets, which can be useful for managing large collections of data or separating content for different purposes or user groups.

## Key Files

### up.sql
This file contains the SQL commands to implement the new dataset feature:

```sql
CREATE TABLE datasets (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

ALTER TABLE card_metadata ADD COLUMN dataset_id UUID REFERENCES datasets(id);
ALTER TABLE card_collection ADD COLUMN dataset_id UUID REFERENCES datasets(id);
ALTER TABLE card_collection_bookmarks ADD COLUMN dataset_id UUID REFERENCES datasets(id);
```

The script creates the `datasets` table with fields for `id`, `name`, `created_at`, and `updated_at`. It then adds a `dataset_id` column to the `card_metadata`, `card_collection`, and `card_collection_bookmarks` tables, establishing a foreign key relationship with the `datasets` table.

### down.sql
This file contains the SQL commands to revert the changes made by the `up.sql` script:

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS datasets;
ALTER TABLE card_metadata DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS dataset_id;
ALTER TABLE card_collection DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS dataset_id;
ALTER TABLE card_collection_bookmarks DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS dataset_id;
```

The script drops the `datasets` table and removes the `dataset_id` column from the `card_metadata`, `card_collection`, and `card_collection_bookmarks` tables. The `IF EXISTS` clauses ensure that the script doesn't fail if the table or columns don't exist.

## Configuration
The migration scripts don't require any specific configuration. They are designed to be run as part of a database migration process, typically managed by an ORM or migration tool. The exact method of running these migrations would depend on the application's setup and the tools used for database management.

When implementing this feature in the application code, developers should ensure that:

1. The application's database connection is properly configured to execute these migrations.
2. Any code interacting with cards, card collections, or bookmarks is updated to handle the new `dataset_id` field.
3. New functionality is added to create, read, update, and delete datasets as needed.
4. The application's data access layer is updated to filter cards and collections by dataset when appropriate.

It's important to note that this migration doesn't handle the population of data for existing records. If there are existing cards, collections, or bookmarks in the database, a separate data migration script may be needed to associate them with appropriate datasets.
