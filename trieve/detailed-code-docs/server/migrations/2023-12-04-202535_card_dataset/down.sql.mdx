title: "down.sql"

## High-level description
This SQL script contains database migration commands to reverse the changes introduced by the `up.sql` migration file, specifically related to a "datasets" feature. It drops the `datasets` table and removes the `dataset_id` column from the `card_metadata`, `card_collection`, and `card_collection_bookmarks` tables. 

This effectively undoes the association of cards and card collections with datasets, reverting the database schema to a state prior to the introduction of the "datasets" feature.

## Code Structure
The code consists of a series of SQL `ALTER TABLE` and `DROP TABLE` statements that are executed sequentially to undo the database schema changes. 

## Symbols

### `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS datasets;`
#### Description
This SQL statement attempts to drop the `datasets` table. The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the statement executes successfully even if the `datasets` table doesn't exist.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Check for existence:** The database checks if a table named `datasets` exists.
2. **Drop if exists:** If the `datasets` table exists, it is permanently deleted along with all its data.
3. **No action if not exists:** If the `datasets` table doesn't exist, no action is taken.

### `ALTER TABLE card_metadata DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS dataset_id;`
#### Description
This SQL statement removes the `dataset_id` column from the `card_metadata` table if it exists.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Check for column existence:** The database checks if a column named `dataset_id` exists in the `card_metadata` table.
2. **Drop column if exists:** If the `dataset_id` column exists, it is permanently removed from the `card_metadata` table.
3. **No action if not exists:** If the `dataset_id` column doesn't exist, no action is taken.

### `ALTER TABLE card_collection DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS dataset_id;`
#### Description
This SQL statement removes the `dataset_id` column from the `card_collection` table if it exists. The logic is identical to the previous statement, but applied to the `card_collection` table.

### `ALTER TABLE card_collection_bookmarks DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS dataset_id;`
#### Description
This SQL statement removes the `dataset_id` column from the `card_collection_bookmarks` table if it exists. The logic is identical to the previous statement, but applied to the `card_collection_bookmarks` table.
