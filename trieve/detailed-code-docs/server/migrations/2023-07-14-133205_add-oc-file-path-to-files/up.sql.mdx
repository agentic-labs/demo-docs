## High-level description
This SQL migration file adds a new column named `oc_file_path` to the `files` table. The column is designed to store the file path for OpenCore (OC) files, allowing for null values.

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE files
#### Description
This SQL command modifies the structure of the existing `files` table by adding a new column.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `ALTER TABLE` statement is used to modify the `files` table.
2. The `ADD COLUMN` clause specifies that a new column is being added to the table.
3. The new column is named `oc_file_path`.
4. The data type of the new column is set to `TEXT`, which allows for storing string data of variable length.
5. The `NULL` keyword indicates that this column can contain null values, meaning it's optional and doesn't require a value for every row.

## Side Effects
- This migration will modify the schema of the `files` table in the database.
- Existing rows in the `files` table will have a `NULL` value in the new `oc_file_path` column.
- Any applications or queries that rely on the structure of the `files` table will need to be updated to account for this new column.

## Performance Considerations
- Adding a new column to an existing table with a large number of rows can be a potentially time-consuming operation, depending on the database system and the amount of data in the table.
- The operation might require a table lock, which could temporarily impact the availability of the `files` table for other operations.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in this migration file. However, it's worth noting that after applying this migration, the application code that interacts with the `files` table may need to be updated to utilize the new `oc_file_path` column as needed.
