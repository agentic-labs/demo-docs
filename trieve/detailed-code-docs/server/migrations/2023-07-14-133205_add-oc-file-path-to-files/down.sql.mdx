## High-level description
This SQL script reverts the database migration defined in the corresponding `up.sql` file. Specifically, it removes the `oc_file_path` column from the `files` table.

## References
- `up.sql`: This script undoes the changes introduced by the `up.sql` migration script.

## Symbols
### `ALTER TABLE files DROP COLUMN oc_file_path;`
#### Description
This SQL statement removes the `oc_file_path` column from the `files` table.

#### Internal Logic
- `ALTER TABLE files`: This clause initiates the modification of the `files` table structure.
- `DROP COLUMN oc_file_path`: This clause specifies the action to perform, which is to remove (drop) the column named `oc_file_path`.

#### Side Effects
- **Database Schema Change:** This statement directly modifies the database schema by removing a column from the `files` table. Any data previously stored in the `oc_file_path` column will be permanently deleted.
