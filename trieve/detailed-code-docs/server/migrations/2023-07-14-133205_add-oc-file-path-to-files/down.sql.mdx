title: "down.sql"

## High-level description
This SQL migration file is designed to undo the changes made by the corresponding `up.sql` file. It removes the `oc_file_path` column from the `files` table in the database.

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE files
#### Description
This SQL command modifies the structure of the `files` table by removing a specific column.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `ALTER TABLE` statement is used to modify the `files` table.
2. The `DROP COLUMN` clause is used to remove the `oc_file_path` column from the table.

## Side Effects
- This migration will permanently remove the `oc_file_path` column and all its data from the `files` table.
- Any queries or application code that previously relied on the `oc_file_path` column will no longer work after this migration is applied.

## Performance Considerations
Dropping a column is generally a fast operation, but it may take longer if the table contains a large number of rows. The exact performance impact depends on the database system being used and the size of the `files` table.

## TODOs
The comment at the top of the file suggests that this migration should undo anything done in the corresponding `up.sql` file. It's important to ensure that this `down.sql` file correctly reverses all changes made in the `up.sql` file to maintain database consistency when rolling back migrations.
