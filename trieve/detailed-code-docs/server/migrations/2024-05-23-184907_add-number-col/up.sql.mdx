## High-level description
This SQL migration script adds a new floating-point column to the `chunk_metadata` table and creates an index on that column. The script is designed to enhance the database schema by introducing a numeric value field and optimizing queries on this new column.

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE chunk_metadata ADD COLUMN num_value float8;
#### Description
This SQL command adds a new column named `num_value` to the existing `chunk_metadata` table. The new column is of type `float8`, which is a double-precision floating-point number.

#### Internal Logic
1. Identifies the `chunk_metadata` table.
2. Adds a new column named `num_value`.
3. Sets the data type of the new column to `float8` (64-bit floating-point).

### CREATE INDEX idx_num_val_chunk_metadata ON chunk_metadata USING btree (num_value);
#### Description
This SQL command creates a new index on the `num_value` column of the `chunk_metadata` table. The index is named `idx_num_val_chunk_metadata` and uses a B-tree data structure for efficient querying.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a new index named `idx_num_val_chunk_metadata`.
2. Specifies the table `chunk_metadata` on which the index is created.
3. Uses the B-tree indexing method, which is efficient for range queries and sorting.
4. Applies the index to the `num_value` column.

## Performance Considerations
The addition of the B-tree index on the `num_value` column will improve query performance for operations that involve sorting, range queries, or equality comparisons on this column. However, it may slightly impact the performance of insert and update operations on the `chunk_metadata` table, as the index will need to be updated along with the table data.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| PostgreSQL | This SQL script is written for PostgreSQL databases, as evidenced by the use of the `float8` data type, which is specific to PostgreSQL. |

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in this migration script. However, it's worth noting that this is an "up" migration script, and there should be a corresponding "down" migration script to revert these changes if needed.
