## High-level description
This SQL script defines a database migration that adds a new column named `num_value` of type `float8` (double precision floating-point number) to the table `chunk_metadata`. It also creates a B-tree index on this new column to speed up queries that filter or order by `num_value`.

## Symbols

### `ALTER TABLE chunk_metadata ADD COLUMN num_value float8;`
#### Description
This statement adds a new column named `num_value` to the existing table `chunk_metadata`. The data type of the new column is `float8`, which represents a double-precision floating-point number.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a SQL statement, not a function with inputs.

#### Outputs
N/A - This statement modifies the database schema, it doesn't return any output.

#### Side Effects
- Adds a new column `num_value` to the table `chunk_metadata`.

### `CREATE INDEX idx_num_val_chunk_metadata ON chunk_metadata USING btree (num_value);`
#### Description
This statement creates a new index named `idx_num_val_chunk_metadata` on the `chunk_metadata` table. The index is created using the B-tree algorithm and is applied to the `num_value` column.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a SQL statement, not a function with inputs.

#### Outputs
N/A - This statement modifies the database schema, it doesn't return any output.

#### Side Effects
- Creates a new index `idx_num_val_chunk_metadata` on the `chunk_metadata` table. This index will speed up queries that filter or order by the `num_value` column.
#### Performance Considerations
Creating an index can improve the performance of queries that use the indexed column in their WHERE, ORDER BY, or JOIN clauses. However, indexes also consume storage space and can slightly slow down data insertion and updates.
