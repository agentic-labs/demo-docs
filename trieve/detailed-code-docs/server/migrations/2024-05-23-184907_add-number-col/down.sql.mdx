## High-level description
This SQL script defines a database migration that reverts changes introduced by a corresponding "up" migration. Specifically, it removes a column named `num_value` from the `chunk_metadata` table and drops an index associated with that column.

## Symbols

### `ALTER TABLE chunk_metadata DROP COLUMN num_value;`
#### Description
This statement removes the `num_value` column from the `chunk_metadata` table.

#### Side Effects
This operation modifies the database schema by deleting a column. Data previously stored in the `num_value` column will be permanently lost.

### `DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_num_val_chunk_metadata;`
#### Description
This statement attempts to drop an index named `idx_num_val_chunk_metadata`. The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the statement executes successfully even if the index does not exist.

#### Side Effects
This operation modifies the database by deleting an index, which may impact the performance of queries that previously utilized the index.
