## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for adding a new column `num_value` to the `chunk_metadata` table in a database. The migration includes both "up" and "down" scripts to apply and revert the changes respectively. These scripts are part of a database versioning system, allowing for controlled and reversible modifications to the database schema.

## What does it do?
The migration scripts in this directory perform the following actions:

1. Add a new column:
   - A new column called `num_value` of type `float8` (double precision floating-point number) is added to the `chunk_metadata` table. This column can store numerical values associated with each chunk of metadata.

2. Create an index:
   - A B-tree index named `idx_num_val_chunk_metadata` is created on the new `num_value` column. This index will improve the performance of queries that filter or sort by this column.

3. Provide a way to revert changes:
   - The "down" migration script allows for the removal of the newly added column and its associated index, effectively undoing the changes made by the "up" script.

These changes enable the storage and efficient querying of numerical values associated with chunk metadata, which could be used for various purposes such as sorting, filtering, or calculations based on these values.

## Key Files

1. `up.sql`:
   This file contains the SQL statements to apply the migration. It adds the `num_value` column to the `chunk_metadata` table and creates an index on this column.

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE chunk_metadata ADD COLUMN num_value float8;
   CREATE INDEX idx_num_val_chunk_metadata ON chunk_metadata USING btree (num_value);
   ```

2. `down.sql`:
   This file contains the SQL statements to revert the migration. It removes the `num_value` column from the `chunk_metadata` table and drops the associated index.

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE chunk_metadata DROP COLUMN num_value;
   DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_num_val_chunk_metadata;
   ```

These files work together to provide a reversible database schema change, allowing developers to apply or roll back the addition of the `num_value` column as needed.

## Configuration
The migration is identified by its timestamp-based directory name: `2024-05-23-184907_add-number-col`. This naming convention is likely used by a database migration tool to determine the order in which migrations should be applied or reverted.

No additional configuration files or environment variables are required for this specific migration. However, the database connection details and migration tool settings would typically be configured elsewhere in the project.
