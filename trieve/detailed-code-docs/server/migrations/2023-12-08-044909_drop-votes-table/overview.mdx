## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for dropping the `card_votes` table in a database. It consists of two files: `up.sql` for applying the migration (dropping the table) and `down.sql` for reverting the migration (recreating the table).

## What does it do?
The migration scripts in this directory perform the following actions:

1. The `up.sql` script removes the `card_votes` table from the database. This action deletes all vote data associated with cards, effectively removing the voting functionality from the system.

2. The `down.sql` script provides a way to undo this change by recreating the `card_votes` table with its original structure and indexes. This allows for the restoration of the voting functionality if needed.

These scripts are part of a database migration process, allowing developers to manage and version control changes to the database schema over time.

## Key Files

### up.sql
This file contains the SQL command to drop the `card_votes` table:

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS card_votes;
```

This command removes the `card_votes` table if it exists, along with all its data and associated indexes.

### down.sql
This file contains the SQL commands to recreate the `card_votes` table and its indexes:

```sql
CREATE TABLE card_votes (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    voted_user_id UUID NOT NULL,
    card_metadata_id UUID NOT NULL,
    vote BOOLEAN NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (voted_user_id) REFERENCES users(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (card_metadata_id) REFERENCES card_metadata(id)
);

CREATE INDEX idx_card_votes_voted_user_id ON card_votes (voted_user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_card_votes_card_metadata_id ON card_votes (card_metadata_id);
```

This script recreates the `card_votes` table with the following structure:
- `id`: A UUID primary key for unique vote identification
- `voted_user_id`: A UUID referencing the user who cast the vote
- `card_metadata_id`: A UUID referencing the card that received the vote
- `vote`: A boolean representing the vote (likely true for upvote, false for downvote)
- `created_at` and `updated_at`: Timestamps for vote creation and last update

It also creates two indexes to optimize queries:
1. An index on `voted_user_id` for efficient user-based vote queries
2. An index on `card_metadata_id` for efficient card-based vote queries

## Configuration
The migration scripts do not require any additional configuration. They are designed to be run as part of a database migration process, typically managed by an ORM or migration tool.

## Dependencies
These SQL scripts don't have direct dependencies on external libraries. However, they assume the existence of:

1. A `users` table, referenced by the `voted_user_id` foreign key
2. A `card_metadata` table, referenced by the `card_metadata_id` foreign key

The scripts are written in standard SQL and should be compatible with PostgreSQL, given the use of UUID data types and the `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` default value.

## Side Effects
It's important to note that running the `up.sql` migration will result in the permanent deletion of all data in the `card_votes` table. This action is irreversible unless you have a backup of the data or run the `down.sql` script to recreate the table structure (though the data will still be lost).

Developers should exercise caution when applying this migration in production environments and ensure that any necessary data has been backed up or migrated to a new structure if required.
