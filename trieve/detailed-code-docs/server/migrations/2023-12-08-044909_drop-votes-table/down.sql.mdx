## High-level description
This SQL script defines the "down" migration for reverting changes introduced by a corresponding "up" migration related to a table named `card_votes`. It aims to recreate the `card_votes` table and its associated indexes that were likely dropped in the "up" migration.

## Symbols

### `CREATE TABLE card_votes`
#### Description
This statement recreates the `card_votes` table, which stores information about votes cast on cards by users.

#### Internal Logic
- The table has the following columns:
    - `id`: A UUID serving as the primary key for uniquely identifying each vote.
    - `voted_user_id`: A UUID referencing the `users` table, indicating the user who cast the vote.
    - `card_metadata_id`: A UUID referencing the `card_metadata` table, indicating the card that received the vote.
    - `vote`: A boolean value representing the vote itself (likely true for upvote, false for downvote).
    - `created_at`: A timestamp recording the vote's creation time, defaulting to the current timestamp.
    - `updated_at`: A timestamp recording the vote's last update time, also defaulting to the current timestamp.

- Foreign key constraints ensure referential integrity with the `users` and `card_metadata` tables.

### `CREATE INDEX idx_card_votes_voted_user_id`
#### Description
This statement creates an index on the `voted_user_id` column of the `card_votes` table.

#### Internal Logic
- This index optimizes queries that filter or search based on the user who cast the vote.

### `CREATE INDEX idx_card_votes_card_metadata_id`
#### Description
This statement creates an index on the `card_metadata_id` column of the `card_votes` table.

#### Internal Logic
- This index optimizes queries that filter or search based on the card that received the vote.
