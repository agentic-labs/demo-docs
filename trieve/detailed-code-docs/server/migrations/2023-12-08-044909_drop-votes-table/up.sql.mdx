## High-level description
This SQL script defines a database migration that drops the `card_votes` table. This migration is irreversible.

## Symbols

### `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS card_votes;`
#### Description
This SQL statement attempts to drop the table named `card_votes`. The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the statement executes successfully even if the table does not exist.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Check for Existence:** The database checks if a table named `card_votes` exists.
2. **Drop Table (If Exists):** If the table exists, it is permanently deleted along with all its data. If the table does not exist, no action is taken. 

## Side Effects
- **Data Loss:** This migration results in the permanent deletion of the `card_votes` table and all associated data.
