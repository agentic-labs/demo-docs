## High-level description
This SQL migration script is designed to drop the `card_votes` table if it exists in the database. It's a simple, single-line operation that removes the table structure and all its data from the database schema.

## Symbols

### `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS card_votes;`
#### Description
This SQL command is used to remove the `card_votes` table from the database schema if it exists.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `IF EXISTS` clause is used to prevent errors if the table doesn't exist.
2. If the `card_votes` table exists, it will be completely removed from the database, including all its data, indexes, and constraints.
3. If the table doesn't exist, the command will complete successfully without making any changes.

## Side Effects
- Permanent deletion of the `card_votes` table and all its contents if it exists.
- This operation cannot be undone unless there's a corresponding down migration to recreate the table.

## Performance Considerations
This operation is typically fast, especially for small to medium-sized tables. However, for very large tables, it might take some time and could potentially lock the database briefly during execution.

## Error Handling
The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the command won't throw an error if the table doesn't exist, making the migration more robust and idempotent.

## TODOs
- Consider creating a corresponding down migration to recreate the `card_votes` table if this change needs to be reversed.
- Ensure that any application code or other database objects that depend on the `card_votes` table are updated accordingly to avoid errors after this migration is applied.
