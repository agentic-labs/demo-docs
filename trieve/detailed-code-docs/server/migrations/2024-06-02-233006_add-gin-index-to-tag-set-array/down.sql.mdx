title: "down.sql"

## High-level description
This SQL script reverts the database migration defined in the corresponding `up.sql` file, specifically by dropping a GIN index named `tag_set_array_idx`. This suggests that the `up.sql` migration likely created this index on a column containing arrays of tag sets.

## Symbols

### `DROP INDEX IF EXISTS tag_set_array_idx;`
#### Description
This SQL statement attempts to drop the index named `tag_set_array_idx`. The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the statement executes successfully even if the index does not exist. This is a common practice in migration rollback scripts to handle cases where the database state might not match the expected state from the migration.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Check for Existence:** The database checks if an index named `tag_set_array_idx` exists.
2. **Conditional Drop:**
   - If the index exists, the `DROP INDEX` command is executed, removing the index from the database.
   - If the index does not exist, the statement completes without taking any action.
