## High-level description
This SQL script reverts the database changes made by the migration `2024-06-02-233006_add-gin-index-to-tag-set-array`. Specifically, it drops the GIN index named `tag_set_array_idx` if it exists.

## Symbols

### `DROP INDEX IF EXISTS tag_set_array_idx;`
#### Description
This SQL statement attempts to drop the index named `tag_set_array_idx`. The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the statement executes successfully even if the index does not exist. This is a common practice in down migrations to handle cases where the up migration might not have been successfully applied.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Check for Existence:** The database checks if an index named `tag_set_array_idx` exists.
2. **Conditional Drop:**
   - If the index exists, the `DROP INDEX` statement is executed, removing the index from the database.
   - If the index does not exist, the statement completes without taking any action.

#### Side Effects
- **Index Removal:** If the `tag_set_array_idx` index exists, it will be removed from the database. This might impact the performance of queries that previously utilized this index.
