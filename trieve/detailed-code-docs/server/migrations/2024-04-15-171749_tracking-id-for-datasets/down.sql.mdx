## High-level description
This SQL migration script is designed to revert the changes made in the corresponding `up.sql` file. It removes the `tracking_id` column from the `datasets` table and drops the associated index.

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE datasets DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS tracking_id;
#### Description
This SQL command removes the `tracking_id` column from the `datasets` table if it exists.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `ALTER TABLE` statement is used to modify the structure of the `datasets` table.
2. `DROP COLUMN` specifies that a column should be removed.
3. `IF EXISTS` is used to prevent errors if the column doesn't exist, making the migration more robust.
4. `tracking_id` is the name of the column being removed.

### DROP INDEX IF EXISTS datasets_tracking_id_idx;
#### Description
This SQL command drops the index named `datasets_tracking_id_idx` if it exists.

#### Internal Logic
1. `DROP INDEX` is used to remove an index from the database.
2. `IF EXISTS` prevents errors if the index doesn't exist, ensuring the migration can be run multiple times without failing.
3. `datasets_tracking_id_idx` is the name of the index being dropped.

## Side Effects
- Removes the `tracking_id` column from the `datasets` table, potentially causing data loss if the column contained important information.
- Drops the index `datasets_tracking_id_idx`, which may impact query performance for operations that previously used this index.

## Performance Considerations
Dropping a column and an index are generally fast operations, but the exact performance impact depends on the size of the table and the database system being used. For large tables, these operations might require a table rewrite, which could be time-consuming.
