## High-level description
This SQL migration script adds a new column `tracking_id` to the `datasets` table, creates a unique constraint on the combination of `organization_id` and `tracking_id`, and adds an index on the `tracking_id` column. These changes enhance the dataset tracking capabilities and improve query performance.

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE datasets ADD COLUMN tracking_id TEXT NULL
#### Description
This SQL statement adds a new column named `tracking_id` to the `datasets` table. The column is of type TEXT and allows NULL values.

#### Internal Logic
- Adds a new column to the existing `datasets` table
- The column name is `tracking_id`
- The data type is TEXT, which allows for storing string values of variable length
- NULL is allowed, meaning the column can contain empty values

### ALTER TABLE datasets ADD CONSTRAINT unique_organization_tracking_id UNIQUE (organization_id, tracking_id)
#### Description
This SQL statement adds a unique constraint to the `datasets` table, ensuring that the combination of `organization_id` and `tracking_id` is unique across all rows.

#### Internal Logic
- Creates a new constraint named `unique_organization_tracking_id`
- Applies the constraint to the `datasets` table
- Ensures that no two rows can have the same combination of `organization_id` and `tracking_id`
- Allows for multiple NULL values in the `tracking_id` column, as NULL is not considered equal to another NULL in uniqueness constraints

### CREATE INDEX datasets_tracking_id_idx ON datasets (tracking_id)
#### Description
This SQL statement creates an index on the `tracking_id` column of the `datasets` table to improve query performance when searching or filtering by `tracking_id`.

#### Internal Logic
- Creates a new index named `datasets_tracking_id_idx`
- Applies the index to the `datasets` table
- Indexes the `tracking_id` column
- Improves performance for queries that involve searching, filtering, or sorting by `tracking_id`

## Performance Considerations
- The addition of the `tracking_id` column may slightly increase storage requirements for the `datasets` table.
- The unique constraint on `(organization_id, tracking_id)` ensures data integrity but may have a small impact on insert and update operations.
- The index on `tracking_id` will improve query performance for operations involving this column but may slightly slow down insert and update operations.

## Error Handling
This migration script does not include explicit error handling. If any of the operations fail, the database management system will typically roll back the entire transaction, leaving the database in its previous state.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in this migration script.
