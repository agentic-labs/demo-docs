title: "down.sql"

## High-level description
This SQL migration file is designed to revert the changes made in the corresponding `up.sql` file. It removes the `deleted` column from the `organizations` table and drops the associated index, effectively undoing a soft delete implementation for organizations.

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE organizations DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS deleted;
#### Description
This SQL command removes the `deleted` column from the `organizations` table if it exists.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the `deleted` column exists in the `organizations` table.
2. If the column exists, it is removed from the table structure.
3. If the column doesn't exist, the command has no effect, preventing errors.

### DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_organization_deleted;
#### Description
This SQL command drops the index named `idx_organization_deleted` if it exists.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the index `idx_organization_deleted` exists.
2. If the index exists, it is removed from the database.
3. If the index doesn't exist, the command has no effect, preventing errors.

## Side Effects
- Removes the `deleted` column from the `organizations` table, which may result in the loss of soft delete information.
- Drops the index `idx_organization_deleted`, which may impact query performance for operations that were using this index.

## Performance Considerations
Dropping a column and an index are typically fast operations, but they may briefly lock the table during execution. The impact on a production system would depend on the size of the table and the current load on the database.

## Error Handling
The SQL commands use `IF EXISTS` clauses to prevent errors if the column or index doesn't exist. This makes the migration more robust and idempotent, allowing it to be run multiple times without causing errors.
