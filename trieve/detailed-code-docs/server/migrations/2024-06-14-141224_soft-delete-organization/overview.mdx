## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration files for implementing a soft delete functionality for organizations in the database. It consists of two files: `up.sql` and `down.sql`, which are responsible for applying and reverting the changes respectively.

## What does it do?
The migration adds a new column called `deleted` to the `organizations` table, allowing for logical deletion of organization records without physically removing them from the database. This is known as a "soft delete" approach. When an organization is "deleted", instead of removing the record, the `deleted` column is set to a non-zero value (presumably 1, though this is not explicitly defined in the migration).

The migration also creates an index on the `deleted` column to improve query performance when filtering organizations based on their deletion status.

The `down.sql` file provides the ability to undo these changes, removing the `deleted` column and its associated index if needed.

## Key Files

1. `up.sql`:
   - Adds the `deleted` column to the `organizations` table:
     ```sql
     ALTER TABLE organizations
     ADD COLUMN deleted INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0;
     ```
   - Creates an index on the `deleted` column:
     ```sql
     CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_organization_deleted
     ON organizations (deleted);
     ```

2. `down.sql`:
   - Removes the `deleted` column from the `organizations` table:
     ```sql
     ALTER TABLE organizations DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS deleted;
     ```
   - Drops the index created on the `deleted` column:
     ```sql
     DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_organization_deleted;
     ```

## Configuration
This migration does not require any specific configuration. It is designed to be run by a database migration tool, which would typically be configured elsewhere in the project.

## Performance Considerations
The addition of the `deleted` column with a default value should be a relatively quick operation, even on large tables, as it doesn't require updating existing data. However, creating an index can be more time-consuming on tables with a large number of rows, as it needs to process all existing data.

The new index will slightly slow down insert and update operations on the `organizations` table but will significantly speed up queries that filter on the `deleted` column. This trade-off is generally beneficial for soft delete implementations, as it allows for efficient querying of non-deleted (active) organizations.

When reverting the migration, dropping a column and an index are typically fast operations, but they may briefly lock the table during execution. The impact on a production system would depend on the size of the table and the current load on the database.

## Error Handling
Both migration files use `IF EXISTS` clauses in their SQL commands to prevent errors if the column or index doesn't exist when trying to remove them. This makes the migration more robust and idempotent, allowing it to be run multiple times without causing errors.

However, there is no explicit error handling within the SQL scripts themselves. Any errors that occur during the execution of these SQL commands will be handled by the database management system or the migration tool being used.

In conclusion, this migration implements a soft delete feature for organizations, providing a way to logically delete records without physically removing them from the database. This approach offers benefits in terms of data recovery and maintaining referential integrity while still allowing for efficient querying of active organizations.
