## High-level description
This SQL migration script adds a soft delete functionality to the `organizations` table by introducing a `deleted` column and creating an index on it. This allows for logical deletion of organization records without physically removing them from the database.

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE organizations
#### Description
This SQL command modifies the structure of the `organizations` table by adding a new column named `deleted`.

#### Internal Logic
- Adds a new column `deleted` to the `organizations` table
- Sets the data type of the column to `INT` (integer)
- Applies a default value of `0` to the column
- Makes the column `NOT NULL`, ensuring it always has a value

### CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_organization_deleted
#### Description
This SQL command creates an index on the newly added `deleted` column of the `organizations` table to improve query performance when filtering by the deletion status.

#### Internal Logic
- Creates an index named `idx_organization_deleted` if it doesn't already exist
- The index is created on the `deleted` column of the `organizations` table

## Side Effects
- Modifies the structure of the `organizations` table
- Adds a new column to all existing rows in the `organizations` table
- Creates a new index in the database, which may impact storage and future insert/update performance (slightly) while improving read performance for queries filtering on the `deleted` column

## Performance Considerations
- The addition of the `deleted` column with a default value should be a relatively quick operation, even on tables with many rows, as it doesn't require updating existing data
- Creating an index can be more time-consuming, especially on tables with a large number of rows, as it needs to process all existing data
- The new index will slightly slow down insert and update operations on the `organizations` table but will significantly speed up queries that filter on the `deleted` column

## Error Handling
This migration script does not include explicit error handling. If an error occurs during execution (e.g., if the table or column already exists), the database management system will handle it according to its default behavior, typically rolling back the changes and reporting the error.
