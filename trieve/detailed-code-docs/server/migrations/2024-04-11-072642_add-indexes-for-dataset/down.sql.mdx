## High-level description
This SQL script contains database migration commands to revert changes introduced by a corresponding `up.sql` migration file, specifically related to dropping indexes associated with datasets and stripe subscriptions. 

## Symbols

### `ALTER TABLE datasets DROP INDEX datasets_organization_id_index;`
#### Description
This SQL statement removes an index named `datasets_organization_id_index` from the `datasets` table. This index was likely created in the `up.sql` migration to optimize queries that filter or join based on the `organization_id` column. 

#### Side Effects
- **Reduced query performance:** Dropping the index may lead to slower performance for queries that frequently filter or join on the `organization_id` column in the `datasets` table.

### `ALTER TABLE stripe_subscriptions DROP INDEX stripe_subscriptions_plan_id_index;`
#### Description
Similar to the previous statement, this line drops the `stripe_subscriptions_plan_id_index` from the `stripe_subscriptions` table. This index likely sped up queries related to the `plan_id` column.

#### Side Effects
- **Reduced query performance:** Removing this index might decrease the speed of queries that use the `plan_id` column in the `stripe_subscriptions` table for filtering or joining.
