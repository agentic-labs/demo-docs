## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for adding and removing indexes on specific columns in the `datasets` and `stripe_subscriptions` tables. The migration is dated 2024-04-11 and is designed to improve query performance for these tables.

## What does it do?
The migration scripts in this directory perform the following actions:

1. In the "up" migration:
   - Creates an index on the `organization_id` column of the `datasets` table.
   - Creates an index on the `plan_id` column of the `stripe_subscriptions` table.

2. In the "down" migration:
   - Removes the index on the `organization_id` column of the `datasets` table.
   - Removes the index on the `plan_id` column of the `stripe_subscriptions` table.

These changes are intended to optimize database queries that frequently filter or join on these columns, potentially improving the overall performance of the application.

## Key Files

### up.sql
This file contains the SQL commands to create the new indexes:

```sql
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS datasets_organization_id_index ON datasets (organization_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS stripe_subscriptions_plan_id_index ON stripe_subscriptions (plan_id);
```

The `IF NOT EXISTS` clause is used to prevent errors if the indexes already exist, making the migration idempotent.

### down.sql
This file contains the SQL commands to remove the indexes created by the up migration:

```sql
ALTER TABLE datasets DROP INDEX datasets_organization_id_index;
ALTER TABLE stripe_subscriptions DROP INDEX stripe_subscriptions_plan_id_index;
```

These commands will revert the changes made by the up migration, removing the indexes from their respective tables.

## Performance Considerations
Adding indexes can significantly improve query performance, especially for large tables and frequently used columns in WHERE clauses or JOIN conditions. However, it's important to note that indexes also have some trade-offs:

1. Increased storage space: Indexes require additional disk space to store the index structure.
2. Slower write operations: Inserting, updating, or deleting data in indexed columns may be slightly slower due to the need to update the index structure.
3. Maintenance overhead: Indexes need to be maintained and potentially rebuilt over time to remain effective.

In this case, the benefits of faster queries on `organization_id` for datasets and `plan_id` for stripe subscriptions are likely to outweigh these potential drawbacks, especially if these columns are frequently used in queries.

## Configuration
This migration does not require any specific configuration. It is designed to be run as part of a database migration process, typically managed by an ORM or migration tool in the application's backend.

The naming convention of the directory (2024-04-11-072642_add-indexes-for-dataset) suggests that this migration is part of a versioned migration system, where the timestamp in the directory name determines the order in which migrations are applied.
