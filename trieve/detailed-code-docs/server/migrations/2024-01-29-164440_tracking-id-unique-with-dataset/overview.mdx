## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for modifying the `chunk_metadata` table in a database. The migration changes the uniqueness constraint on the `tracking_id` column to include the `dataset_id` column, allowing for tracking IDs to be unique within the scope of a dataset rather than globally unique.

## What does it do?
The migration scripts in this directory perform the following actions:

1. In the "up" direction (applying the migration):
   - It removes the existing unique constraint on the `tracking_id` column of the `chunk_metadata` table.
   - It adds a new unique constraint that combines both `tracking_id` and `dataset_id` columns.

2. In the "down" direction (reverting the migration):
   - It removes the combined unique constraint on `tracking_id` and `dataset_id`.
   - It restores the original unique constraint on just the `tracking_id` column.

This change allows the system to have duplicate `tracking_id` values across different datasets, while still ensuring uniqueness within each dataset. This can be useful in scenarios where tracking IDs are generated or managed independently for different datasets but need to be unique within their respective contexts.

## Key Files

### up.sql
This file contains the SQL commands to apply the migration:

```sql
ALTER TABLE chunk_metadata DROP CONSTRAINT card_metadata_tracking_id_key;
ALTER TABLE chunk_metadata ADD CONSTRAINT chunk_metadata_tracking_id_dataset_id_key UNIQUE (tracking_id, dataset_id);
```

The first command drops the existing unique constraint on `tracking_id`, and the second command adds a new unique constraint on the combination of `tracking_id` and `dataset_id`.

### down.sql
This file contains the SQL commands to revert the migration:

```sql
ALTER TABLE chunk_metadata DROP CONSTRAINT chunk_metadata_tracking_id_dataset_id_key;
ALTER TABLE chunk_metadata ADD CONSTRAINT card_metadata_tracking_id_key UNIQUE (tracking_id);
```

The first command removes the combined unique constraint, and the second command restores the original unique constraint on just `tracking_id`.

## Configuration
The migration is identified by its timestamp: `2024-01-29-164440`. This timestamp is likely used by a migration management system to track which migrations have been applied and in what order.

It's worth noting that the constraint names in the `up.sql` and `down.sql` files are slightly inconsistent:
- The original constraint is named `card_metadata_tracking_id_key`, which suggests that the table might have been renamed from `card_metadata` to `chunk_metadata` at some point.
- The new constraint is named `chunk_metadata_tracking_id_dataset_id_key`, which follows the current table name.

This inconsistency doesn't affect the functionality but might be worth addressing for clarity and maintainability in future migrations.
