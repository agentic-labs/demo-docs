title: "down.sql"

## High-level description
This SQL migration file is designed to undo the changes made in the corresponding `up.sql` file. Specifically, it removes an index that was previously created on the `card_verification` table for the `card_id` column.

## Symbols

### DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_card_verification_card_id
#### Description
This SQL command removes the index named `idx_card_verification_card_id` if it exists in the database.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `DROP INDEX` command is used to remove an index from the database.
2. The `IF EXISTS` clause is added to prevent errors if the index doesn't exist. This makes the migration more robust and idempotent.
3. The index name `idx_card_verification_card_id` suggests that this index was created on the `card_id` column of the `card_verification` table.

## Side Effects
- Removing this index may impact query performance for operations that were previously using this index on the `card_verification` table, particularly for queries involving the `card_id` column.
- The database size may slightly decrease due to the removal of the index structure.

## Performance Considerations
- After removing this index, queries that were previously using it might become slower, especially if they involve searching or sorting by `card_id` in the `card_verification` table.
- The removal of the index itself is generally a quick operation, but it could momentarily lock the table on some database systems, potentially affecting concurrent operations on the `card_verification` table.

## Notes
- This migration file is part of a database versioning system, allowing for easy rollback of database changes.
- The comment at the top of the file indicates that this script is intended to undo the changes made in the corresponding `up.sql` file.
- It's good practice to test both the `up` and `down` migrations to ensure they work correctly and maintain database integrity.
