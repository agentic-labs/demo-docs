title: "down.sql"

## High-level description
This SQL script reverts the database migration defined in the corresponding `up.sql` file, specifically by removing an index named `idx_card_verification_card_id` from a table, likely related to card verifications. This suggests the `up.sql` file likely added this index, and this script is designed to undo that change during a database rollback.

## Symbols

### `DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_card_verification_card_id;`
#### Description
This SQL statement attempts to drop an index named `idx_card_verification_card_id`. The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the operation won't fail if the index doesn't exist, making the script more robust for scenarios where the index might have already been removed.

#### Internal Logic
- **`DROP INDEX IF EXISTS`**: This is a SQL command used to delete an index from a database table. The `IF EXISTS` clause makes the command conditional; it will only drop the index if it exists.
- **`idx_card_verification_card_id`**: This is the name of the index to be dropped. The naming suggests it was likely created on a column named `card_id` in a table related to "card verification". 

#### Side Effects
- **Index Removal**: If the `idx_card_verification_card_id` index exists, it will be removed from the database. This might impact the performance of queries that relied on this index.
