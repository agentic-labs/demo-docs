## High-level description
This SQL migration file adds an index to the `card_verification` table to improve query performance for lookups based on the `card_id` column.

## Symbols

### CREATE INDEX idx_card_verification_card_id
#### Description
This SQL command creates a new index named `idx_card_verification_card_id` on the `card_verification` table, specifically for the `card_id` column.

#### Internal Logic
The index is created on the `card_id` column of the `card_verification` table. This will enhance the performance of queries that filter or join on the `card_id` column, especially for large datasets.

## Performance Considerations
Adding this index will improve the speed of queries that involve the `card_id` column in the `card_verification` table. However, it may slightly slow down insert, update, and delete operations on this table, as the index will need to be updated along with the table data.

## Dependencies
This migration assumes the existence of a `card_verification` table with a `card_id` column in the database schema.
