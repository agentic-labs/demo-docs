## High-level description
This SQL script adds an index to the `card_verification` table on the `card_id` column when executed. This is typically done to improve the performance of queries that filter or join on this column.

### `CREATE INDEX idx_card_verification_card_id ON card_verification (card_id);`
#### Description
This line of SQL code creates an index named `idx_card_verification_card_id` on the `card_id` column of the `card_verification` table. 

#### Internal Logic
* **`CREATE INDEX`**: This clause is used to create a new index.
* **`idx_card_verification_card_id`**: This is the name assigned to the new index.
* **`ON card_verification`**: This specifies the table on which the index will be created.
* **`(card_id)`**: This defines the column on which the index will be created.

#### Side Effects
* **Improved query performance**:  Queries that filter or join on the `card_id` column are likely to be faster after this index is created.
* **Increased storage space**: Indexes require additional storage space.
* **Potential impact on write operations**:  While reading data generally becomes faster with indexes, writing data (inserts, updates, deletes) might become slightly slower as the index needs to be updated as well.
