## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration files for creating and managing an `invitations` table in a database. The migration is timestamped 2018-10-16-095633, indicating when it was created. The purpose of these migrations is to define the structure for storing invitation data, including fields for unique identifiers, email addresses, expiration dates, and timestamps for creation and updates.

## What does it do?
These migration files allow the application to create and remove a table for managing invitations in the database. The `up.sql` file creates the `invitations` table with specific fields and constraints, while the `down.sql` file provides the ability to remove this table if needed. This setup enables the application to:

1. Store invitation data with unique identifiers (UUIDs).
2. Associate invitations with email addresses.
3. Set expiration dates for invitations.
4. Track when invitations were created and last updated.
5. Easily add or remove the invitations feature from the database schema.

## Key Files

### up.sql
This file contains the SQL commands to create the `invitations` table. It defines the table structure with the following fields:

```sql
CREATE TABLE invitations (
    id UUID NOT NULL UNIQUE PRIMARY KEY,
    email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    expires_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL
);
```

Each field serves a specific purpose:
- `id`: A unique identifier for each invitation using UUID.
- `email`: The email address of the invited user (limited to 100 characters).
- `expires_at`: The date and time when the invitation expires.
- `created_at`: The timestamp when the invitation was created.
- `updated_at`: The timestamp when the invitation was last updated.

### down.sql
This file contains the SQL command to remove the `invitations` table:

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS invitations;
```

This command allows the migration to be reversed, removing the `invitations` table if it exists in the database.

## Dependencies
While not explicitly stated, these migration files depend on a database system that supports:
- UUID data type
- TIMESTAMP data type
- VARCHAR data type with length specification

Common database systems like PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQLite would typically support these features.

## Configuration
These migration files don't include any configurable options. The table structure is fixed as defined in the `CREATE TABLE` statement in `up.sql`. However, if configuration is needed in the future, it might involve:

1. Adjusting the length of the `email` field (currently set to 100 characters).
2. Adding or removing fields from the table structure.
3. Modifying constraints on the fields.

## Notes
1. The migrations are part of a larger server application, as indicated by the directory structure (server/migrations/).
2. The timestamp in the directory name (2018-10-16-095633) helps in ordering and tracking database changes.
3. No additional indexes are defined beyond the primary key. Depending on query patterns, adding indexes on `email` or `expires_at` columns might improve performance.
4. There are no foreign key constraints, suggesting this table doesn't directly relate to other tables in the database schema.
5. The `email` field's 100-character limit should be sufficient for most email addresses but could potentially cause issues with extremely long addresses.
6. Error handling in these migrations relies on the database system's enforcement of the defined constraints (NOT NULL, UNIQUE, PRIMARY KEY).

These migration files provide a solid foundation for managing invitations in the application's database, allowing for easy implementation and removal of the invitations feature as needed.
