## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for creating and dropping an "invitations" table in the database. It consists of two files: `up.sql` for creating the table and `down.sql` for removing it. These scripts are part of a database migration system, likely used to manage database schema changes in a version-controlled manner.

## What does it do?
The scripts in this directory manage the lifecycle of an "invitations" table in the database:

1. The `up.sql` script creates a new table called "invitations" with fields to store information about invitations sent by the system. This table includes columns for:
   - A unique identifier for each invitation
   - The email address of the person invited
   - An expiration date for the invitation
   - Timestamps for when the invitation was created and last updated

2. The `down.sql` script provides a way to undo the changes made by `up.sql`. It drops the "invitations" table, effectively removing it from the database.

These scripts allow developers to easily add or remove the "invitations" feature from the database schema. This is particularly useful in development environments where database changes need to be applied or rolled back frequently, or in production environments where database schema changes need to be managed carefully and reversibly.

## Key Files

### up.sql
This file contains the SQL commands to create the "invitations" table. Here's a breakdown of the table structure:

```sql
CREATE TABLE invitations (
    id UUID NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    expires_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL
);
```

- `id`: A unique identifier for each invitation, using UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) format.
- `email`: The email address of the invitee, limited to 100 characters.
- `expires_at`: The date and time when the invitation expires.
- `created_at`: The timestamp when the invitation was created.
- `updated_at`: The timestamp of the last update to the invitation record.

All fields are marked as `NOT NULL`, ensuring that every invitation record has all these pieces of information.

### down.sql
This file contains a single SQL command to drop the "invitations" table:

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS invitations;
```

The `IF EXISTS` clause makes this operation idempotent, meaning it can be run multiple times without causing errors, even if the table doesn't exist.

## Configuration
The migration scripts don't require any external configuration. However, the naming convention of the directory (2018-10-16-095633_invitations) suggests that this migration was created on October 16, 2018, at 09:56:33. This timestamp-based naming is likely part of the migration system's configuration, allowing migrations to be applied in a specific order.

In conclusion, these migration scripts provide a structured way to add and remove an "invitations" feature from the database schema. They allow for version control of database changes and easy application or rollback of these changes across different environments.
