## High-level description
This SQL script creates a new table named `invitations` in the database. The table is designed to store information about invitations, including a unique identifier, email address, expiration date, and timestamps for creation and last update.

### `invitations` table
#### Description
The `invitations` table is created to store invitation data. It includes fields for managing the lifecycle of an invitation, from creation to expiration.

#### Fields
| Name | Type | Constraints | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|:------------|
| id | UUID | NOT NULL, UNIQUE, PRIMARY KEY | Unique identifier for each invitation |
| email | VARCHAR(100) | NOT NULL | Email address of the invited user |
| expires_at | TIMESTAMP | NOT NULL | Expiration date and time of the invitation |
| created_at | TIMESTAMP | NOT NULL | Date and time when the invitation was created |
| updated_at | TIMESTAMP | NOT NULL | Date and time when the invitation was last updated |

#### Internal Logic
The table structure ensures that:
1. Each invitation has a unique UUID as its identifier.
2. An email address is required for each invitation.
3. All invitations have an expiration date.
4. Creation and last update times are tracked for each invitation.

## Dependencies
This SQL script doesn't explicitly depend on any external libraries or modules. However, it assumes the database system supports:
- UUID data type
- TIMESTAMP data type
- VARCHAR data type with length specification

## Configuration
The script doesn't include any configurable options. The table structure is fixed as defined in the CREATE TABLE statement.

## Error Handling
The script doesn't include explicit error handling. However, the database system will enforce the defined constraints:
- NOT NULL constraints ensure that all fields must have a value.
- UNIQUE constraint on the `id` field prevents duplicate UUIDs.
- PRIMARY KEY constraint on the `id` field ensures each row can be uniquely identified.

## Notes
1. This script is part of a database migration, as indicated by its file path (server/migrations/).
2. The migration is timestamped (2018-10-16-095633), which helps in ordering and tracking database changes.
3. This is an "up" migration script, typically used to apply changes to the database schema.
4. The script doesn't include any indexes beyond the primary key. Depending on query patterns, additional indexes (e.g., on the `email` or `expires_at` columns) might be beneficial for performance.
5. The `email` field is limited to 100 characters, which should be sufficient for most email addresses but could potentially cause issues with extremely long addresses.
6. There are no foreign key constraints, suggesting this table doesn't directly relate to other tables in the database schema.
