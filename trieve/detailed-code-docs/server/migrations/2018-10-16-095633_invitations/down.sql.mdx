## High-level description
This SQL script handles the database migration rollback for removing the "invitations" table. It's intended to be idempotent, meaning it can be safely executed multiple times without causing issues.

## Symbols

### `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS invitations;`
#### Description
This SQL statement attempts to drop the "invitations" table if it exists in the database. 

#### Internal Logic
- **`DROP TABLE`**: This is a SQL command to remove a table from the database.
- **`IF EXISTS`**: This clause makes the operation conditional. The table will only be dropped if it already exists. This prevents errors if the table doesn't exist, making the script idempotent.
- **`invitations`**: This is the name of the table to be dropped.

#### Side Effects
- If the "invitations" table exists, it will be permanently deleted along with all its data.
