## High-level description
This SQL migration file is designed to undo the changes made by the corresponding `up.sql` file. It drops the `invitations` table if it exists in the database.

## Symbols

### `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS invitations;`
#### Description
This SQL command is used to remove the `invitations` table from the database schema if it exists.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `IF EXISTS` clause is used to prevent errors if the table doesn't exist.
2. If the `invitations` table exists, it will be completely removed from the database, including all its data and structure.

## Side Effects
- If the `invitations` table exists, it will be permanently deleted from the database, along with all its contents.
- If the table doesn't exist, this command will have no effect on the database.

## Dependencies
This migration file likely depends on a database management system that supports SQL, such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQLite.

## Error Handling
The `IF EXISTS` clause provides a basic form of error handling by preventing the command from failing if the table doesn't exist.

## TODOs
The comment at the top of the file, `-- This file should undo anything in `up.sql``, serves as a reminder and guideline for the purpose of this migration file. It suggests that there might be an accompanying `up.sql` file that created the `invitations` table, and this `down.sql` file is intended to revert those changes.
