## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for a database schema update. The migration is dated 2023-12-12 and is labeled as "drop_unneeded", indicating its purpose is to remove unnecessary database objects. The directory includes two SQL files: `up.sql` for applying the changes and `down.sql` for reverting them.

## What does it do?
This migration performs a cleanup of the database schema by removing several objects that are no longer needed:

1. It drops a column named `card_metadata_tsvector` from the `card_metadata` table. This column was likely used for full-text search functionality.
2. It removes two entire tables: `invitations` and `password_resets`. These tables were probably used for managing user invitations and password reset requests, respectively.
3. It drops a trigger named `update_tsvector_trigger` on the `card_metadata` table, which was likely responsible for automatically updating the full-text search index.
4. Finally, it removes a function called `update_tsvector()`, which was probably used by the dropped trigger.

The `down.sql` script provides a way to revert these changes by recreating the dropped objects. This ensures that the migration can be rolled back if needed.

## Key Files

1. `up.sql`:
   This file contains the SQL statements to apply the migration. It drops the `card_metadata_tsvector` column, the `invitations` and `password_resets` tables, the `update_tsvector_trigger`, and the `update_tsvector()` function. Each statement uses the `IF EXISTS` clause to prevent errors if the objects don't exist.

   Example:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE card_metadata DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS card_metadata_tsvector;
   DROP TABLE IF EXISTS invitations;
   DROP TABLE IF EXISTS password_resets;
   DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS update_tsvector_trigger ON card_metadata;
   DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS update_tsvector();
   ```

2. `down.sql`:
   This file contains the SQL statements to revert the migration. It recreates the `invitations` and `password_resets` tables, adds the `card_metadata_tsvector` column back to the `card_metadata` table, and recreates the `update_tsvector()` function and the associated trigger.

   Example of recreating a table:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE invitations (
       id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
       email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
       expires_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
       created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
       updated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL
   );
   ```

   Example of recreating the full-text search functionality:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE card_metadata ADD COLUMN card_metadata_tsvector tsvector;

   CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_tsvector() RETURNS trigger AS $$
   BEGIN
     NEW.card_metadata_tsvector := to_tsvector('english', NEW.content);
     RETURN NEW;
   END
   $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

   CREATE TRIGGER update_tsvector_trigger BEFORE INSERT ON card_metadata
   FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION update_tsvector();
   ```

These migration scripts demonstrate a significant change in the database schema, likely reflecting a shift in the application's architecture or features. The removal of the `invitations` and `password_resets` tables suggests that the application might be changing how it handles user registration and password management. The removal of the full-text search functionality from the `card_metadata` table indicates that this feature is either being removed or implemented differently.

The use of reversible migrations (with `up.sql` and `down.sql`) is a good practice, allowing for easy rollback of changes if issues are discovered after deployment.
