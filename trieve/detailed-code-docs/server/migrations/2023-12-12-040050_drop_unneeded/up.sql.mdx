## High-level description
This SQL script defines an "up" migration that drops several database objects, including a column, tables, a trigger, and a function. This suggests that these objects are no longer needed in the application's data model.

## Symbols
### `ALTER TABLE card_metadata DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS card_metadata_tsvector`
#### Description
This statement attempts to drop a column named `card_metadata_tsvector` from the `card_metadata` table. The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the operation doesn't fail if the column doesn't exist.

#### Internal Logic
- Checks if the column `card_metadata_tsvector` exists in the `card_metadata` table.
- If the column exists, it is dropped from the table.
- If the column doesn't exist, the statement completes without error.

### `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS invitations`
#### Description
This statement attempts to drop a table named `invitations`. The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the operation doesn't fail if the table doesn't exist.

#### Internal Logic
- Checks if the table `invitations` exists in the database.
- If the table exists, it is dropped from the database.
- If the table doesn't exist, the statement completes without error.

### `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS password_resets`
#### Description
This statement attempts to drop a table named `password_resets`. The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the operation doesn't fail if the table doesn't exist.

#### Internal Logic
- Checks if the table `password_resets` exists in the database.
- If the table exists, it is dropped from the database.
- If the table doesn't exist, the statement completes without error.

### `DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS update_tsvector_trigger ON card_metadata`
#### Description
This statement attempts to drop a trigger named `update_tsvector_trigger` on the `card_metadata` table. The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the operation doesn't fail if the trigger doesn't exist.

#### Internal Logic
- Checks if the trigger `update_tsvector_trigger` exists on the `card_metadata` table.
- If the trigger exists, it is dropped.
- If the trigger doesn't exist, the statement completes without error.

### `DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS update_tsvector()`
#### Description
This statement attempts to drop a function named `update_tsvector()`. The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the operation doesn't fail if the function doesn't exist.

#### Internal Logic
- Checks if the function `update_tsvector()` exists in the database.
- If the function exists, it is dropped.
- If the function doesn't exist, the statement completes without error.
