## High-level description
This SQL script reverts the database changes made by the migration `2024-07-11-222705_use-builtin-updated-created-at`. It removes triggers and functions related to automatically updating the `updated_at` column and replaces them with a custom implementation.

## Code Structure
The code first drops triggers and functions created by a previous migration. Then it defines two new functions: `update_updated_at` and `update_main_table_updated_at`. Finally, it creates triggers on various tables that call these functions to update the `updated_at` column on row updates.

## Symbols

### `DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS set_updated_at ON ...`
#### Description
These statements attempt to drop triggers named `set_updated_at` on multiple tables if they exist. This is to clean up triggers created by a previous migration.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the statement doesn't fail if the trigger doesn't exist.

### `DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS diesel_manage_updated_at(regclass);`
#### Description
This statement attempts to drop the function `diesel_manage_updated_at` if it exists. This function was likely created by a previous migration.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the statement doesn't fail if the function doesn't exist.

### `DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS diesel_set_updated_at();`
#### Description
This statement attempts to drop the function `diesel_set_updated_at` if it exists. This function was likely created by a previous migration.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the statement doesn't fail if the function doesn't exist.

### `CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_updated_at() ...`
#### Description
This statement defines or replaces a function named `update_updated_at`. This function is a trigger function that updates the `updated_at` column of a row to the current timestamp.

#### Inputs
None (receives the row being updated as `NEW`)

#### Outputs
Returns the updated row (`NEW`)

#### Internal Logic
- Sets the `updated_at` column of the `NEW` row to `current_timestamp`.
- Returns the modified `NEW` row.

### `CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_main_table_updated_at() ...`
#### Description
This statement defines or replaces a function named `update_main_table_updated_at`. This function is a trigger function that updates the `updated_at` column of a "main" table based on the `collection_id` of the row being updated in a related table.

#### Inputs
None (receives the row being updated as `NEW`)

#### Outputs
Returns the updated row (`NEW`)

#### Internal Logic
- Updates the `updated_at` column of the "main" table to `current_timestamp` where the `id` matches the `collection_id` of the `NEW` row.
- Returns the modified `NEW` row.

### `CREATE TRIGGER update_updated_at ...` (all instances)
#### Description
These statements create triggers named `update_updated_at` on various tables. Each trigger is set to fire before an `UPDATE` operation on the respective table.

#### Inputs
None (triggered by `UPDATE` operations on the table)

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
- For `chunk_group`, `chunk_metadata`, `files`, `groups_from_files`, `messages`, `topics`, and `users` tables:
    - Executes the `update_updated_at()` function for each row being updated.
- For the `chunk_group_bookmarks` table:
    - Executes the `update_main_table_updated_at()` function for each row being updated.
