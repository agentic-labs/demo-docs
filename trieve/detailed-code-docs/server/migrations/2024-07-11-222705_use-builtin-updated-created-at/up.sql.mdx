## High-level description
This SQL script migrates the database to use built-in `updated_at` and `created_at` timestamps by replacing custom triggers and functions with a new mechanism using PostgreSQL's built-in functions. It first drops existing triggers and functions related to updating `updated_at` timestamps and then creates new functions and triggers to manage these timestamps automatically.

## Code Structure
The code first defines a function `diesel_manage_updated_at` which is responsible for creating triggers on specified tables. This function is then called for each table requiring the `updated_at` functionality. The `diesel_set_updated_at` function is the actual trigger function that updates the `updated_at` column.

## Symbols

### `diesel_manage_updated_at`
#### Description
This function creates a trigger named `set_updated_at` on the provided table. This trigger executes the `diesel_set_updated_at` function before any `UPDATE` operation on the table.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| _tbl | regclass | The name of the table to create the trigger on. |

#### Outputs
This function does not return any values.

#### Internal Logic
1. Constructs a SQL statement to create a trigger named `set_updated_at` on the provided table.
2. The trigger is set to execute the `diesel_set_updated_at` function before any `UPDATE` operation on the table.
3. Executes the constructed SQL statement.

### `diesel_set_updated_at`
#### Description
This function serves as the trigger function for the `set_updated_at` trigger. It updates the `updated_at` column of a row to the current timestamp before an `UPDATE` operation, but only if the row's content has changed and the `updated_at` column wasn't explicitly set in the update statement.

#### Inputs
This function implicitly takes the `NEW` and `OLD` records as input, representing the row values before and after the update operation, respectively.

#### Outputs
This function returns the `NEW` record, potentially modified with an updated `updated_at` value.

#### Internal Logic
1. Compares the `NEW` and `OLD` records. If they are identical or the `updated_at` column is explicitly updated in the `UPDATE` statement, no action is taken.
2. If the row's content has changed and the `updated_at` column wasn't explicitly set in the update statement, it updates the `NEW.updated_at` value to the current timestamp.
3. Returns the potentially modified `NEW` record.
