## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for implementing and reverting changes related to the use of built-in `updated_at` and `created_at` timestamps in a PostgreSQL database. The migration is identified by the timestamp 2024-07-11-222705 and is titled "use-builtin-updated-created-at".

## What does it do?
The migration scripts in this directory perform the following tasks:

1. Up migration (up.sql):
   - Removes existing custom triggers and functions for managing `updated_at` timestamps.
   - Implements a new, more efficient mechanism using PostgreSQL's built-in functions to automatically update `updated_at` timestamps.
   - Creates a generic function `diesel_manage_updated_at` to set up triggers on specified tables.
   - Applies the new timestamp management system to multiple tables in the database.

2. Down migration (down.sql):
   - Reverts the changes made by the up migration.
   - Removes the built-in timestamp management system.
   - Reintroduces custom triggers and functions for managing `updated_at` timestamps.
   - Implements a separate function for updating the main table's `updated_at` column based on changes in related tables.

## Key Files

### up.sql
This file contains the SQL commands for implementing the new timestamp management system. Key components include:

1. `diesel_manage_updated_at` function:
   ```sql
   CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION diesel_manage_updated_at(_tbl regclass) RETURNS VOID AS $$
   BEGIN
       EXECUTE format('CREATE TRIGGER set_updated_at BEFORE UPDATE ON %s
           FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE PROCEDURE diesel_set_updated_at()', _tbl);
   END;
   $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
   ```
   This function creates a trigger on the specified table to automatically update the `updated_at` column.

2. `diesel_set_updated_at` function:
   ```sql
   CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION diesel_set_updated_at() RETURNS trigger AS $$
   BEGIN
       IF (
           NEW IS DISTINCT FROM OLD AND
           NEW.updated_at IS NOT DISTINCT FROM OLD.updated_at
       ) THEN
           NEW.updated_at := current_timestamp;
       END IF;
       RETURN NEW;
   END;
   $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
   ```
   This function is the actual trigger function that updates the `updated_at` column when a row is modified.

3. Application of the new system to multiple tables:
   ```sql
   SELECT diesel_manage_updated_at('chunk_group');
   SELECT diesel_manage_updated_at('chunk_metadata');
   -- ... (more tables)
   ```

### down.sql
This file contains the SQL commands for reverting the changes made by up.sql. Key components include:

1. Removal of triggers and functions created by the up migration:
   ```sql
   DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS set_updated_at ON chunk_group;
   DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS set_updated_at ON chunk_metadata;
   -- ... (more tables)
   DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS diesel_manage_updated_at(regclass);
   DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS diesel_set_updated_at();
   ```

2. Creation of custom functions for managing `updated_at`:
   ```sql
   CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_updated_at() RETURNS trigger AS $$
   BEGIN
       NEW.updated_at = current_timestamp;
       RETURN NEW;
   END;
   $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
   ```

3. Creation of triggers using the custom functions:
   ```sql
   CREATE TRIGGER update_updated_at BEFORE UPDATE ON chunk_group
       FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE PROCEDURE update_updated_at();
   CREATE TRIGGER update_updated_at BEFORE UPDATE ON chunk_metadata
       FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE PROCEDURE update_updated_at();
   -- ... (more tables)
   ```

## Configuration
This migration does not rely on any external configuration files or environment variables. The changes are applied directly to the database schema through SQL commands.

The migration affects the following tables:
- chunk_group
- chunk_metadata
- files
- groups_from_files
- messages
- topics
- users
- chunk_group_bookmarks

Developers should ensure that these tables exist in the database before applying the migration.

## Dependencies
This migration relies on PostgreSQL-specific features and functions. It is designed to work with PostgreSQL databases and may not be compatible with other database management systems. The exact version of PostgreSQL is not specified in the provided code, but it should be compatible with recent versions of PostgreSQL that support the used features (e.g., `CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION`, `EXECUTE format(...)`, etc.).

The migration scripts use the following PostgreSQL-specific elements:
- PL/pgSQL language for stored procedures
- `regclass` type for table names
- `EXECUTE format(...)` for dynamic SQL execution
- PostgreSQL's trigger system

Developers should ensure that the target PostgreSQL database supports these features before applying the migration.
