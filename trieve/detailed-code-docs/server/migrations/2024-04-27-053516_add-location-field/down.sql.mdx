## High-level description
This SQL script is a database migration file that reverts a schema change made by `up.sql`. Specifically, it removes the `location` column from the `chunk_metadata` table.

## Symbols

### `ALTER TABLE chunk_metadata DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS location;`
#### Description
This SQL statement removes the `location` column from the `chunk_metadata` table if it exists. The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the statement executes successfully even if the column has already been removed.

#### Internal Logic
1. **`ALTER TABLE chunk_metadata`**: This clause specifies that the following operation should be performed on the table named `chunk_metadata`.
2. **`DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS location`**: This clause instructs the database to drop (remove) the column named `location` from the table. The `IF EXISTS` clause prevents an error if the column does not exist.

#### Side Effects
- The `location` column will be removed from the `chunk_metadata` table.
- Any data stored in the `location` column will be permanently deleted.
