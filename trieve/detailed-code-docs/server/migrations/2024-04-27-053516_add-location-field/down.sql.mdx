## High-level description
This SQL script defines a database migration that reverts the changes introduced by the corresponding `up.sql` migration. Specifically, it removes the `location` column from the `chunk_metadata` table.

## Symbols

### `ALTER TABLE chunk_metadata DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS location;`
#### Description
This SQL statement removes the `location` column from the `chunk_metadata` table if it exists. The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the statement executes successfully even if the column has already been removed.

#### Internal Logic
1. **`ALTER TABLE chunk_metadata`**: This part of the statement specifies that the `chunk_metadata` table is being modified.
2. **`DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS location`**: This part instructs the database to drop (remove) the column named `location` if it exists in the table. 
    - `DROP COLUMN` is the SQL command for removing a column.
    - `IF EXISTS` is a conditional clause that checks for the existence of the column before attempting to drop it. This prevents errors if the column doesn't exist.
    - `location` is the name of the column to be dropped.

#### Side Effects
- **Modifies database schema**: This statement directly modifies the structure of the `chunk_metadata` table by removing the `location` column. Any data previously stored in this column will be permanently deleted.
