## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for adding a new `location` field to the `chunk_metadata` table in the database. The migration is dated 2024-04-27 and consists of two files: `up.sql` for applying the change and `down.sql` for reverting it.

## What does it do?
These migration scripts modify the database structure to include a new `location` column in the `chunk_metadata` table. This column is designed to store geographical or positional information related to chunks of data.

The `up.sql` script adds the new column:
- It creates a `location` column of type JSONB (JSON Binary) in the `chunk_metadata` table.
- The column is set to allow null values and has a default value of an empty JSON object (`{}`).

The `down.sql` script provides a way to undo this change:
- It removes the `location` column from the `chunk_metadata` table if it exists.

These scripts allow for easy application and rollback of the database schema change, which is crucial for maintaining database consistency across different environments and versions of the application.

## Key Files

1. `up.sql`:
   - Purpose: Applies the database schema change.
   - Content: Adds the `location` column to the `chunk_metadata` table.
   - SQL: `ALTER TABLE chunk_metadata ADD COLUMN location JSONB DEFAULT '{}' NULL;`

2. `down.sql`:
   - Purpose: Reverts the database schema change.
   - Content: Removes the `location` column from the `chunk_metadata` table.
   - SQL: `ALTER TABLE chunk_metadata DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS location;`

## Configuration
The migration scripts don't require any external configuration. However, the database connection details and migration framework configuration should be set up in the main application to execute these scripts properly.

Additional notes:
- The use of JSONB type for the `location` column suggests that the application expects to store complex location data, possibly including coordinates, address information, or other geographical metadata.
- The default value of `{}` ensures that existing rows and new insertions without a specified location will have a valid JSON object to work with.
- The `NULL` constraint allows the column to be optional, giving flexibility in data storage.
- The `IF EXISTS` clause in the `down.sql` script ensures that the rollback operation is idempotent, meaning it can be run multiple times without causing errors.

These migration scripts demonstrate good database management practices by providing both forward and backward compatibility, allowing for smooth updates and rollbacks of the application's data model.
