## High-level description
This SQL script reverts a database migration that modified triggers related to chunk metadata counts. It drops the existing triggers and function, then recreates a function and trigger to update chunk counts in the `dataset_usage_counts` table based on insertions and deletions in the `chunk_metadata` table. This effectively reverts to a row-level trigger approach for maintaining chunk counts.

## Symbols

### `DROP TRIGGER increase_chunk_metadata_counts_trigger ON chunk_metadata;`
#### Description
This statement drops the trigger named `increase_chunk_metadata_counts_trigger` associated with the `chunk_metadata` table. This trigger was likely responsible for incrementing chunk counts in the `dataset_usage_counts` table.

### `DROP TRIGGER delete_chunk_metadata_counts_trigger ON chunk_metadata;`
#### Description
Similar to the previous statement, this drops the `delete_chunk_metadata_counts_trigger` from the `chunk_metadata` table. This trigger was likely responsible for decrementing chunk counts.

### `DROP FUNCTION update_chunk_metadata_counts;`
#### Description
This statement drops the function named `update_chunk_metadata_counts`. This function was likely used by the triggers to update the chunk counts in `dataset_usage_counts`.

### `CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_chunk_metadata_counts()`
#### Description
This statement defines or replaces a function named `update_chunk_metadata_counts`. This function is designed to be used as a trigger function for the `chunk_metadata` table. It updates the `chunk_count` in the `dataset_usage_counts` table based on insert or delete operations on the `chunk_metadata` table.

#### Inputs
This function implicitly takes the inserted or deleted row from the `chunk_metadata` table as input through the `NEW` and `OLD` records within the trigger context.

#### Outputs
This function returns `NULL` as it is primarily performing side effects on the database.

#### Internal Logic
- It checks the type of operation (`TG_OP`) to determine if it's an insert or delete.
- **If it's an insert:**
    - It attempts to insert a new row into `dataset_usage_counts` with a `chunk_count` of 1.
    - If a row with the same `dataset_id` already exists, it increments the existing `chunk_count` by 1.
- **If it's a delete:**
    - It decrements the `chunk_count` in `dataset_usage_counts` for the corresponding `dataset_id`.
    - It ensures that the `chunk_count` doesn't go below 0.

### `CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER update_chunk_metadata_counts_trigger`
#### Description
This statement defines or replaces a trigger named `update_chunk_metadata_counts_trigger` on the `chunk_metadata` table. This trigger is set to fire `AFTER` each `INSERT` or `DELETE` operation on the table for each affected row.

#### Internal Logic
The trigger executes the `update_chunk_metadata_counts` function after each insert or delete operation on the `chunk_metadata` table. This ensures that the `chunk_count` in the `dataset_usage_counts` table is kept consistent.
