## High-level description
This SQL script modifies the database schema by replacing the existing trigger and function responsible for updating chunk metadata counts. The new trigger operates at the statement level, improving performance by reducing the number of updates to the `dataset_usage_counts` table.

## Code Structure
The code first drops the existing trigger and function (`update_chunk_metadata_counts_trigger` and `update_chunk_metadata_counts`). It then defines a new function (`update_chunk_metadata_counts`) and two new triggers (`increase_chunk_metadata_counts_trigger` and `delete_chunk_metadata_counts_trigger`) that utilize this function.

## Symbols

### `update_chunk_metadata_counts`
#### Description
This function updates the `chunk_count` in the `dataset_usage_counts` table based on insertions or deletions in the `chunk_metadata` table. It calculates the total count of affected rows and updates the `dataset_usage_counts` table accordingly.

#### Inputs
This function has no explicit inputs. It uses the `NEW` and `OLD` tables within the trigger context to access inserted or deleted rows.

#### Outputs
This function returns `NULL`. Its primary output is the side effect of updating the `dataset_usage_counts` table.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Determine affected dataset:** Retrieves the `dataset_id` from the `modified` table (which represents either `NEW` or `OLD` data depending on the triggering action).
2. **Calculate count change:** Counts the number of rows in the `modified` table, representing the change in chunk count.
3. **Update `dataset_usage_counts`:**
    - **For INSERT:** Inserts a new row into `dataset_usage_counts` with the `dataset_id` and the calculated `new_count`. If a row already exists for the `dataset_id`, it updates the existing `chunk_count` by adding the `new_count`.
    - **For DELETE:** Updates the existing row in `dataset_usage_counts` for the given `dataset_id` by subtracting the `new_count` from the current `chunk_count`.

### `increase_chunk_metadata_counts_trigger`
#### Description
This trigger is executed after an INSERT operation on the `chunk_metadata` table. It utilizes the `update_chunk_metadata_counts` function to update the `chunk_count` in the `dataset_usage_counts` table.

#### Inputs
This trigger implicitly receives the inserted rows in the `chunk_metadata` table through the `NEW` table reference.

#### Outputs
This trigger has no direct outputs. Its action is the execution of the `update_chunk_metadata_counts` function.

### `delete_chunk_metadata_counts_trigger`
#### Description
This trigger is executed after a DELETE operation on the `chunk_metadata` table. It uses the `update_chunk_metadata_counts` function to update the `chunk_count` in the `dataset_usage_counts` table.

#### Inputs
This trigger implicitly receives the deleted rows in the `chunk_metadata` table through the `OLD` table reference.

#### Outputs
This trigger has no direct outputs. Its action is the execution of the `update_chunk_metadata_counts` function.

## Side Effects
- Modifies the `dataset_usage_counts` table by updating the `chunk_count` based on insertions or deletions in the `chunk_metadata` table.

## Performance Considerations
The use of statement-level triggers (`FOR EACH STATEMENT`) instead of row-level triggers (`FOR EACH ROW`) significantly improves performance. This is because the `update_chunk_metadata_counts` function is called only once per statement, even if multiple rows are inserted or deleted, reducing the overhead of multiple database updates.
