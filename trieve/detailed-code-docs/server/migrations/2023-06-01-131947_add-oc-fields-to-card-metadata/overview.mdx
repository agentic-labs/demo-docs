## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration files for adding a new column `oc_file_path` to the `card_metadata` table in the database. The migration is dated 2023-06-01 and is specifically designed to add OpenCollective (OC) related fields to the card metadata.

## What does it do?
The migration performs the following actions:

1. In the "up" migration:
   - It adds a new column called `oc_file_path` to the `card_metadata` table.
   - This new column is of type TEXT and allows NULL values.
   - It's designed to store file path information related to OpenCollective data for card metadata.

2. In the "down" migration:
   - It removes the `oc_file_path` column from the `card_metadata` table.
   - This effectively undoes the changes made by the "up" migration.

These migrations allow the database schema to be updated to include new OpenCollective-related information, and also provide a way to revert these changes if needed.

## Key Files

1. `up.sql`:
   - This file contains the SQL commands to add the new `oc_file_path` column to the `card_metadata` table.
   - It uses the `ALTER TABLE` command to modify the existing table structure.
   - The new column is defined as TEXT and allows NULL values, making it optional.

2. `down.sql`:
   - This file contains the SQL commands to remove the `oc_file_path` column from the `card_metadata` table.
   - It also uses the `ALTER TABLE` command, but with the `DROP COLUMN` clause to remove the previously added column.

## Dependencies
These migration files depend on:

1. The existence of a `card_metadata` table in the database.
2. A database system that supports standard SQL ALTER TABLE commands.

No external libraries or frameworks are directly used in these SQL scripts.

## Configuration
These migration files do not require any specific configuration. They are designed to be run as part of a database migration process, typically managed by an ORM or migration tool in the main application.

## Performance Considerations
While these migrations are relatively simple, there are some performance aspects to consider:

1. For the "up" migration:
   - Adding a new column to an existing table is generally a quick operation.
   - However, if the `card_metadata` table has a large number of rows, this operation might take some time to complete.
   - The impact is minimized because the new column allows NULL values and doesn't require data conversion for existing rows.

2. For the "down" migration:
   - Dropping a column is usually a quick operation.
   - However, it may briefly lock the table, which could impact concurrent operations if the table is heavily used.
   - Any data stored in the `oc_file_path` column will be permanently deleted.

It's recommended to perform these migrations during low-traffic periods to minimize potential disruptions to the application's performance.

## Error Handling
These SQL scripts do not include explicit error handling. If the `card_metadata` table doesn't exist or if the `oc_file_path` column is missing (in the case of the down migration), the database system will likely raise an error. It's important for the migration runner to handle these potential errors appropriately.

In conclusion, this migration set provides a straightforward way to add and remove an OpenCollective-related field to the card metadata, allowing for flexible schema updates as the application's data requirements evolve.
