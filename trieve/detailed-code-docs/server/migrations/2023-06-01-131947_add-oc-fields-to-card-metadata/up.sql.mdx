## High-level description
This SQL migration script adds a new column named `oc_file_path` to the `card_metadata` table. The column is designed to store file path information related to OpenCollective (OC) data for card metadata.

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE card_metadata
#### Description
This SQL command modifies the structure of the existing `card_metadata` table by adding a new column.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `ALTER TABLE` statement is used to modify the `card_metadata` table.
2. The `ADD COLUMN` clause specifies that a new column is being added to the table.
3. The new column is named `oc_file_path`.
4. The data type of the new column is set to `TEXT`, allowing it to store string data of variable length.
5. The `NULL` keyword indicates that this column can contain null values, making it optional.

## Side Effects
- This migration will modify the structure of the `card_metadata` table in the database.
- Existing rows in the `card_metadata` table will have a null value for the new `oc_file_path` column.
- Any applications or queries that interact with the `card_metadata` table will now have access to this new column.

## Performance Considerations
- Adding a new column to an existing table with a large number of rows might take some time to complete, depending on the database size and system resources.
- The operation does not require data conversion or manipulation of existing rows, which helps minimize the performance impact.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs or notes left in the code.
