title: "down.sql"

## High-level description
This SQL migration file is designed to undo the changes made in the corresponding `up.sql` file. It removes the `oc_file_path` column from the `card_metadata` table in the database.

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE card_metadata
#### Description
This SQL command modifies the structure of the `card_metadata` table by removing a specific column.

#### Internal Logic
The command drops (removes) the `oc_file_path` column from the `card_metadata` table. This operation effectively reverses the addition of this column, which was likely performed in the corresponding `up.sql` migration.

## Side Effects
- The `card_metadata` table structure is modified.
- Any data that was stored in the `oc_file_path` column will be permanently deleted.

## Dependencies
This SQL script relies on the existence of:
1. The `card_metadata` table in the database.
2. The `oc_file_path` column in the `card_metadata` table.

## Error Handling
No explicit error handling is implemented in this script. If the `card_metadata` table or the `oc_file_path` column doesn't exist, the database management system will likely raise an error.

## Performance Considerations
Dropping a column is generally a quick operation, but it may lock the table briefly. The impact on performance depends on the size of the table and the current database load.
