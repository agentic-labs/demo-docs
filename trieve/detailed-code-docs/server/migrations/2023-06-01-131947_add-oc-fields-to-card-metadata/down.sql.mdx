title: "down.sql"
---

## High-level description
This SQL migration file is designed to undo the changes made in the corresponding `up.sql` file. It removes the `oc_file_path` column from the `card_metadata` table in the database.

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE card_metadata
#### Description
This SQL command modifies the structure of the `card_metadata` table by removing a specific column.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `ALTER TABLE` statement is used to modify the existing `card_metadata` table.
2. The `DROP COLUMN` clause is used to remove the `oc_file_path` column from the table.

## Side Effects
- The `oc_file_path` column will be permanently removed from the `card_metadata` table.
- Any data stored in the `oc_file_path` column will be lost after executing this migration.

## Dependencies
This migration file depends on the existence of:
1. The `card_metadata` table in the database.
2. The `oc_file_path` column in the `card_metadata` table.

## Error Handling
No explicit error handling is implemented in this SQL script. If the `card_metadata` table or the `oc_file_path` column doesn't exist, the database management system will likely raise an error when attempting to execute this migration.

## Notes
1. This is a database migration file, specifically a "down" migration, which is used to revert changes made by a corresponding "up" migration.
2. The comment at the top of the file indicates that this script should undo anything done in the `up.sql` file.
3. It's important to ensure that this down migration accurately reverses all changes made in the corresponding up migration to maintain database consistency when rolling back changes.
4. The filename suggests that this migration was created on June 1, 2023, and it's related to adding OC (possibly "Original Content") fields to the card metadata.
