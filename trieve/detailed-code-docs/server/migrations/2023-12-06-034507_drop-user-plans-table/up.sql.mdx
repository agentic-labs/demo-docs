## High-level description
This SQL migration script is designed to remove the `user_plans` table and its associated index from the database. It's a part of a database schema change, likely to restructure or remove user plan-related data.

## Symbols

### DROP TABLE IF EXISTS user_plans;
#### Description
This SQL command removes the `user_plans` table from the database if it exists.

#### Internal Logic
- The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the command will not throw an error if the table doesn't exist.
- If the table exists, it will be completely removed from the database schema, including all its data and structure.

### DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_user_plans_stripe_customer_id;
#### Description
This SQL command removes an index named `idx_user_plans_stripe_customer_id` if it exists.

#### Internal Logic
- The `IF EXISTS` clause prevents errors if the index doesn't exist.
- If the index exists, it will be removed from the database.
- The index name suggests it was created on the `stripe_customer_id` column of the `user_plans` table.

## Side Effects
- Permanent removal of the `user_plans` table and all its data.
- Removal of the `idx_user_plans_stripe_customer_id` index, which may impact query performance for operations that previously used this index.
- Potential impact on application code that relies on the `user_plans` table or its index.

## Performance Considerations
- Dropping a table and index are generally fast operations, but the time may vary depending on the size of the table and the current database load.
- After this migration, queries that previously used the `user_plans` table or the dropped index may need to be adjusted or may perform differently.

## Error Handling
The script uses `IF EXISTS` clauses to prevent errors if the table or index doesn't exist, making the migration more robust and idempotent.
