## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for dropping the `user_plans` table and its associated index from the database schema. It consists of two files: `up.sql` for applying the changes and `down.sql` for reverting them. These migrations are part of a database schema update, likely reflecting changes in how user subscription plans are managed within the application.

## What does it do?
The migration scripts in this directory perform the following actions:

1. The `up.sql` script:
   - Removes the `user_plans` table from the database if it exists.
   - Removes the index `idx_user_plans_stripe_customer_id` if it exists.

2. The `down.sql` script:
   - Recreates the `user_plans` table with its original structure and constraints.
   - Recreates the index `idx_user_plans_stripe_customer_id` on the `stripe_customer_id` column.

These scripts allow the application to transition between two different states of the database schema: one where user plans are stored in a dedicated table, and another where this information is likely managed differently (perhaps integrated into another table or handled through a different mechanism).

## Key Files

### up.sql
This file contains the SQL commands to apply the migration:

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS user_plans;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_user_plans_stripe_customer_id;
```

These commands remove the `user_plans` table and its associated index, effectively eliminating this part of the schema from the database.

### down.sql
This file contains the SQL commands to revert the migration:

```sql
CREATE TABLE user_plans (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    stripe_customer_id TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    stripe_subscription_id TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    plan TEXT NOT NULL,
    status TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL
);

CREATE INDEX idx_user_plans_stripe_customer_id ON user_plans (stripe_customer_id);
```

These commands recreate the `user_plans` table with its original structure and constraints, as well as the index on the `stripe_customer_id` column.

## Configuration
The migration scripts do not rely on any external configuration files or environment variables. However, they are likely part of a larger migration system that manages the order and application of these scripts. The filename `2023-12-06-034507_drop-user-plans-table` suggests that this migration was created on December 6, 2023, at 03:45:07, which may be used by the migration system to determine the order of execution.

## Dependencies
While not explicitly stated in the provided scripts, it's important to note that these migrations interact with a database system. The SQL syntax used is compatible with PostgreSQL, which is likely the database system being used. The exact version of PostgreSQL is not specified in these scripts, but it should be at least version 9.5 or later to support the `IF EXISTS` clause in the `DROP` statements.

Additionally, the use of UUIDs for the `id` column suggests that the `uuid-ossp` extension might be enabled in the PostgreSQL database to generate UUIDs, although this is not explicitly shown in these migration scripts.

The scripts also reference Stripe integration through the `stripe_customer_id` and `stripe_subscription_id` columns, indicating that the application likely uses Stripe for payment processing and subscription management.

In conclusion, these migration scripts represent a significant change in the application's data model, specifically in how user subscription plans are managed. The removal of the `user_plans` table suggests that this information might be stored differently or that the subscription model has changed in the application. When applying these migrations, developers should ensure that any application code relying on the `user_plans` table is updated accordingly to prevent errors and maintain functionality.
