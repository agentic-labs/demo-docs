title: "down.sql"

## High-level description
This SQL script is designed to revert the changes made in the corresponding `up.sql` migration. It recreates the `user_plans` table and adds an index on the `stripe_customer_id` column. This migration is part of a database schema management system, likely using a tool like diesel or some other ORM for Rust.

## Symbols

### CREATE TABLE user_plans
#### Description
This SQL command creates a new table named `user_plans` to store information about user subscription plans.

#### Internal Logic
The table is created with the following columns:
- `id`: A UUID serving as the primary key
- `stripe_customer_id`: A unique text field for Stripe customer identification
- `stripe_subscription_id`: A unique text field for Stripe subscription identification
- `plan`: A text field to store the plan type
- `status`: A text field to store the subscription status
- `created_at`: A timestamp for when the record was created
- `updated_at`: A timestamp for when the record was last updated

All fields are set as NOT NULL, ensuring that every record has all required information.

### CREATE INDEX idx_user_plans_stripe_customer_id
#### Description
This SQL command creates an index on the `stripe_customer_id` column of the `user_plans` table.

#### Internal Logic
The index is created to improve query performance when searching or filtering by `stripe_customer_id`. This is particularly useful for operations that frequently look up user plans based on the Stripe customer ID.

## Performance Considerations
The creation of an index on `stripe_customer_id` suggests that this column is frequently used in queries. While this will improve read performance for queries using this column, it may slightly impact write performance as the index needs to be updated with each insert or update operation.

## Dependencies
This migration script likely depends on a database migration tool, possibly diesel for Rust applications, to manage and apply these changes to the database schema.

## Error Handling
The script does not include explicit error handling. It relies on the database system to enforce constraints and report any errors during execution. For example, if the table already exists when trying to create it, the database would typically raise an error.

## TODOs
The comment "-- Your SQL goes here" suggests that this might be a template or placeholder for migration scripts. In a finalized version, this comment should be removed or replaced with more specific documentation about the purpose of this migration.
