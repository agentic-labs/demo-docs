## High-level description
This SQL script defines a function and a trigger to automatically create a default record in the `dataset_usage_counts` table whenever a new dataset is added to the `datasets` table. This ensures that every dataset has a corresponding entry in the usage counts table, even if the initial usage count is zero.

## Code Structure
The code defines two SQL objects: a function named `set_default_dataset_usage_data` and a trigger named `set_default_dataset_usage_data_trigger`. The trigger is set to execute the function after each new row insertion in the `datasets` table.

## Symbols

### `set_default_dataset_usage_data`
#### Description
This function inserts a new record into the `dataset_usage_counts` table for the newly inserted dataset. It uses `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` to handle cases where a record for the dataset might already exist, preventing duplicate entries.

#### Inputs
This function doesn't take any explicit inputs. It implicitly uses the `NEW` record from the triggering `INSERT` statement on the `datasets` table.

#### Outputs
This function returns a trigger result (`TRIGGER`), indicating successful execution.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Insert Statement:** Attempts to insert a new row into the `dataset_usage_counts` table.
   - The `dataset_id` for the new row is taken from the `NEW.id` value, which represents the ID of the newly inserted dataset.
2. **Conflict Handling:** Uses `ON CONFLICT (dataset_id) DO NOTHING` to handle potential duplicate key violations. If a record with the same `dataset_id` already exists, the insert is skipped.
3. **Return:** Returns `NEW`, indicating successful trigger execution.

### `set_default_dataset_usage_data_trigger`
#### Description
This trigger automatically executes the `set_default_dataset_usage_data` function after each new row is inserted into the `datasets` table.

#### Inputs
This trigger implicitly uses the `NEW` record from the triggering `INSERT` statement on the `datasets` table.

#### Outputs
This trigger doesn't have any explicit outputs. It ensures the execution of the associated function.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Trigger Activation:** The trigger is activated `AFTER INSERT` on the `datasets` table, meaning it runs after a successful insertion into the `datasets` table.
2. **Trigger Scope:** It uses `FOR EACH ROW`, indicating that it runs once for every new row inserted.
3. **Function Execution:** It executes the `set_default_dataset_usage_data()` function.
