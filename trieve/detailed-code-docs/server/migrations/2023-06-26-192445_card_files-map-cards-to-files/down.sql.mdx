## High-level description
This SQL migration file is designed to undo the changes made by the corresponding `up.sql` file. It drops the `card_files` table if it exists in the database.

## Symbols

### `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS card_files;`
#### Description
This SQL command is used to remove the `card_files` table from the database schema.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `IF EXISTS` clause is used to prevent errors if the table doesn't exist.
2. If the `card_files` table exists, it will be completely removed from the database, including all its data and structure.

## Side Effects
- If the `card_files` table exists, it will be permanently deleted from the database, along with all its contents.
- Any dependencies on the `card_files` table (such as foreign key constraints, views, or triggers) may be affected or cause errors if not handled properly in the application code.

## Error Handling
The `IF EXISTS` clause provides a basic level of error handling by preventing the command from failing if the table doesn't exist. However, it's important to note that this migration does not include any additional error handling or rollback mechanisms.

## TODOs
The comment at the top of the file, `-- This file should undo anything in `up.sql``, serves as a reminder and guideline for the purpose of this migration file. It suggests that the operations in this file should reverse the changes made by the corresponding `up.sql` file.
