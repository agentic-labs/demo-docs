## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration files for creating and dropping a `card_files` table in a database. The migration is designed to establish a many-to-many relationship between cards and files in the system. The directory includes two SQL files: `up.sql` for creating the table and `down.sql` for dropping it.

## What does it do?
The migration in this directory sets up a new database table called `card_files`. This table acts as a bridge between two other tables: `card_metadata` and `files`. It allows the system to associate multiple files with a single card, and vice versa. This is useful in scenarios where you want to attach various documents, images, or other file types to different cards in your application.

When the migration is applied (using the `up.sql` file), it creates the `card_files` table with columns for unique identifiers, references to both cards and files, and timestamps for tracking when each association was created or last updated. If you need to undo this change, the `down.sql` file provides the necessary command to remove the table entirely.

## Key Files

1. `up.sql`:
   This file contains the SQL commands to create the `card_files` table. It defines the table structure, including:
   - `id`: A unique identifier for each card-file association
   - `card_id`: A reference to a specific card in the `card_metadata` table
   - `file_id`: A reference to a specific file in the `files` table
   - `created_at` and `updated_at`: Timestamps for tracking when the association was created and last modified

   Here's the key part of the `up.sql` file:

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE card_files (
       id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
       card_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES card_metadata(id),
       file_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES files(id),
       created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
       updated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
   );
   ```

2. `down.sql`:
   This file contains the SQL command to drop the `card_files` table, effectively undoing the changes made by `up.sql`. It's a simple one-line command:

   ```sql
   DROP TABLE IF EXISTS card_files;
   ```

## Dependencies
The migration depends on the existence of two other tables in the database:

1. `card_metadata`: This table likely contains information about cards in the system. The `card_id` in `card_files` references the `id` column in this table.
2. `files`: This table presumably stores information about files in the system. The `file_id` in `card_files` references the `id` column in this table.

Both of these tables must exist and have a column named `id` of type UUID for the foreign key constraints to work correctly.

## Configuration
This migration doesn't require any specific configuration. However, it's important to note that it uses UUIDs for primary and foreign keys, which suggests that the database should be configured to support UUID generation (likely using the `uuid-ossp` extension in PostgreSQL).

The migration also uses the `NOW()` function for setting default timestamps, which is a standard function in most relational databases but might need to be adjusted if using a database system that doesn't support this function.

When applying this migration, database administrators or developers should ensure that:
1. The database supports UUID generation.
2. The `card_metadata` and `files` tables exist and have the expected structure.
3. There's enough storage space to accommodate the new table, especially if expecting a large number of card-file associations.
4. Proper access rights are set up for the application to interact with this new table.

This migration is part of a larger system for managing relationships between cards and files, likely in a content management or document organization application. It provides the database structure necessary for implementing features like attaching multiple files to a card or viewing all cards associated with a particular file.
