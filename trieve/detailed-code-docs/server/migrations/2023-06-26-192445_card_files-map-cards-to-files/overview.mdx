## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration files for creating and dropping a `card_files` table in a database. The migration is designed to establish a many-to-many relationship between cards and files in the system. The directory includes two SQL files: `up.sql` for creating the table and `down.sql` for dropping it.

## What does it do?
The migration creates a new table called `card_files` that acts as a bridge between cards and files. This allows the system to associate multiple files with a single card and vice versa. The table stores unique identifiers for both cards and files, along with timestamps for when each association was created and last updated.

When the migration is applied:
1. A new table `card_files` is created in the database.
2. This table can store multiple relationships between cards and files.
3. Each relationship is given a unique identifier.
4. The system can track when each relationship was created and last modified.

If the migration needs to be reversed, the `down.sql` script will remove the `card_files` table entirely, effectively deleting all stored relationships between cards and files.

## Key Files

1. `up.sql`:
   - Creates the `card_files` table with the following columns:
     - `id`: A unique identifier for each card-file relationship
     - `card_id`: A reference to a card in the `card_metadata` table
     - `file_id`: A reference to a file in the `files` table
     - `created_at`: Timestamp of when the relationship was created
     - `updated_at`: Timestamp of when the relationship was last updated
   - Sets up foreign key constraints to ensure data integrity

2. `down.sql`:
   - Drops the `card_files` table if it exists
   - This script is used to undo the changes made by `up.sql`

## Dependencies
The migration depends on the existence of two other tables in the database:

1. `card_metadata`: This table likely contains information about cards in the system.
2. `files`: This table presumably stores information about files in the system.

The `card_files` table references these tables using foreign key constraints, ensuring that only valid cards and files can be associated with each other.

## Configuration
This migration does not require any specific configuration. However, it's important to note that:

1. The migration uses UUIDs for primary and foreign keys, which suggests that the database system must support UUID data types.
2. The `created_at` and `updated_at` columns use the `NOW()` function as a default value, which should be supported by the database system.

When applying this migration, database administrators should ensure that:

1. The database user has sufficient privileges to create tables and foreign key constraints.
2. The `card_metadata` and `files` tables exist in the database before applying this migration.
3. There is enough storage space available for the new table, especially if a large number of card-file associations are expected.

It's also worth noting that reversing this migration (by running the `down.sql` script) will permanently delete all data in the `card_files` table. This action should be performed with caution, and only after ensuring that the data is no longer needed or has been backed up.
