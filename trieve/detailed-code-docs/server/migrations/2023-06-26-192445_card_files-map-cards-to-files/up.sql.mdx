## High-level description
This SQL script creates a new table named `card_files` to establish a many-to-many relationship between cards and files. It defines the structure of the table with primary and foreign keys, as well as timestamp fields for tracking creation and update times.

## Symbols

### `card_files` table
#### Description
The `card_files` table is designed to map cards to files, allowing for a many-to-many relationship between the `card_metadata` and `files` tables.

#### Internal Logic
The table is created with the following columns:
1. `id`: A UUID serving as the primary key for each record.
2. `card_id`: A UUID referencing the `id` column in the `card_metadata` table.
3. `file_id`: A UUID referencing the `id` column in the `files` table.
4. `created_at`: A timestamp recording when the record was created.
5. `updated_at`: A timestamp recording when the record was last updated.

Both `created_at` and `updated_at` columns are set to use the current timestamp (`NOW()`) as the default value.

## Dependencies
This migration script depends on the existence of two other tables:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| card_metadata | Referenced by the `card_id` foreign key |
| files | Referenced by the `file_id` foreign key |

## Notes
- The use of UUIDs for primary and foreign keys suggests a distributed or high-volume system where unique identifiers across multiple instances or large datasets are required.
- The inclusion of `created_at` and `updated_at` fields indicates that the system tracks the lifecycle of these relationships for auditing or data management purposes.
- This table structure allows for efficient querying of relationships between cards and files in both directions (cards associated with a file, and files associated with a card).
