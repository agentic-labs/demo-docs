## High-level description
This SQL migration file creates two new indexes on the `events` table to improve query performance. The indexes are added to the `dataset_id` and `event_type` columns, which are likely frequently used in queries involving the `events` table.

## Symbols

### CREATE INDEX idx_events_dataset_id
#### Description
This SQL command creates an index named `idx_events_dataset_id` on the `dataset_id` column of the `events` table.

#### Internal Logic
The index is created on the `dataset_id` column, which suggests that queries often filter or join on this column. Creating an index will speed up operations that involve searching or sorting by `dataset_id`.

### CREATE INDEX idx_events_event_type
#### Description
This SQL command creates an index named `idx_events_event_type` on the `event_type` column of the `events` table.

#### Internal Logic
The index is created on the `event_type` column, indicating that queries frequently filter or group by event types. This index will improve the performance of queries that involve searching or sorting by `event_type`.

## Performance Considerations
Adding these indexes will significantly improve the performance of queries that filter, sort, or join on the `dataset_id` or `event_type` columns. However, it's important to note that while indexes speed up read operations, they can slightly slow down write operations (inserts, updates, and deletes) as the indexes need to be updated along with the table data.

The choice of columns for indexing (`dataset_id` and `event_type`) suggests that these are frequently used in query conditions or join clauses, making them good candidates for indexing to optimize query performance.
