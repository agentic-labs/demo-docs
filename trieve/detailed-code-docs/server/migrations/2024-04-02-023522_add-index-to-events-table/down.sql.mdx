title: "down.sql"

## High-level description
This SQL migration file is designed to undo the changes made in the corresponding `up.sql` file. It removes two indexes from the `events` table: one for the `dataset_id` column and another for the `event_type` column.

## Symbols

### DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_events_dataset_id
#### Description
This SQL command removes the index named `idx_events_dataset_id` from the `events` table if it exists.

#### Internal Logic
- The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the command will not throw an error if the index doesn't exist.
- This command is idempotent, meaning it can be run multiple times without causing issues.

### DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_events_event_type
#### Description
This SQL command removes the index named `idx_events_event_type` from the `events` table if it exists.

#### Internal Logic
- Similar to the previous command, the `IF EXISTS` clause prevents errors if the index is not present.
- This command is also idempotent.

## Side Effects
- Removing these indexes may impact query performance on the `events` table, particularly for queries that filter or sort by `dataset_id` or `event_type`.
- The database will need to reclaim the space used by these indexes, which could temporarily impact performance during the migration.

## Performance Considerations
- Dropping indexes is generally a fast operation, but it may take longer on large tables or busy systems.
- After dropping these indexes, queries that previously used them may become slower, especially on large datasets.

## Error Handling
The `IF EXISTS` clause in both `DROP INDEX` statements ensures that the migration will not fail if the indexes have already been removed or never existed. This makes the migration more robust and rerunnable.

## TODOs
- Consider adding a comment explaining why these indexes are being removed, especially if it's part of a larger schema change or optimization effort.
- Ensure that the corresponding `up.sql` file creates these indexes, maintaining consistency between the up and down migrations.
- Verify that removing these indexes aligns with the application's performance requirements and query patterns.
