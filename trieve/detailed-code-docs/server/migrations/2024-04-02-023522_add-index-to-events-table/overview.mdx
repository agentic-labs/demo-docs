## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration files for adding and removing indexes on the `events` table in a database. The migration is dated 2024-04-02 and is specifically designed to improve query performance by adding indexes to frequently used columns.

## What does it do?
The migration files in this directory perform the following actions:

1. Add two new indexes to the `events` table:
   - An index on the `dataset_id` column
   - An index on the `event_type` column

2. Provide a way to revert these changes by dropping the newly created indexes

These changes are aimed at improving the performance of database queries that frequently filter, sort, or join on the `dataset_id` or `event_type` columns of the `events` table. By adding these indexes, the database can more quickly locate and retrieve relevant data, resulting in faster query execution times.

## Key Files

### up.sql
This file contains the SQL commands to create the new indexes:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_events_dataset_id ON events (dataset_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_events_event_type ON events (event_type);
```

These commands create two separate indexes:
1. `idx_events_dataset_id`: An index on the `dataset_id` column of the `events` table
2. `idx_events_event_type`: An index on the `event_type` column of the `events` table

### down.sql
This file contains the SQL commands to revert the changes made by `up.sql`:

```sql
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_events_dataset_id;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_events_event_type;
```

These commands drop the two indexes created by the `up.sql` script, effectively undoing the migration. The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the script can be run multiple times without causing errors if the indexes have already been dropped.

## Performance Considerations
Adding these indexes will likely improve the performance of read operations (SELECT queries) that filter, sort, or join on the `dataset_id` or `event_type` columns. However, it's important to note that while indexes speed up read operations, they can slightly slow down write operations (INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE) as the indexes need to be updated along with the table data.

The decision to add these specific indexes suggests that the application frequently queries the `events` table based on `dataset_id` and `event_type`, and the performance gain from faster reads outweighs any potential slowdown in write operations.

When implementing these changes, it's recommended to monitor the database performance before and after the migration to ensure that the expected performance improvements are realized and that there are no unexpected negative impacts on other database operations.
