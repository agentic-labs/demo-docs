## High-level description
This SQL migration script is designed to revert the changes made in the corresponding `up.sql` file. It adds a unique constraint to the `chunk_group` table on the `tracking_id` column.

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE chunk_group
#### Description
This SQL command modifies the structure of the `chunk_group` table by adding a constraint.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `ALTER TABLE` statement is used to modify the `chunk_group` table.
2. The `ADD CONSTRAINT` clause is used to add a new constraint to the table.
3. The constraint is named `chunk_group_tracking_id_key`.
4. The `UNIQUE` keyword specifies that the values in the `tracking_id` column must be unique across all rows in the table.

## Side Effects
- This migration will enforce uniqueness on the `tracking_id` column in the `chunk_group` table.
- Any existing duplicate `tracking_id` values in the table will cause this migration to fail.
- Future attempts to insert or update rows with duplicate `tracking_id` values will be prevented.

## Performance Considerations
Adding a unique constraint may have a slight impact on insert and update operations for the `chunk_group` table, as the database will need to check for uniqueness. However, it can improve query performance when searching or joining on the `tracking_id` column.

## TODOs
The comment at the top of the file suggests that this script is intended to undo changes made in an `up.sql` file. It's important to ensure that this `down.sql` script accurately reverses all changes made in the corresponding `up.sql` file to maintain consistency in the database schema versioning.
