## High-level description
This SQL migration script removes a unique constraint from the `chunk_group` table. Specifically, it drops the constraint named `chunk_group_tracking_id_key`, which was likely enforcing uniqueness on the `tracking_id` column.

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE chunk_group
#### Description
This SQL command modifies the structure of the `chunk_group` table by removing a constraint.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `ALTER TABLE` statement is used to modify the existing `chunk_group` table.
2. The `DROP CONSTRAINT` clause is used to remove a specific constraint from the table.
3. The constraint being removed is named `chunk_group_tracking_id_key`.

## Side Effects
- The `tracking_id` column in the `chunk_group` table will no longer have a unique constraint.
- This change allows duplicate values in the `tracking_id` column, which was previously not allowed.
- Any existing data in the table remains unchanged, but future insertions or updates may now include duplicate `tracking_id` values.

## Performance Considerations
Removing a unique constraint can potentially improve insert and update performance on the `chunk_group` table, as the database no longer needs to check for uniqueness on the `tracking_id` column. However, it may also impact data integrity if uniqueness was a business requirement.

## Dependencies
This migration script relies on the existence of:
1. The `chunk_group` table in the database.
2. A constraint named `chunk_group_tracking_id_key` on the `chunk_group` table.

Note: The script will fail if either the table or the constraint does not exist.

## Error Handling
This script does not include explicit error handling. If the table or constraint doesn't exist, the database system will likely raise an error, and the migration may fail.

## Logging
This script does not implement any logging mechanisms. Any logging would be handled by the database management system or the application running this migration.

## TODOs
- Consider adding a comment explaining why the constraint is being removed, which could help future developers understand the reasoning behind this change.
- Ensure that any application logic relying on the uniqueness of `tracking_id` is updated to handle potential duplicates.
- Review and update any database indexes that might have been relying on this unique constraint for optimization.
