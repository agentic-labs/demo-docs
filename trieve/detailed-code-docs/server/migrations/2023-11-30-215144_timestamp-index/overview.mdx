## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for creating and removing indexes on timestamp columns in two database tables: `card_metadata` and `files`. The migration is dated 2023-11-30, indicating when it was created or intended to be applied.

## What does it do?
The migration scripts in this directory perform the following actions:

1. In the "up" direction (applying the migration):
   - Create an index named `card_time_stamp_index` on the `time_stamp` column of the `card_metadata` table.
   - Create an index named `file_time_stamp_index` on the `time_stamp` column of the `files` table.

2. In the "down" direction (reverting the migration):
   - Remove the `card_time_stamp_index` from the `card_metadata` table.
   - Remove the `file_time_stamp_index` from the `files` table.

These actions are designed to improve the performance of database queries that filter, sort, or join on the `time_stamp` columns in these tables. By creating indexes, the database can more quickly locate and retrieve rows based on timestamp values, potentially speeding up operations like searching for cards or files within a specific time range.

## Key Files

1. `up.sql`:
   This file contains the SQL commands to apply the migration. It creates two indexes:
   ```sql
   CREATE INDEX card_time_stamp_index ON card_metadata(time_stamp);
   CREATE INDEX file_time_stamp_index ON files(time_stamp);
   ```
   These commands add indexes to the `time_stamp` columns in the `card_metadata` and `files` tables, respectively.

2. `down.sql`:
   This file contains the SQL commands to revert the migration. It drops the indexes created by `up.sql`:
   ```sql
   DROP INDEX IF EXISTS card_time_stamp_index;
   DROP INDEX IF EXISTS file_time_stamp_index;
   ```
   The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the drop operations are safe to run even if the indexes don't exist, which could happen if the migration was only partially applied or if there were issues during the initial application.

## Configuration
The migration is identified by its timestamp: 2023-11-30-215144. This timestamp is likely used by a database migration tool to track which migrations have been applied and in what order. The format suggests that this migration was created on November 30, 2023, at 21:51:44 UTC.

No additional configuration is required for these SQL scripts, as they are straightforward index creation and removal commands. However, the database connection details and migration tool configuration would typically be managed elsewhere in the project.
