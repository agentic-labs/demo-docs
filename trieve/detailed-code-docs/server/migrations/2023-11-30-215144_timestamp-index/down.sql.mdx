title: "down.sql"

## High-level description
This SQL migration file is designed to undo the changes made in the corresponding `up.sql` file. It removes two indexes that were likely created to improve query performance on timestamp columns in the `card` and `file` tables.

## Symbols

### `DROP INDEX IF EXISTS card_time_stamp_index;`
#### Description
This SQL command removes the index named `card_time_stamp_index` if it exists in the database.

#### Internal Logic
- The `DROP INDEX` statement is used to remove an existing index from the database.
- `IF EXISTS` is a safety clause that prevents an error if the index doesn't exist.
- `card_time_stamp_index` is the name of the index being dropped, which was likely created on a timestamp column in the `card` table.

### `DROP INDEX IF EXISTS file_time_stamp_index;`
#### Description
This SQL command removes the index named `file_time_stamp_index` if it exists in the database.

#### Internal Logic
- Similar to the previous command, this `DROP INDEX` statement removes an existing index.
- `IF EXISTS` prevents an error if the index is not present.
- `file_time_stamp_index` is the name of the index being dropped, which was probably created on a timestamp column in the `file` table.

## Side Effects
- Removing these indexes will likely decrease the query performance for operations that were using these indexes, particularly for queries involving timestamp-based filtering or sorting on the `card` and `file` tables.
- The database size may slightly decrease due to the removal of the index structures.

## Performance Considerations
- After dropping these indexes, queries that relied on them for optimization may become slower, especially for large datasets.
- The impact on write operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) might be positive, as maintaining these indexes during write operations is no longer necessary.

## TODOs
- It might be beneficial to add a comment explaining why these indexes are being removed, especially if it's part of a larger schema change or optimization strategy.
- Consider adding error handling or logging to capture any issues that might occur during the index removal process.
