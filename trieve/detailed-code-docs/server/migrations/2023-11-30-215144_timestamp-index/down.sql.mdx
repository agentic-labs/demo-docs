## High-level description
This SQL script reverts the database migration defined in the corresponding `up.sql` file, specifically by removing two indexes related to timestamps: `card_time_stamp_index` and `file_time_stamp_index`. This suggests that the `up.sql` file likely creates these indexes.

## Symbols

### `DROP INDEX IF EXISTS card_time_stamp_index;`
#### Description
This line attempts to drop an index named `card_time_stamp_index`. The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the operation doesn't fail if the index doesn't exist. This is a safe way to revert a migration step that might have failed to apply in the first place.

#### Internal Logic
- Checks if the index `card_time_stamp_index` exists in the database.
- If it exists, the index is dropped.
- If it doesn't exist, the statement does nothing.

### `DROP INDEX IF EXISTS file_time_stamp_index;`
#### Description
This line is identical to the previous one, except it targets an index named `file_time_stamp_index`. It follows the same logic of safely dropping the index only if it exists.
#### Internal Logic
- Checks if the index `file_time_stamp_index` exists in the database.
- If it exists, the index is dropped.
- If it doesn't exist, the statement does nothing.
