## High-level description
This SQL script creates two indexes on the `time_stamp` column in the `card_metadata` and `files` tables, respectively. This is likely done to improve the performance of queries that filter or sort by the `time_stamp` column. 

## Symbols

### `CREATE INDEX card_time_stamp_index ON card_metadata(time_stamp);`
#### Description
This statement creates an index named `card_time_stamp_index` on the `time_stamp` column of the `card_metadata` table. 

#### Internal Logic
Creating an index on a column helps speed up queries that use that column in a `WHERE` clause, `JOIN` condition, or `ORDER BY` clause. 

### `CREATE INDEX file_time_stamp_index ON files(time_stamp);`
#### Description
This statement creates an index named `file_time_stamp_index` on the `time_stamp` column of the `files` table. 

#### Internal Logic
Similar to the previous statement, this index is created to improve the performance of queries that involve the `time_stamp` column in the `files` table.
