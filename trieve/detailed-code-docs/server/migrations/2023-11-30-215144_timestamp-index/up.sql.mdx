## High-level description
This SQL migration script creates two new indexes on timestamp columns in the database. It adds an index on the `time_stamp` column of the `card_metadata` table and another index on the `time_stamp` column of the `files` table.

## Symbols

### `CREATE INDEX card_time_stamp_index ON card_metadata(time_stamp);`
#### Description
This SQL statement creates an index named `card_time_stamp_index` on the `time_stamp` column of the `card_metadata` table.

#### Internal Logic
- The index is created on the `card_metadata` table.
- It specifically indexes the `time_stamp` column.
- This will improve query performance for operations that involve searching or sorting by the `time_stamp` column in the `card_metadata` table.

### `CREATE INDEX file_time_stamp_index ON files(time_stamp);`
#### Description
This SQL statement creates an index named `file_time_stamp_index` on the `time_stamp` column of the `files` table.

#### Internal Logic
- The index is created on the `files` table.
- It specifically indexes the `time_stamp` column.
- This will improve query performance for operations that involve searching or sorting by the `time_stamp` column in the `files` table.

## Performance Considerations
- Adding these indexes will improve the speed of queries that filter or sort by the `time_stamp` column in either the `card_metadata` or `files` tables.
- However, it's important to note that while indexes speed up read operations, they can slightly slow down write operations (inserts, updates, and deletes) as the indexes need to be updated along with the table data.
- The performance benefit for read operations usually outweighs the small overhead for write operations, especially for columns frequently used in WHERE clauses or for sorting.

## Dependencies
This migration script assumes the existence of:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `card_metadata` table | The table where the `card_time_stamp_index` is being created |
| `files` table | The table where the `file_time_stamp_index` is being created |
| `time_stamp` column in both tables | The column on which the indexes are being created |

Note: The script does not create these tables or columns; it assumes they already exist in the database schema.
