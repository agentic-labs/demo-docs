title: "down.sql"
---

## High-level description
This SQL script defines a database migration that reverts changes introduced by a previous migration, specifically the removal of the "hash" column and potentially the "name" column from the "users" table. This suggests an operation to restore the table structure to its state before the "up.sql" migration was applied.

## Symbols

### `ALTER TABLE "users" ADD COLUMN "hash" VARCHAR(255) NULL;`
#### Description
This statement adds a column named "hash" to the "users" table. The column is of type VARCHAR with a maximum length of 255 characters and allows NULL values.

#### Internal Logic
- **`ALTER TABLE "users"`**:  This part specifies that the "users" table is being modified.
- **`ADD COLUMN "hash"`**: This adds a new column named "hash" to the table.
- **`VARCHAR(255)`**: This defines the data type of the new column as VARCHAR, allowing strings up to 255 characters.
- **`NULL`**: This allows the "hash" column to contain NULL values.

### `ALTER TABLE "users" DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS "name" ;`
#### Description
This statement attempts to drop the column named "name" from the "users" table. The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the operation doesn't fail if the "name" column doesn't exist.

#### Internal Logic
- **`ALTER TABLE "users"`**: This part specifies that the "users" table is being modified.
- **`DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS "name"`**: This attempts to drop the column named "name". The `IF EXISTS` clause prevents an error if the column is already absent.
