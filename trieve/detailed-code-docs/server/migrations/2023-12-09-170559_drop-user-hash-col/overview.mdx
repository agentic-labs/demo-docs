## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for modifying the structure of the "users" table in a database. The migration is specifically focused on dropping the "hash" column and adding a "name" column. The directory includes both "up" and "down" migration scripts to allow for applying and reverting these changes.

## What does it do?
The migration scripts in this directory perform the following actions:

1. In the "up" migration:
   - Removes the "hash" column from the "users" table, which likely contained password hashes or similar sensitive information.
   - Adds a new "name" column to the "users" table, allowing for the storage of user names as text.

2. In the "down" migration:
   - Adds back the "hash" column to the "users" table, allowing for the storage of password hashes or similar data.
   - Removes the "name" column from the "users" table, reverting the change made in the "up" migration.

These changes suggest a shift in how user data is stored and managed within the application. The removal of the "hash" column might indicate a change in authentication methods or a move towards a different way of storing sensitive user data. The addition of the "name" column implies that the application now requires or allows for storing user names directly in the database.

## Key Files

1. `up.sql`:
   This file contains the SQL commands to apply the migration. It drops the "hash" column and adds the "name" column to the "users" table.

   ```sql
   -- Your SQL goes here
   ALTER TABLE "users" DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS "hash";
   ALTER TABLE "users" ADD COLUMN "name" TEXT NULL;
   ```

2. `down.sql`:
   This file contains the SQL commands to revert the migration. It adds back the "hash" column and removes the "name" column from the "users" table.

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE "users" ADD COLUMN "hash" VARCHAR(255) NULL;
   ALTER TABLE "users" DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS "name" ;
   ```

Both files work together to provide a reversible database schema change, allowing developers to apply or roll back the migration as needed.

## Dependencies
The migration scripts rely on a SQL-compatible database system. While the specific system is not explicitly mentioned, the SQL syntax suggests compatibility with popular database management systems like PostgreSQL or MySQL.

## Configuration
These migration scripts do not require additional configuration. However, they assume the existence of a "users" table in the database. The database connection and execution of these scripts would typically be managed by a migration tool or framework used in the larger application context.

## Notes
1. The migration scripts use `IF EXISTS` clauses in the `DROP COLUMN` statements, providing some level of error handling by preventing errors if the columns don't exist.
2. The "hash" column is defined as `VARCHAR(255)`, which is a common choice for storing password hashes.
3. The "name" column is defined as `TEXT`, allowing for variable-length user names.
4. Both columns are defined as `NULL`, meaning they can contain null values. This might require additional application-level validation to ensure data integrity.
5. The comment "-- Your SQL goes here" in the `up.sql` file suggests that this might be based on a template. In a production environment, this comment should be replaced with a more descriptive explanation of the migration's purpose.
6. When applying these migrations, developers should be aware of potential data loss, particularly when dropping the "hash" column. Any existing data in this column will be permanently removed when the "up" migration is applied.
7. The migration scripts do not include data migration logic. If there's a need to preserve or transform existing data during this schema change, additional scripts or application logic would be required.

These migration scripts provide a clear and reversible way to update the database schema, allowing for easy application and rollback of changes to the "users" table structure.
