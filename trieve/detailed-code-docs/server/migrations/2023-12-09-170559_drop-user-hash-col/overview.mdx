## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for altering the structure of the "users" table in a database. The migration involves dropping the "hash" column and adding a new "name" column. The directory includes both "up" and "down" migration scripts, allowing for the application and reversal of these changes.

## What does it do?
These migration scripts modify the structure of the "users" table in the database. The "up" migration removes an existing "hash" column, which might have been used for storing password hashes or other user-related hash values. It then adds a new "name" column to store user names as text. This change could be part of a shift in how user data is stored or processed in the application.

The "down" migration does the opposite: it adds back the "hash" column and removes the "name" column, effectively reverting the changes made by the "up" migration. This allows for easy rollback of the database changes if needed.

These migrations enable the application to evolve its data structure while maintaining the ability to revert changes, which is crucial for database version control and application deployment processes.

## Key Files

1. `up.sql`:
   This file contains the SQL commands to apply the migration. It performs two main actions:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE users DROP COLUMN hash;
   ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN name TEXT NULL;
   ```
   These commands remove the "hash" column and add a new "name" column to the "users" table.

2. `down.sql`:
   This file contains the SQL commands to revert the migration. It performs the following actions:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE "users" ADD COLUMN "hash" VARCHAR(255) NULL;
   ALTER TABLE "users" DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS "name";
   ```
   These commands add back the "hash" column and attempt to remove the "name" column, effectively undoing the changes made by the "up" migration.

Both files work together to provide a reversible change to the database schema, allowing for easy updates and rollbacks of the application's data structure.

## Configuration
The migration scripts use SQL commands specific to the database system being used (likely PostgreSQL, given the syntax). The configuration for these migrations would typically be managed by a database migration tool or framework, which would handle the execution of these scripts in the correct order and track which migrations have been applied.

Key configurable elements in these scripts include:

1. Table name: "users"
2. Column names: "hash" and "name"
3. Data types: VARCHAR(255) for "hash", TEXT for "name"
4. Nullability: Both columns are defined as nullable (NULL)

These elements could be adjusted based on the specific requirements of the application, such as changing the column names, adjusting data types, or modifying nullability constraints.
