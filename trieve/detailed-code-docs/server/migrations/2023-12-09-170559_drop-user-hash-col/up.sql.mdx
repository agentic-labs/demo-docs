## High-level description
This SQL migration script modifies the `users` table by removing the `hash` column and adding a new `name` column. It's part of a database schema update, likely to adjust user data storage requirements.

### SQL Commands

#### Description
The script contains two SQL ALTER TABLE commands that modify the structure of the `users` table.

#### Internal Logic
1. The first command drops the `hash` column from the `users` table.
2. The second command adds a new `name` column to the `users` table with TEXT data type and allowing NULL values.

## Side Effects
- The `users` table structure is permanently modified.
- Any existing data in the `hash` column will be lost.
- A new `name` column is added, which can store textual data and allow NULL values.

## Performance Considerations
- Dropping a column and adding a new one are typically fast operations, but the impact may vary depending on the size of the `users` table and the database system being used.
- If there are any indexes or constraints related to the `hash` column, they will be automatically removed along with the column.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| SQL Database System | Executes the ALTER TABLE commands to modify the database schema |

Note: The specific database system (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) is not explicitly mentioned in the script, but it's required to execute these SQL commands.

## Error Handling
This script does not include explicit error handling. If an error occurs during execution (e.g., if the `hash` column doesn't exist or if there's already a `name` column), the database system will typically raise an error and roll back the transaction.

## TODOs
The comment "-- Your SQL goes here" at the beginning of the file suggests that this might be a template or placeholder for migration scripts. In a production environment, this comment should be removed or replaced with a more descriptive comment about the purpose of the migration.
