title: "up.sql"

## High-level description
This SQL script migrates the database by removing the `chunk_collisions` table and updating the `chunk_metadata` table to make the `qdrant_point_id` column non-nullable. This suggests a shift in data structure or relationships within the application.

## Symbols
### `up.sql`
#### Description
This SQL script defines the "up" migration for removing potential collisions in the database. It performs the following actions:

1. **Deletes orphaned records:** Removes entries from the `chunk_metadata` table where the `qdrant_point_id` is NULL. This cleans up data inconsistencies before enforcing the non-nullable constraint.
2. **Alters table schema:** Modifies the `chunk_metadata` table to make the `qdrant_point_id` column non-nullable. This ensures data integrity by requiring a valid `qdrant_point_id` for each chunk metadata entry.
3. **Drops obsolete table:** Removes the `chunk_collisions` table entirely. This suggests that the concept of chunk collisions is no longer relevant or handled differently in the updated schema.

#### Internal Logic
The script uses standard SQL commands to perform the migration:

* **`DELETE FROM`**: Removes rows from the `chunk_metadata` table based on the specified condition.
* **`ALTER TABLE ... ALTER COLUMN ... SET NOT NULL`**: Modifies the column definition to enforce the non-nullable constraint.
* **`DROP TABLE IF EXISTS`**: Safely removes the table only if it exists, preventing errors if the table was already removed in a previous migration attempt. 

#### Side Effects
This migration script directly modifies the database schema and potentially deletes data:

* **Data deletion:** Rows in the `chunk_metadata` table with a NULL `qdrant_point_id` will be permanently deleted.
* **Schema change:** The `chunk_metadata` table will be altered, and the `chunk_collisions` table will be removed. This may impact applications or other database scripts that rely on the previous schema.
