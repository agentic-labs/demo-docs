## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for a database schema change related to removing collisions and modifying the `chunk_metadata` table. The migration is identified by the timestamp 2024-07-03-200355 and is titled "remove-collisions". It consists of two files: `up.sql` for applying the changes and `down.sql` for reverting them.

## What does it do?
This migration performs the following actions:

1. Cleans up the database by removing any entries in the `chunk_metadata` table that have a NULL `qdrant_point_id`.
2. Modifies the `chunk_metadata` table to make the `qdrant_point_id` column non-nullable, ensuring that all entries must have a valid ID.
3. Removes the `chunk_collisions` table entirely, suggesting that this concept is no longer needed in the updated schema.

If these changes need to be reverted, the `down.sql` script will:

1. Alter the `chunk_metadata` table to allow NULL values in the `qdrant_point_id` column again.
2. Recreate the `chunk_collisions` table with its original structure.

## Key Files

### up.sql
This file contains the SQL commands to apply the migration:

```sql
DELETE FROM chunk_metadata WHERE qdrant_point_id IS NULL;
ALTER TABLE chunk_metadata ALTER COLUMN qdrant_point_id SET NOT NULL;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS chunk_collisions;
```

### down.sql
This file contains the SQL commands to revert the migration:

```sql
ALTER TABLE chunk_metadata ALTER COLUMN qdrant_point_id DROP NOT NULL;

CREATE TABLE chunk_collisions (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    chunk_id UUID NOT NULL,
    collision_qdrant_id UUID,
    created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL
);
```

## Dependencies
This migration relies on the existing database schema and assumes the presence of a `chunk_metadata` table with a `qdrant_point_id` column. It also assumes the existence of a `chunk_collisions` table prior to the migration.

## Configuration
No specific configuration is required for this migration. However, it's important to note that this migration may have significant impacts on the application's data model and functionality. The removal of the `chunk_collisions` table and the enforcement of non-null `qdrant_point_id` values in `chunk_metadata` suggest a change in how the application handles data relationships or uniqueness constraints.

Developers should ensure that:
1. Any application code relying on the `chunk_collisions` table is updated accordingly.
2. The application can handle the new constraint of non-null `qdrant_point_id` values in the `chunk_metadata` table.
3. There's a backup of the database before applying this migration, as it involves data deletion and schema changes that cannot be easily undone without the `down.sql` script.
