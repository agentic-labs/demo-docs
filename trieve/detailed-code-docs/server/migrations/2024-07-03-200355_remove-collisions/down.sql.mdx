title: "down.sql"
---

## High-level description
This SQL script defines the **down** migration step for reverting changes introduced by the migration `2024-07-03-200355_remove-collisions`. It aims to undo the removal of the `chunk_collisions` table and the alteration of the `qdrant_point_id` column in the `chunk_metadata` table. 

This script is likely part of a database migration framework, where `up.sql` defines changes to apply and `down.sql` defines how to revert those changes.

## Code Structure
The script executes two main SQL statements sequentially:
1. **Altering `chunk_metadata` table:** Makes the `qdrant_point_id` column non-nullable.
2. **Recreating `chunk_collisions` table:** Defines the table structure with its columns and constraints.

## Symbols

### `ALTER TABLE chunk_metadata ...`
#### Description
This SQL statement modifies the existing `chunk_metadata` table by altering the `qdrant_point_id` column. It sets the column back to being `NOT NULL`, meaning it cannot contain null values.

#### Internal Logic
- `ALTER TABLE chunk_metadata`: Specifies the table to be modified.
- `ALTER COLUMN qdrant_point_id`: Targets the specific column for alteration.
- `DROP NOT NULL`: Removes the `NOT NULL` constraint from the column, allowing it to hold null values again.

### `CREATE TABLE chunk_collisions ...`
#### Description
This SQL statement recreates the `chunk_collisions` table, which was presumably dropped in the `up.sql` migration. It defines the table structure with its columns and their respective data types and constraints.

#### Internal Logic
- `CREATE TABLE chunk_collisions`: Defines a new table named `chunk_collisions`.
- `id UUID PRIMARY KEY`: Creates a `UUID` column named `id` as the primary key, ensuring uniqueness and acting as the default identifier.
- `chunk_id UUID NOT NULL`: Creates a `UUID` column named `chunk_id`, which cannot be null.
- `collision_qdrant_id UUID`: Creates a `UUID` column named `collision_qdrant_id`, allowing null values.
- `created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL`: Creates a timestamp column named `created_at`, recording row creation time and disallowing null values.
- `updated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL`: Creates a timestamp column named `updated_at`, recording row update time and disallowing null values.
