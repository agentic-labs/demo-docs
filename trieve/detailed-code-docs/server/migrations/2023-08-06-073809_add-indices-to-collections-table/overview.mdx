## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for adding and removing indices on the `card_collection` and `card_collection_bookmarks` tables in a database. The migration is dated 2023-08-06 and is identified by the timestamp 073809. The purpose of these scripts is to improve query performance for specific columns in these tables.

## What does it do?
The migration scripts in this directory perform the following actions:

1. In the "up" migration:
   - Add indices to the `card_collection` table for the columns: `author_id`, `is_public`, `created_at`, and `updated_at`.
   - Add indices to the `card_collection_bookmarks` table for the columns: `collection_id`, `card_metadata_id`, `created_at`, and `updated_at`.

2. In the "down" migration:
   - Remove all the indices added in the "up" migration from both tables.

These changes are designed to optimize database queries that filter or sort by the indexed columns, potentially improving the overall performance of the application.

## Key Files

### up.sql
This file contains the SQL commands to create the new indices on the specified tables. Here's a breakdown of the indices being added:

For the `card_collection` table:
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_card_collection_author_id ON card_collection (author_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_card_collection_is_public ON card_collection (is_public);
CREATE INDEX idx_card_collection_created_at ON card_collection (created_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_card_collection_updated_at ON card_collection (updated_at);
```

For the `card_collection_bookmarks` table:
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_card_collection_bookmarks_collection_id ON card_collection_bookmarks (collection_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_card_collection_bookmarks_card_metadata_id ON card_collection_bookmarks (card_metadata_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_card_collection_bookmarks_created_at ON card_collection_bookmarks (created_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_card_collection_bookmarks_updated_at ON card_collection_bookmarks (updated_at);
```

### down.sql
This file contains the SQL commands to remove the indices added by the up.sql script. It uses the `DROP INDEX IF EXISTS` statement to ensure that the script can be run multiple times without causing errors. Here's an example of the commands:

```sql
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_card_collection_author_id;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_card_collection_is_public;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_card_collection_created_at;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_card_collection_updated_at;

DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_card_collection_bookmarks_collection_id;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_card_collection_bookmarks_card_metadata_id;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_card_collection_bookmarks_created_at;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_card_collection_bookmarks_updated_at;
```

## Configuration
This migration does not require any specific configuration files or environment variables. The SQL scripts are designed to be run as part of a database migration process, typically managed by an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool or a database migration framework.

The naming convention of the directory (2023-08-06-073809_add-indices-to-collections-table) suggests that this migration is part of a versioned migration system, where the timestamp in the directory name is used to determine the order of migrations.

## Error Handling
The `down.sql` script includes basic error handling through the use of the `IF EXISTS` clause in the `DROP INDEX` statements. This ensures that the script will not fail if an index has already been removed or doesn't exist.

The `up.sql` script doesn't include explicit error handling. It's assumed that the migration framework or tool running these scripts will handle any errors that occur during the index creation process, such as attempting to create an index that already exists.

In conclusion, this migration is a straightforward database schema modification to improve query performance on specific columns of the `card_collection` and `card_collection_bookmarks` tables. The reversible nature of the migration (with separate up and down scripts) allows for easy application and rollback of these changes as needed.
