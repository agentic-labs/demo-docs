## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for adding and removing indices on the `card_collection` and `card_collection_bookmarks` tables in a database. The migration is dated 2023-08-06 and is designed to improve query performance for these tables.

## What does it do?
The migration scripts in this directory perform the following actions:

1. Add indices to specific columns in the `card_collection` and `card_collection_bookmarks` tables to improve query performance.
2. Provide a way to revert these changes by removing the added indices.

These changes are typically used in database systems to optimize the speed of data retrieval operations, especially for frequently accessed or filtered columns. By adding indices, the database can more quickly locate and sort data based on the indexed columns, which can significantly improve the performance of read operations.

## Key Files

### up.sql
This file contains the SQL commands to create new indices on the `card_collection` and `card_collection_bookmarks` tables. Here's what it does:

1. For the `card_collection` table, it creates indices on:
   - `author_id`
   - `is_public`
   - `created_at`
   - `updated_at`

2. For the `card_collection_bookmarks` table, it creates indices on:
   - `collection_id`
   - `card_metadata_id`
   - `created_at`
   - `updated_at`

Example of index creation:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_card_collection_author_id ON card_collection(author_id);
```

### down.sql
This file contains the SQL commands to remove the indices created by the `up.sql` script. It uses `DROP INDEX IF EXISTS` statements to safely remove each index. For example:

```sql
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_card_collection_author_id;
```

This ensures that the migration can be safely rolled back without causing errors if the indices don't exist.

## Configuration
These migration scripts don't require any specific configuration. They are designed to be run by a database migration tool, which would typically be configured in the main application settings. The migration tool would use the timestamp in the directory name (2023-08-06-073809) to determine the order of execution for this migration relative to others.

## Performance Considerations
While adding indices can significantly improve read performance for queries that use the indexed columns, it's important to note that they come with trade-offs:

1. Increased storage space: Each index requires additional storage in the database.
2. Slower write operations: Inserts, updates, and deletes may become slightly slower as the database needs to update the indices as well.
3. Maintenance overhead: The database needs to maintain these indices, which can impact overall system performance.

Therefore, these indices should be chosen carefully based on the most common and performance-critical queries in the application. The specific columns chosen for indexing (author_id, is_public, created_at, updated_at, collection_id, card_metadata_id) suggest that these are frequently used in filtering, sorting, or joining operations in the application's queries.
