## Symbols

### `ALTER TABLE organizations ADD CONSTRAINT organizations_name_key UNIQUE (name);`
#### Description
This SQL statement adds a unique constraint to the `organizations` table.

#### Internal Logic
1. **`ALTER TABLE organizations`**: This part specifies that we are modifying the `organizations` table.
2. **`ADD CONSTRAINT organizations_name_key`**: This adds a new constraint named `organizations_name_key` to the table.
3. **`UNIQUE (name)`**: This defines the constraint as a unique constraint on the `name` column. This means that no two rows in the `organizations` table can have the same value in the `name` column.
