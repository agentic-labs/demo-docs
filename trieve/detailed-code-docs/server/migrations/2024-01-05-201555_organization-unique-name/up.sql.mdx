## Symbols

### `ALTER TABLE organizations ADD CONSTRAINT organizations_name_key UNIQUE (name);`
#### Description
This SQL statement adds a unique constraint to the `organizations` table.

#### Internal Logic
1. **`ALTER TABLE organizations`**: This part of the statement specifies that we are going to modify the `organizations` table.
2. **`ADD CONSTRAINT organizations_name_key`**: This adds a new constraint to the table named `organizations_name_key`.
3. **`UNIQUE (name)`**: This defines the type and target of the constraint. It specifies that the constraint is a `UNIQUE` constraint, meaning that all values in the `name` column must be unique.
