## High-level description
This SQL script performs a database migration that removes the uniqueness constraint on the `name` column in the `organizations` table. This effectively reverts a change that likely enforced unique organization names.

## Symbols

### `ALTER TABLE organizations DROP CONSTRAINT organizations_name_key;`
#### Description
This SQL statement removes the constraint named `organizations_name_key` from the `organizations` table. This constraint likely enforced the uniqueness of organization names.

#### Internal Logic
- **`ALTER TABLE organizations`**: This clause specifies that the `organizations` table is being modified.
- **`DROP CONSTRAINT organizations_name_key`**: This clause removes the constraint named `organizations_name_key`. 

#### Side Effects
- After executing this script, the `name` column in the `organizations` table will no longer have a uniqueness constraint. This means that multiple organizations can have the same name.
