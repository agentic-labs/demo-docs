## High-level description
This SQL script is a database migration rollback script. It aims to undo the changes introduced by the corresponding `up.sql` migration file, specifically by removing a unique constraint on the 'name' column of the 'organizations' table.

## Symbols

### `ALTER TABLE organizations DROP CONSTRAINT organizations_name_key;`
#### Description
This SQL statement removes the unique constraint named 'organizations_name_key' from the 'organizations' table. This implies that the 'name' column in the 'organizations' table will no longer be required to have unique values after this statement is executed.

#### Internal Logic
- **`ALTER TABLE organizations`**: This part specifies that the 'organizations' table is being modified.
- **`DROP CONSTRAINT organizations_name_key`**: This part instructs the database to remove the constraint named 'organizations_name_key'.

#### Side Effects
- **Removes uniqueness constraint**: After executing this statement, the 'name' column in the 'organizations' table will no longer be constrained to unique values. This means duplicate organization names will be permitted.
