title: "down.sql"

## High-level description
This SQL migration file is designed to revert the changes made in the corresponding `up.sql` file. It removes the `normal_chat` column from the `topics` table in the database.

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE topics DROP COLUMN normal_chat;
#### Description
This SQL statement removes the `normal_chat` column from the `topics` table.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `ALTER TABLE` command is used to modify the structure of an existing table.
2. `topics` is the name of the table being altered.
3. `DROP COLUMN` is used to remove a column from the table.
4. `normal_chat` is the name of the column being removed.

## Side Effects
- This migration will permanently remove the `normal_chat` column and all its data from the `topics` table.
- Any queries or application code that relies on the `normal_chat` column will need to be updated to avoid errors.

## Performance Considerations
- Dropping a column is generally a quick operation, but it may take longer if the table contains a large amount of data.
- This operation may briefly lock the `topics` table, potentially affecting concurrent database operations.

## TODOs
The comment at the top of the file ("This file should undo anything in `up.sql`") suggests that this migration is intended to revert changes made in a corresponding `up.sql` file. It's important to ensure that this `down.sql` file correctly undoes all changes made in the associated `up.sql` file to maintain database consistency during migrations.
