title: "down.sql"
---

## High-level description
This SQL script performs a database migration that reverts a change made to the `topics` table. Specifically, it drops the `normal_chat` column. This suggests that the `up.sql` migration likely added this column, and this script undoes that action.

## Symbols

### `ALTER TABLE topics DROP COLUMN normal_chat;`
#### Description
This SQL statement removes the `normal_chat` column from the `topics` table.

#### Internal Logic
- **`ALTER TABLE topics`**: This clause specifies that the `topics` table is being modified.
- **`DROP COLUMN normal_chat`**: This clause instructs the database to remove the column named `normal_chat`.

#### Side Effects
- The `normal_chat` column will be permanently removed from the `topics` table.
- Any data previously stored in the `normal_chat` column will be lost.
