## High-level description
This SQL migration script adds a new column called `normal_chat` to the `topics` table. The new column is of type boolean, not nullable, and has a default value of false.

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE topics
#### Description
This SQL command modifies the structure of the existing `topics` table by adding a new column.

#### Internal Logic
1. Targets the `topics` table for modification.
2. Adds a new column named `normal_chat`.
3. Sets the data type of the new column to boolean.
4. Specifies that the column cannot contain NULL values (NOT NULL).
5. Sets a default value of false for the new column.

## Side Effects
- This migration will modify the structure of the `topics` table in the database.
- All existing rows in the `topics` table will have the `normal_chat` column added with a default value of false.
- Any future inserts into the `topics` table will require a value for the `normal_chat` column (or will use the default value of false if not specified).

## Performance Considerations
- Depending on the size of the `topics` table and the database system being used, this alteration might temporarily lock the table or cause a brief interruption in write operations.
- For large tables, it's recommended to run this migration during a maintenance window or low-traffic period.

## TODOs
The comment "-- Your SQL goes here" at the beginning of the file suggests that this might be a template or placeholder for SQL migrations. In a production environment, it's recommended to remove or replace such comments with more specific documentation about the purpose of this particular migration.
