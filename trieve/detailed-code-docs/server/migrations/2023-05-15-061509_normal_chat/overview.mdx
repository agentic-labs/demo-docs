## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for adding and removing a `normal_chat` column to the `topics` table in a database. The migration is dated 2023-05-15, and it includes both "up" and "down" scripts to apply and revert the changes respectively.

## What does it do?
These migration scripts modify the structure of the `topics` table in the database. The "up" migration adds a new boolean column called `normal_chat` to the table, which is set to not allow null values and has a default value of false. This column likely indicates whether a topic is associated with a normal chat or not.

The "down" migration does the opposite - it removes the `normal_chat` column from the `topics` table. This allows for reverting the changes made by the "up" migration if needed.

These migrations enable the application to track whether a topic is related to a normal chat, which could be used for filtering, sorting, or other functionality in the application.

## Key Files

1. `up.sql`: This file contains the SQL script to add the `normal_chat` column to the `topics` table.

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE topics ADD COLUMN normal_chat boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT false;
   ```

   This script adds a new boolean column `normal_chat` to the `topics` table. The column is set to not allow null values (`NOT NULL`) and has a default value of `false`. This means that when new topics are created, they will be considered not normal chats by default unless specified otherwise.

2. `down.sql`: This file contains the SQL script to remove the `normal_chat` column from the `topics` table.

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE topics DROP COLUMN normal_chat;
   ```

   This script removes the `normal_chat` column from the `topics` table, effectively undoing the changes made by the `up.sql` script.

## Configuration
The migration scripts don't require any specific configuration. However, they are part of a larger migration system, likely managed by an ORM or database migration tool. The naming convention of the directory (2023-05-15-061509_normal_chat) suggests that these migrations are automatically picked up and executed in order based on their timestamp.

It's important to note that executing these migrations will permanently alter the database schema. The `up.sql` script will add a new column, potentially affecting existing queries and application logic. The `down.sql` script will remove this column, which could result in data loss if not handled carefully.

When applying these migrations, ensure that:
1. Any existing application code that interacts with the `topics` table is updated to handle the new `normal_chat` column.
2. If reverting the migration (running `down.sql`), make sure that no critical data stored in the `normal_chat` column will be lost.
3. The database user executing these migrations has the necessary permissions to alter table structures.

These migration scripts provide a systematic way to evolve the database schema alongside the application code, allowing for version control of database changes and easier deployment across different environments.
