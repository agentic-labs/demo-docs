## High-level description
This SQL migration script modifies the `files` table by adding a new `metadata` column of type JSONB and removing the existing `mime_type` column. This change allows for more flexible and structured metadata storage for files.

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE files ADD COLUMN metadata JSONB NULL DEFAULT '{}'::JSONB;
#### Description
This SQL statement adds a new column named `metadata` to the `files` table.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| metadata | JSONB | A JSON object to store file metadata |

#### Internal Logic
- The new column is of type JSONB, which allows for storing JSON data with indexing and querying capabilities.
- It is set to allow NULL values.
- The default value is an empty JSON object (`'{}'::JSONB`).

### ALTER TABLE files DROP COLUMN mime_type;
#### Description
This SQL statement removes the `mime_type` column from the `files` table.

#### Internal Logic
- The existing `mime_type` column is completely removed from the `files` table structure.

## Side Effects
- The `files` table structure is permanently modified.
- Any existing data in the `mime_type` column will be lost after this migration.
- Applications or queries relying on the `mime_type` column will need to be updated to use the new `metadata` column instead.

## Performance Considerations
- Adding the JSONB column may have a small impact on table size and insert/update performance, especially for large tables.
- Removing the `mime_type` column will slightly reduce the table's storage requirements.
- Queries that previously used the `mime_type` column might need to be rewritten to use JSONB operators, which could affect query performance.

## Error Handling
This migration does not include explicit error handling. If there are any issues during the execution (e.g., insufficient permissions, table doesn't exist), the database system will raise an error and roll back the transaction.
