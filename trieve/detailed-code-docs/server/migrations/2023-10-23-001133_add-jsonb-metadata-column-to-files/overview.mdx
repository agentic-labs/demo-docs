## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for modifying the `files` table in a database. The migration adds a new `metadata` column of type JSONB and removes the existing `mime_type` column. This change allows for more flexible and structured metadata storage for files. The directory includes both "up" and "down" migration scripts to apply and revert the changes, respectively.

## What does it do?
The migration scripts in this directory perform the following actions:

1. In the "up" migration:
   - Add a new column called `metadata` to the `files` table. This column is of type JSONB, which allows storing structured JSON data with advanced querying capabilities.
   - Remove the existing `mime_type` column from the `files` table.

2. In the "down" migration:
   - Remove the `metadata` column from the `files` table.
   - Add back the `mime_type` column to the `files` table.

These changes enable the application to store more flexible and comprehensive metadata for files, moving from a simple text-based `mime_type` to a structured JSON object that can contain various properties related to the file.

## Key Files
1. `up.sql`: This file contains the SQL commands to apply the migration, adding the `metadata` column and removing the `mime_type` column.

2. `down.sql`: This file contains the SQL commands to revert the migration, removing the `metadata` column and adding back the `mime_type` column.

## Configuration
The migration scripts use standard SQL syntax and do not require any specific configuration. However, the database system must support JSONB data type for the `up.sql` script to work correctly.

Here's a breakdown of the configurable fields in the migration:

1. In `up.sql`:
   - `metadata JSONB NULL DEFAULT '{}'::JSONB`: This defines the new `metadata` column with the following properties:
     - Type: JSONB (JSON Binary)
     - Nullable: Yes
     - Default value: An empty JSON object

2. In `down.sql`:
   - `mime_type TEXT NULL DEFAULT NULL`: This defines the restored `mime_type` column with the following properties:
     - Type: TEXT
     - Nullable: Yes
     - Default value: NULL

## Side Effects
Applying this migration will have the following side effects:

1. When applying the "up" migration:
   - Any existing data in the `mime_type` column will be permanently lost.
   - Applications or queries that rely on the `mime_type` column will need to be updated to use the new `metadata` column.
   - The table structure will change, potentially affecting the performance of queries and the size of the table.

2. When applying the "down" migration:
   - All data stored in the `metadata` column will be permanently lost.
   - The newly added `mime_type` column will be empty (NULL values) and won't contain any data from before the "up" migration was applied.
   - Applications that were updated to use the `metadata` column will need to be reverted to use the `mime_type` column again.

## Performance Considerations
1. Adding the JSONB column may slightly increase the table size and affect insert/update performance, especially for large tables.
2. Removing the `mime_type` column will slightly reduce the table's storage requirements.
3. Queries that previously used the `mime_type` column might need to be rewritten to use JSONB operators, which could affect query performance.
4. Depending on the size of the `files` table and the database system being used, these migrations could potentially be time-consuming operations, especially if the table contains a large number of rows.
5. Some database systems may require a table rewrite when adding or removing columns, which can be a resource-intensive operation for large tables.

It's recommended to test these migrations on a staging environment with a representative dataset to assess their impact on performance and ensure that all dependent applications and queries are updated accordingly.
