## High-level description
This SQL migration script is designed to revert the changes made in the corresponding `up.sql` file. It removes the `metadata` column from the `files` table and reintroduces the `mime_type` column.

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE files DROP COLUMN metadata;
#### Description
This SQL statement removes the `metadata` column from the `files` table.

#### Internal Logic
The `ALTER TABLE` command is used to modify the structure of the `files` table. The `DROP COLUMN` clause specifies that the `metadata` column should be removed entirely from the table.

### ALTER TABLE files ADD COLUMN mime_type TEXT NULL DEFAULT NULL;
#### Description
This SQL statement adds a new column named `mime_type` to the `files` table.

#### Internal Logic
The `ALTER TABLE` command is again used to modify the `files` table. The `ADD COLUMN` clause is used to create a new column with the following specifications:
- Column name: `mime_type`
- Data type: `TEXT`
- Nullable: `NULL` (can contain null values)
- Default value: `NULL`

## Side Effects
- The `metadata` column and all its data will be permanently removed from the `files` table.
- A new `mime_type` column will be added to the `files` table, initially populated with `NULL` values.
- Any applications or queries that relied on the `metadata` column will no longer function correctly after this migration.
- Applications that previously used the `mime_type` column will be able to do so again, but the column will not contain any data from before the `up` migration was applied.

## Performance Considerations
Depending on the size of the `files` table and the database system being used, this migration could potentially be a time-consuming operation, especially if the table contains a large number of rows. The removal of a column and addition of a new one may require a table rewrite in some database systems.
