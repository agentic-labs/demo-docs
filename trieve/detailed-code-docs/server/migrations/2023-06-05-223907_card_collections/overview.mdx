## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration files for creating and managing a `card_collection` table in a database. The migration is dated 2023-06-05 and is likely part of a larger application that deals with card collections, possibly in a gaming or collectibles context.

## What does it do?
These migration files set up and tear down a database table structure for storing information about card collections. The `up.sql` file creates a new table called `card_collection` with fields to store details such as the collection's unique identifier, author, name, visibility status, description, and timestamps for creation and updates. The `down.sql` file provides a way to undo these changes by dropping the table if it exists.

This structure allows the application to:
1. Create new card collections
2. Associate collections with specific users (authors)
3. Set collections as public or private
4. Add descriptions to collections
5. Track when collections are created and updated

The migration system provides a way to version control database schema changes, making it easier to manage database evolution over time and across different environments.

## Key Files

### up.sql
This file contains the SQL commands to create the `card_collection` table. Here's a breakdown of the table structure:

```sql
CREATE TABLE card_collection (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    author_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    is_public BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE,
    description TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

- `id`: A UUID serving as the primary key
- `author_id`: A UUID linking to the `users` table, establishing ownership of the collection
- `name`: The name of the collection
- `is_public`: A boolean flag to set the collection's visibility (default is private)
- `description`: An optional text field for collection details
- `created_at` and `updated_at`: Timestamps for tracking the collection's lifecycle

### down.sql
This file contains a single SQL command to drop the `card_collection` table:

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS card_collection;
```

This command allows for easy rollback of the migration if needed.

## Dependencies
The migration files indicate a dependency on:
1. A PostgreSQL database (evidenced by the use of UUID data type)
2. A pre-existing `users` table (referenced in the foreign key constraint)
3. A database migration system (likely Diesel for Rust, based on the file structure and naming conventions)

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files in this directory, the migration files themselves serve as a form of configuration for the database schema. Key configurable aspects include:

1. Table name: `card_collection`
2. Default visibility: Collections are private by default (`is_public` defaults to `FALSE`)
3. Timestamp defaults: Both `created_at` and `updated_at` use `NOW()` as the default value

Developers working with this codebase should be aware that changing these migration files could have significant impacts on the application's data structure and should be done with caution, especially in production environments.
