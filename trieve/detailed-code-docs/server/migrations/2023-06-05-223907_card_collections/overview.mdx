## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for creating and managing the `card_collection` table in the database. The migration is dated 2023-06-05 and is identified by the timestamp 223907. It consists of two files: `up.sql` for applying the migration and `down.sql` for rolling it back.

## What does it do?
These migration scripts handle the creation and deletion of a `card_collection` table in the database. This table is designed to store information about collections of cards, which could be part of a card-based application or game. 

The `up.sql` script creates the `card_collection` table with fields for:
- A unique identifier
- The author (user) who created the collection
- The name and description of the collection
- A privacy setting (public or private)
- Timestamps for creation and last update

The `down.sql` script provides a way to undo this change by dropping the `card_collection` table if it exists.

These scripts allow developers to manage database schema changes in a controlled and reversible manner, which is crucial for maintaining database integrity across different environments and versions of the application.

## Key Files

1. `up.sql`:
   This file contains the SQL commands to create the `card_collection` table. It defines the structure of the table, including all necessary columns and constraints. Here's a breakdown of the table structure:

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE card_collection (
     id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
     author_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
     name TEXT NOT NULL,
     is_public BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
     description TEXT NOT NULL,
     created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
     updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
   );
   ```

   The table includes:
   - A UUID primary key for unique identification
   - A foreign key `author_id` linking to the `users` table
   - A non-nullable `name` and `description`
   - An `is_public` boolean flag defaulting to false
   - Timestamps for creation and last update, both defaulting to the current time

2. `down.sql`:
   This file contains the SQL command to remove the `card_collection` table:

   ```sql
   DROP TABLE IF EXISTS card_collection;
   ```

   This command will drop the `card_collection` table if it exists, effectively undoing the changes made by the `up.sql` script.

These files work together to provide a reversible database migration. The `up.sql` script applies the changes to create the new table structure, while the `down.sql` script allows for rolling back these changes if needed.

## Configuration
This migration doesn't require any specific configuration. However, it's important to note that the migration system (likely Diesel, based on the file naming convention) will use these files to manage the database schema. The timestamp in the directory name (2023-06-05-223907) is used to order migrations and ensure they are applied in the correct sequence.

When running migrations, the system will execute the `up.sql` script to apply the changes. If a rollback is needed, it will execute the `down.sql` script to revert the changes.

It's crucial to ensure that the database user executing these migrations has the necessary permissions to create and drop tables in the target database.
