title: "down.sql"

## High-level description
This SQL migration file is designed to undo the changes made by the corresponding `up.sql` file. It drops the `card_collection` table if it exists in the database.

## Symbols

### `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS card_collection;`
#### Description
This SQL command is used to remove the `card_collection` table from the database schema.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `IF EXISTS` clause is used to prevent errors if the table doesn't exist.
2. If the table exists, it will be completely removed from the database, including all its data and structure.

## Side Effects
- If the `card_collection` table exists, it will be permanently deleted from the database, along with all its contents.
- If the table doesn't exist, the command will have no effect on the database.

## Dependencies
This migration file is likely part of a database migration system, possibly using tools like Diesel for Rust or other similar ORM/migration tools.

## Error Handling
The `IF EXISTS` clause provides a basic form of error handling by preventing the command from failing if the table doesn't exist.

## TODOs
The comment at the top of the file ("This file should undo anything in `up.sql`") suggests that this file is intended to reverse the operations performed in a corresponding `up.sql` file. Developers should ensure that this down migration accurately undoes all changes made in the associated up migration.
