## High-level description
This SQL script handles the database migration rollback for removing the `card_collection` table. It ensures that the database schema returns to its previous state before the migration in `up.sql` was applied.

## Symbols

### `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS card_collection`
#### Description
This SQL statement attempts to drop the `card_collection` table if it exists. The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the statement executes successfully even if the table doesn't exist, preventing potential errors.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Check for existence:** The database checks if a table named `card_collection` exists.
2. **Conditional drop:**
   - If the table exists, the `DROP TABLE` command removes the table and all its data.
   - If the table doesn't exist, the statement completes without any action.

#### Side Effects
- **Data loss:** If the `card_collection` table exists, this statement will permanently delete the table and all its contents.
