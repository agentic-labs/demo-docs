## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration files for adding and removing a 'role' column to the 'user_api_key' table in the database schema. The migration is dated 2024-01-25 and is specifically for implementing API key roles.

## What does it do?
These migration files modify the database structure to support role-based API keys. The 'up' migration adds a new 'role' column to the 'user_api_key' table, allowing each API key to be associated with a specific role. The 'down' migration removes this column, reverting the database to its previous state without role information for API keys.

The 'role' is represented as an integer, with a default value of 0. This suggests a system where different numeric values correspond to different levels of access or permissions for API keys.

## Key Files
1. up.sql
   - This file contains the SQL command to add the 'role' column to the 'user_api_key' table.
   - It defines the column as an integer, not allowing null values, and sets a default value of 0.

2. down.sql
   - This file contains the SQL command to remove the 'role' column from the 'user_api_key' table.
   - It's designed to revert the changes made by the 'up' migration.

## Configuration
The migration uses SQL commands and doesn't require additional configuration. However, the choice of integer type for the 'role' column and the default value of 0 are important configuration decisions:

- Integer type: Allows for numerous distinct roles to be defined.
- Default value 0: Suggests that 0 might represent a default or basic role, with other integers potentially representing higher privilege levels.

## Dependencies
This migration depends on:

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| user_api_key table | The existing table that is being modified to include the new 'role' column |

## Performance Considerations
- Adding or removing a column can be a relatively fast operation, but the impact depends on the size of the 'user_api_key' table and the specific database system in use.
- For large tables, these operations might require a table rewrite, potentially causing a temporary lock and impacting database performance during migration.
- It's recommended to run these migrations during low-traffic periods or maintenance windows to minimize disruption.

## Error Handling
- The 'up' migration might fail if the 'role' column already exists in the 'user_api_key' table.
- The 'down' migration might fail if the 'role' column doesn't exist when trying to remove it.
- Specific error messages and behaviors may vary depending on the database management system being used.

## Code Snippets

### up.sql
```sql
ALTER TABLE user_api_key ADD COLUMN role integer NOT NULL DEFAULT 0;
```

### down.sql
```sql
ALTER TABLE user_api_key DROP COLUMN role;
```

These SQL commands demonstrate the straightforward nature of the migration, focusing solely on the addition and removal of the 'role' column.
