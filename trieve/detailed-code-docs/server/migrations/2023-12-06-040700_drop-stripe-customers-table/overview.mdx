## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for dropping the `stripe_customers` table from the database. It includes both the "up" migration to remove the table and the "down" migration to recreate it if needed. These migrations are part of a database schema change, likely related to refactoring how Stripe customer data is handled within the application.

## What does it do?
The migration scripts in this directory perform the following actions:

1. The "up" migration (in `up.sql`) removes the `stripe_customers` table from the database. This action deletes all Stripe customer data stored in this table.

2. The "down" migration (in `down.sql`) provides a way to revert the change by recreating the `stripe_customers` table with its original structure. This table stores information about Stripe customers, including their unique identifier, Stripe ID, email address, and timestamps for creation and updates.

These migrations allow the development team to manage changes to the database schema in a controlled manner, enabling them to apply or roll back changes as needed during the development and deployment process.

## Key Files

### up.sql
This file contains the SQL command to drop the `stripe_customers` table:

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS stripe_customers;
```

This command removes the table if it exists, effectively deleting all Stripe customer data stored in the database.

### down.sql
This file contains the SQL commands to recreate the `stripe_customers` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE stripe_customers (
    id UUID NOT NULL UNIQUE PRIMARY KEY,
    stripe_id TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE DEFAULT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (email) REFERENCES users(email)
);
```

This script recreates the table with the following structure:
- `id`: A unique UUID serving as the primary key
- `stripe_id`: A unique text field for storing Stripe-specific customer IDs
- `email`: A varchar field for storing customer email addresses, linked to the `users` table
- `created_at` and `updated_at`: Timestamp fields for tracking record creation and updates
- A foreign key constraint linking the `email` field to the `users` table

## Configuration
The migration scripts don't require any specific configuration. However, they assume the existence of a `users` table in the database, as the `stripe_customers` table has a foreign key reference to the `users` table's `email` column.

## Side Effects
Executing these migrations will have the following side effects:

1. Running the "up" migration will permanently delete the `stripe_customers` table and all its data. This action cannot be undone unless you have a backup or run the "down" migration.

2. The removal of the `stripe_customers` table may impact other parts of the application that rely on this data. Ensure that all dependent code is updated accordingly.

3. Running the "down" migration will recreate the `stripe_customers` table, but it will not restore any data that was previously in the table before it was dropped.

4. The foreign key constraint in the "down" migration ensures data integrity by linking customer emails to the `users` table. This may prevent the insertion of Stripe customer records if corresponding user records don't exist.

## Performance Considerations
- Dropping a table is generally a fast operation, but it can be time-consuming for very large tables. Consider the potential impact on database performance when running this migration, especially in production environments.
- Recreating the table in the "down" migration is typically quick, but adding indexes or constraints on a large dataset can take time.

When applying these migrations, it's crucial to have a solid backup strategy and to thoroughly test the changes in a non-production environment before deploying to production. Additionally, consider the impact on application functionality and data integrity when removing the `stripe_customers` table, and ensure that any dependent systems or processes are updated accordingly.
