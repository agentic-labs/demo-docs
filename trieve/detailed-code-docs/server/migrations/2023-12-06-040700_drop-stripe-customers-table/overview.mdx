## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for dropping the `stripe_customers` table from the database. It consists of two files: `up.sql` for executing the migration and `down.sql` for reverting it. These scripts are part of a database versioning system, likely managed by a migration tool such as Diesel or similar ORM for Rust.

## What does it do?
The migration scripts in this directory perform the following actions:

1. The `up.sql` script removes the `stripe_customers` table from the database. This action suggests that the application is changing how it manages Stripe customer data, possibly moving away from storing this information directly in the database.

2. The `down.sql` script provides a way to revert the changes by recreating the `stripe_customers` table. This table stores information about Stripe customers, including their Stripe ID, email address, and timestamps for creation and updates.

These scripts allow developers to apply or revert database changes in a controlled manner, ensuring that the database schema can be consistently updated or rolled back across different environments.

## Key Files

### up.sql
This file contains the SQL command to drop the `stripe_customers` table:

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS stripe_customers;
```

The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the operation doesn't fail if the table is already absent, making the migration more robust.

### down.sql
This file contains the SQL commands to recreate the `stripe_customers` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE stripe_customers (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    stripe_id TEXT UNIQUE,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (email) REFERENCES users(email)
);
```

This script defines the structure of the `stripe_customers` table, including its columns, data types, and constraints.

## Configuration
The migration scripts don't require any external configuration. However, the naming convention of the directory (2023-12-06-040700_drop-stripe-customers-table) suggests that these migrations are part of a versioned migration system. The timestamp in the directory name (2023-12-06-040700) indicates when the migration was created, which helps in ordering and tracking database changes over time.

## Dependencies
While not explicitly stated in the provided files, these migration scripts imply a dependency on:

1. A relational database system (likely PostgreSQL, given the use of UUID and TIMESTAMP types).
2. A database migration tool or ORM (such as Diesel for Rust) that can interpret and execute these SQL scripts as part of a migration process.

The `down.sql` script also reveals a dependency on a `users` table, as it references the `email` column from that table in a foreign key constraint.

In conclusion, these migration scripts provide a mechanism for managing changes to the database schema, specifically the removal and potential recreation of a table used to store Stripe customer information. This change might be part of a larger refactoring effort in how the application interacts with Stripe or manages customer data.
