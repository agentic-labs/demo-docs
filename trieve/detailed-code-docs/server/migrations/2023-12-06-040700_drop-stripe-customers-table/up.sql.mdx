## High-level description
This SQL script defines a database migration that drops the `stripe_customers` table. This migration is likely part of a larger change to remove or refactor how Stripe customer data is handled within the application.

## Symbols

### `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS stripe_customers;`
#### Description
This SQL statement attempts to drop the table named `stripe_customers`. The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the statement executes successfully even if the table does not exist. This is a common practice in migration scripts to prevent errors when running migrations multiple times or in different environments.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Check for Existence:** The database checks if a table named `stripe_customers` exists.
2. **Conditional Drop:**
   - If the table exists, the `DROP TABLE` statement is executed, permanently deleting the table and all its data.
   - If the table does not exist, no action is taken, and the statement completes successfully.

#### Side Effects
- **Data Loss:** This operation permanently deletes the `stripe_customers` table and all associated data.
- **Dependent Objects:** Dropping the table may impact other database objects like views, triggers, or stored procedures that depend on it.

#### Performance Considerations
Dropping a large table can be a time-consuming operation. Consider the potential impact on database performance, especially in production environments.
