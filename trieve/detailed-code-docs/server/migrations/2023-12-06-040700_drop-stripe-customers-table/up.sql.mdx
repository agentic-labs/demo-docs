## High-level description
This SQL script handles the database migration to drop the `stripe_customers` table. This operation is irreversible and suggests a change in how customer data related to Stripe is managed within the application.

## Symbols

### `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS stripe_customers;`
#### Description
This SQL statement attempts to drop the table named `stripe_customers`. The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the operation doesn't fail if the table doesn't exist, making the script more robust for different database states.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Check for Existence:** The database checks if a table named `stripe_customers` exists.
2. **Conditional Drop:**
   - If the table exists, it's permanently deleted along with all its data.
   - If the table doesn't exist, the statement completes without any action.

#### Side Effects
- **Data Loss:** This operation permanently deletes the `stripe_customers` table and all associated data. This action is irreversible.
