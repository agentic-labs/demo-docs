## High-level description
This SQL script reverts a database migration by re-adding a constraint to the `card_metadata` table. This constraint enforces that if the `private` column is false, then the `qdrant_point_id` column cannot be NULL.

## Symbols

### `ALTER TABLE card_metadata`
#### Description
This statement modifies the existing `card_metadata` table by adding a constraint.

#### Internal Logic
- `ADD CONSTRAINT qdrant_point_nullable_constraint`: This adds a new constraint named `qdrant_point_nullable_constraint` to the table.
- `CHECK (private = true OR qdrant_point_id IS NOT NULL)`: This defines the rule for the constraint. It ensures that for each row in the table, either the `private` column is true or the `qdrant_point_id` column is not NULL. This effectively means that if a card is not private (`private` is false), it must have a `qdrant_point_id`.
