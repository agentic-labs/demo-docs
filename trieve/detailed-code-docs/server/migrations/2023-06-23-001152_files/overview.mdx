## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for creating and dropping a `files` table in the database. The migration is dated 2023-06-23 and is identified by the timestamp 001152. The purpose of these scripts is to manage the database schema for storing information about user-uploaded files, including their metadata and privacy settings.

## What does it do?
The migration scripts in this directory perform the following actions:

1. Create a new table: The `up.sql` script creates a new table called `files` in the database. This table is designed to store important information about files that users upload to the system. It includes details such as:
   - A unique identifier for each file
   - The user who uploaded the file
   - The original name of the file
   - The type of file (e.g., image, text document)
   - Whether the file is private or public
   - When the file was added to the system
   - When the file information was last updated

2. Remove the table: The `down.sql` script provides a way to undo the changes made by the `up.sql` script. It removes the `files` table from the database, effectively erasing all stored file information.

These scripts allow the development team to easily set up the necessary database structure for handling file uploads and to revert those changes if needed. This approach ensures that all developers and environments can maintain consistent database schemas and easily track changes over time.

## Key Files

1. `up.sql`:
   This file contains the SQL commands to create the `files` table. It defines the structure of the table, including all the columns and their data types. Here's a breakdown of the table structure:

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE files (
     id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
     user_id UUID NOT NULL,
     file_name TEXT NOT NULL,
     mime_type TEXT NOT NULL,
     private BOOLEAN NOT NULL,
     created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
     updated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
   );
   ```

   - `id`: A unique identifier for each file entry.
   - `user_id`: Links the file to a specific user in the `users` table.
   - `file_name`: Stores the original name of the uploaded file.
   - `mime_type`: Indicates the type of file (e.g., 'image/jpeg', 'text/plain').
   - `private`: A flag to determine if the file is private or public.
   - `created_at` and `updated_at`: Timestamps for tracking when the file was added and last modified.

2. `down.sql`:
   This file contains the SQL command to drop the `files` table:

   ```sql
   DROP TABLE files;
   ```

   This simple command removes the entire `files` table and all its data from the database.

The `up.sql` script is responsible for setting up the necessary database structure to support file uploads in the application. It creates a table that can store essential information about each uploaded file, including who uploaded it, what type of file it is, and whether it's private or public.

The `down.sql` script, on the other hand, provides a way to quickly remove this table if needed. This could be useful in development environments or when needing to revert changes.

Together, these files form a reversible migration, allowing developers to easily apply or undo changes to the database schema as needed during the development process.

## Configuration
This migration doesn't directly use any configuration files or environment variables. However, the database connection details (such as host, port, username, and password) would typically be configured elsewhere in the application to execute these migration scripts.

The naming convention of the directory (2023-06-23-001152_files) suggests that this migration system might be using a timestamp-based approach to order and track migrations. This convention helps ensure that migrations are applied in the correct order across different environments.
