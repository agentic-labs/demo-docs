## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for creating and dropping a `files` table in a database. The migration is dated 2023-06-23 and is identified by the timestamp 001152. The directory includes two SQL files: `up.sql` for creating the table and `down.sql` for dropping it.

## What does it do?
These migration scripts manage the lifecycle of a `files` table in the database. The `up.sql` script creates a new table to store metadata about files uploaded by users. This table includes information such as the file's unique identifier, the user who uploaded it, the file name, its MIME type, privacy setting, and timestamps for creation and last update.

The `down.sql` script, on the other hand, provides a way to undo this change by dropping the `files` table. This is useful for rolling back the database to its previous state if needed.

## Key Files

1. `up.sql`: This file contains the SQL commands to create the `files` table. It defines the structure of the table, including all necessary columns and constraints.

2. `down.sql`: This file contains the SQL command to drop the `files` table, effectively undoing the changes made by `up.sql`.

## Configuration
The migration scripts use SQL statements that are likely compatible with PostgreSQL, given the use of UUID data type and the `NOW()` function. The specific database system should be configured elsewhere in the application.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the `files` table structure as defined in `up.sql`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE files (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),
    file_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    mime_type TEXT NOT NULL,
    private BOOLEAN NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

- `id`: A UUID serving as the primary key for each file entry.
- `user_id`: A UUID referencing the `users` table, establishing ownership of the file.
- `file_name`: The original name of the uploaded file.
- `mime_type`: The MIME type of the file, indicating its format.
- `private`: A boolean flag for file privacy settings.
- `created_at`: Timestamp of file creation, automatically set to the current time.
- `updated_at`: Timestamp of last update, automatically set and updated.

The `REFERENCES users(id)` constraint on `user_id` implies the existence of a `users` table in the database schema.

The `down.sql` file contains a single command to drop the `files` table:

```sql
DROP TABLE files;
```

This command will remove the `files` table and all its data from the database, effectively reversing the migration.

These migration scripts provide a structured way to manage database schema changes, allowing for easy application of new features (via `up.sql`) and rollback of those changes if necessary (via `down.sql`). This approach supports version control of database schemas and facilitates collaborative development and deployment processes.
