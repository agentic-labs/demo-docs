## Symbols

### `files`
#### Description
This symbol represents a new SQL table that stores information about user-uploaded files.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a table definition, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a table definition, not a function.

#### Internal Logic
The table schema is defined with the following columns:

- **`id`**: A universally unique identifier (UUID) serving as the primary key for each file entry.
- **`user_id`**: A UUID referencing the `users` table, indicating the owner of the file. This column is not nullable, enforcing a relationship with the `users` table.
- **`file_name`**: A text field storing the original name of the uploaded file. This column is not nullable.
- **`mime_type`**: A text field storing the MIME type of the file (e.g., 'image/jpeg', 'text/plain'), providing information about the file's format. This column is not nullable.
- **`private`**: A boolean flag indicating whether the file is private to the owner or publicly accessible. This column is not nullable.
- **`created_at`**: A timestamp field automatically populated with the current time when a new file record is created.
- **`updated_at`**: A timestamp field automatically updated with the current time whenever the file record is modified.
