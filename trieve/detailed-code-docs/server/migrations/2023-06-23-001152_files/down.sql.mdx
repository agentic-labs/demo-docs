## Symbols
### `DROP TABLE files;`
#### Description
This SQL statement drops the "files" table from the database. This action is intended to reverse the creation of the table, effectively undoing the migration that created it.

#### Internal Logic
- **DROP TABLE**: This SQL command is used to delete a table and all its data from the database.
- **files**: This specifies the name of the table to be dropped.

#### Side Effects
- **Data Loss**: Executing this statement will permanently delete the "files" table and all the data it contains. This action is irreversible. 

#### Performance Considerations
Dropping a large table can be a time-consuming operation.
