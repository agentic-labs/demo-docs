title: "down.sql"

## High-level description
This SQL script performs a database migration that reverts a change made to the `datasets` table. It specifically removes the `organization_id` column if it exists. This suggests that the `up.sql` migration likely added this column.

## Symbols

### `ALTER TABLE datasets DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS organization_id;`
#### Description
This SQL statement removes the `organization_id` column from the `datasets` table if it exists. The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the statement executes successfully even if the column has already been removed.

#### Internal Logic
1. **`ALTER TABLE datasets`**: This clause initiates an alteration to the `datasets` table.
2. **`DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS organization_id`**: This clause specifies the alteration, instructing the database to drop the `organization_id` column. The `IF EXISTS` clause makes the operation conditional, preventing errors if the column is already absent.

#### Side Effects
- **Modifies Database Schema**: This statement directly modifies the structure of the `datasets` table by removing a column. This change is permanent and will affect how data is stored and retrieved from the table.
