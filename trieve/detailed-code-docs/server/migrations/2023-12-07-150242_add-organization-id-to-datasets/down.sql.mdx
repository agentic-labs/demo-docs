title: "down.sql"

## High-level description
This SQL script contains a database migration that reverts a change made to the `datasets` table. Specifically, it drops the `organization_id` column if it exists. This suggests that the corresponding `up.sql` migration likely added this column.

## Symbols

### `ALTER TABLE datasets DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS organization_id;`
#### Description
This SQL statement removes the `organization_id` column from the `datasets` table if the column exists. The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the statement executes successfully even if the column has already been dropped.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Check for column existence:** The database checks if a column named `organization_id` exists in the `datasets` table.
2. **Drop column (if exists):** If the column exists, it is removed from the table along with any data it contains. If the column does not exist, the statement completes without taking any action.
