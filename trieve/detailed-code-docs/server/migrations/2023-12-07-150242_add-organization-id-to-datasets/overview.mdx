## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for modifying the `datasets` table in a database schema. The migration adds an `organization_id` column to the `datasets` table, establishing a relationship between datasets and organizations. The directory includes both "up" and "down" migration scripts, allowing for the application and reversal of these changes.

## What does it do?
The migration scripts in this directory perform the following actions:

1. Add a new column called `organization_id` to the `datasets` table.
2. Update existing datasets to associate them with a default organization.
3. Establish a foreign key relationship between the `datasets` and `organizations` tables.
4. Provide a way to undo these changes if needed.

These changes allow each dataset to be associated with a specific organization, which can be useful for organizing and managing datasets within the context of different organizations or groups.

## Key Files

### up.sql
This file contains the SQL commands to apply the migration:

1. It adds the `organization_id` column to the `datasets` table:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE datasets ADD COLUMN organization_id UUID DEFAULT NULL;
   ```

2. It updates existing datasets to associate them with a default organization:
   ```sql
   UPDATE datasets SET organization_id = (SELECT id FROM organizations WHERE name = 'DEFAULT');
   ```

3. It sets the `organization_id` column to not allow NULL values:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE datasets ALTER COLUMN organization_id SET NOT NULL;
   ```

4. Finally, it adds a foreign key constraint to ensure referential integrity:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE datasets ADD CONSTRAINT datasets_organization_id_fkey FOREIGN KEY (organization_id) REFERENCES organizations(id);
   ```

### down.sql
This file contains the SQL command to revert the migration:

```sql
ALTER TABLE datasets DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS organization_id;
```

This command removes the `organization_id` column from the `datasets` table if it exists, effectively undoing the changes made by the `up.sql` script.

## Dependencies
This migration relies on the existence of an `organizations` table in the database schema. Specifically, it assumes there is an organization with the name 'DEFAULT' in the `organizations` table.

## Configuration
The migration scripts do not require any external configuration. However, they assume a specific database structure:

1. The existence of a `datasets` table.
2. The existence of an `organizations` table with columns `id` (of type UUID) and `name`.
3. The presence of an organization named 'DEFAULT' in the `organizations` table.

It's important to ensure these prerequisites are met before applying the migration.

In conclusion, this migration enhances the data model by creating a direct relationship between datasets and organizations, allowing for better organization and management of datasets within the system.
