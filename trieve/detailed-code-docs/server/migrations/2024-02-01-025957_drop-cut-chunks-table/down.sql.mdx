## High-level description
This SQL script defines the "down" migration for reverting a database schema change. It specifically recreates the `cut_chunks` table which was likely dropped in the corresponding `up.sql` migration file.

## Symbols

### `CREATE TABLE cut_chunks`
#### Description
This SQL statement recreates the `cut_chunks` table, defining its columns and constraints. This action is typically part of a database migration rollback.

#### Internal Logic
The statement defines the following columns for the `cut_chunks` table:

- `id`: A UUID acting as the primary key for uniquely identifying each chunk.
- `user_id`: A UUID referencing the `users` table, indicating which user the chunk belongs to. This column is not nullable.
- `cut_card_content`: A TEXT field storing the actual content of the cut chunk. This column is not nullable.
- `created_at`: A TIMESTAMP field recording when the chunk was created. It defaults to the current timestamp.
- `updated_at`: A TIMESTAMP field recording when the chunk was last updated. It also defaults to the current timestamp.

The `REFERENCES users (id)` clause establishes a foreign key constraint, ensuring that every `user_id` in the `cut_chunks` table corresponds to a valid `id` in the `users` table.
