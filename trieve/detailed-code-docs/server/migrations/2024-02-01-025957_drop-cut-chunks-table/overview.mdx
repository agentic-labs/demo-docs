## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for dropping the `cut_chunks` table from the database schema. It consists of two files: `up.sql` for applying the change (dropping the table) and `down.sql` for reverting the change (recreating the table).

## What does it do?
The migration scripts in this directory perform the following actions:

1. The `up.sql` script removes the `cut_chunks` table from the database. This action deletes all data stored in the table and removes its structure from the database schema.

2. The `down.sql` script recreates the `cut_chunks` table with its original structure. This table is designed to store information about cut cards associated with users, including when they were created and last updated.

These scripts allow for version control of the database schema, enabling developers to apply or revert changes to the database structure in a controlled manner.

## Key Files

### up.sql
This file contains the SQL command to drop the `cut_chunks` table:

```sql
-- Your SQL goes here
DROP TABLE cut_chunks;
```

When executed, this script will permanently remove the `cut_chunks` table and all its data from the database.

### down.sql
This file contains the SQL command to recreate the `cut_chunks` table:

```sql
-- This file should undo anything in `up.sql`
CREATE TABLE cut_chunks (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),
    cut_card_content TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

This script recreates the `cut_chunks` table with the following structure:
- `id`: A UUID serving as the primary key
- `user_id`: A UUID referencing the `users` table
- `cut_card_content`: A TEXT field for storing the content of the cut card
- `created_at` and `updated_at`: TIMESTAMP fields for tracking creation and update times

## Dependencies
The `cut_chunks` table has a dependency on the `users` table, as indicated by the foreign key relationship established through the `user_id` column.

## Configuration
These migration scripts do not require any specific configuration. They are typically executed by a database migration tool or framework that manages the order and application of migrations.

## Notes
1. The use of UUIDs for `id` and `user_id` suggests a distributed or high-volume system where unique identifiers across multiple instances or large datasets are necessary.
2. The `NOT NULL` constraints on `user_id` and `cut_card_content` ensure data integrity by requiring values for these fields when inserting records.
3. The `DEFAULT NOW()` for `created_at` and `updated_at` automatically sets these timestamps when a record is inserted or updated.
4. Dropping a table is generally a fast operation, but it can impact system performance for very large tables or busy database systems.
5. The `up.sql` script does not include explicit error handling. If the `cut_chunks` table doesn't exist when the script is run, it may result in an SQL error.
6. The comment "-- Your SQL goes here" in `up.sql` suggests that this might be a template or placeholder for migration scripts. Consider removing this comment in the final version of the migration script for cleaner code.
