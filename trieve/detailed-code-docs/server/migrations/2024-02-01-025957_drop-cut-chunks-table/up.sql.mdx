## High-level description
This SQL migration script is designed to remove the `cut_chunks` table from the database schema. It's a simple, straightforward operation that drops the entire table.

## Symbols

### DROP TABLE cut_chunks;
#### Description
This SQL command is used to completely remove the `cut_chunks` table from the database.

#### Internal Logic
The `DROP TABLE` statement is a Data Definition Language (DDL) command that deletes a table and all its data from the database. When executed, it will:
1. Remove all rows in the table
2. Delete the table structure from the database schema
3. Free up the storage space previously occupied by the table

## Side Effects
- All data stored in the `cut_chunks` table will be permanently deleted.
- Any database objects (like indexes, triggers, or foreign keys) associated with the `cut_chunks` table will also be removed.
- Queries or applications that depend on the `cut_chunks` table will fail after this migration is applied.

## Performance Considerations
Dropping a table is generally a fast operation, especially for smaller tables. However, for very large tables or in busy database systems, this operation might momentarily lock resources and could impact concurrent database operations.

## Error Handling
This script does not include explicit error handling. If the `cut_chunks` table doesn't exist when this script is run, it will likely result in an SQL error. It's assumed that the migration framework or the application running this script will handle any potential errors.

## TODOs
The comment "-- Your SQL goes here" suggests that this might be a template or placeholder for migration scripts. In this case, the actual SQL has been added below the comment. For cleaner code, you might consider removing this comment in the final version of the migration script.
