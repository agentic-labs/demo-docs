### `down.sql`
#### Description
This SQL script removes the `card_html` column from the `card_metadata` table. This action is intended to undo the addition of the column in a previous migration.

#### Internal Logic
The script uses the following SQL statement:

```sql
ALTER TABLE card_metadata
DROP COLUMN card_html;
```

This statement modifies the existing `card_metadata` table by removing the `card_html` column.
