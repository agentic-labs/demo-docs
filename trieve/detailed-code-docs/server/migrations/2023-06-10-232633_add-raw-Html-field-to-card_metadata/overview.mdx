## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for adding and removing a `card_html` column to the `card_metadata` table in a database. The migration is dated 2023-06-10 and is identified by the timestamp 232633. The purpose of these scripts is to manage database schema changes in a version-controlled manner, allowing for easy application and rollback of database modifications.

## What does it do?
These migration scripts modify the structure of the `card_metadata` table in the database. The "up" migration adds a new column called `card_html` to store HTML content related to cards, while the "down" migration removes this column. This allows the application to store raw HTML associated with card metadata, which could be used for rendering or processing purposes. The ability to roll back the change ensures that the database can be reverted to its previous state if needed.

## Key Files

### up.sql
This file contains the SQL command to add the `card_html` column to the `card_metadata` table. The command is:

```sql
ALTER TABLE card_metadata
ADD COLUMN card_html TEXT NULL;
```

This adds a new column named `card_html` with a TEXT data type, allowing it to store large amounts of text. The NULL constraint means that this field is optional and can contain empty values.

### down.sql
This file contains the SQL command to remove the `card_html` column from the `card_metadata` table. The command is:

```sql
ALTER TABLE card_metadata
DROP COLUMN card_html;
```

This removes the `card_html` column, effectively undoing the change made by the up.sql script.

## Configuration
The migration is identified by its timestamp in the directory name: 2023-06-10-232633. This naming convention is likely used by a migration tool to determine the order in which migrations should be applied or rolled back.
