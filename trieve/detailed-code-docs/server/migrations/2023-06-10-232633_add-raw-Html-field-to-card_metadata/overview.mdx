## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for adding a new `card_html` column to the `card_metadata` table in the database. The migration is dated 2023-06-10 and includes both "up" and "down" scripts for applying and reverting the change, respectively.

## What does it do?
These scripts modify the database structure by adding a new column to store HTML content related to cards. The "up" script adds the column, allowing the application to store raw HTML data for each card. The "down" script removes this column, effectively undoing the change if needed. This allows for flexible management of the database schema, enabling easy updates and rollbacks as the application evolves.

## Key Files

1. `up.sql`:
   - This file contains the SQL command to add the `card_html` column to the `card_metadata` table.
   - The new column is defined as `TEXT` type and allows NULL values.
   - Example:
     ```sql
     ALTER TABLE card_metadata
     ADD COLUMN card_html TEXT NULL;
     ```

2. `down.sql`:
   - This file contains the SQL command to remove the `card_html` column from the `card_metadata` table.
   - It's used to revert the changes made by the `up.sql` script.
   - Example:
     ```sql
     ALTER TABLE card_metadata
     DROP COLUMN card_html;
     ```
