## High-level description
This SQL migration file is designed to revert the changes made in the corresponding `up.sql` file. It removes the `registerable` column from the `orgs` table if it exists.

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE orgs DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS registerable;
#### Description
This SQL statement removes the `registerable` column from the `orgs` table, but only if the column exists. This is a defensive approach to ensure that the migration can be run safely even if the column has already been removed or never existed.

#### Internal Logic
1. The statement targets the `orgs` table.
2. It attempts to drop the `registerable` column.
3. The `IF EXISTS` clause prevents an error from occurring if the column doesn't exist.

## Side Effects
- If the `registerable` column exists in the `orgs` table, it will be permanently removed along with all its data.
- If the column doesn't exist, the statement will have no effect on the table structure.

## Performance Considerations
This operation may temporarily lock the `orgs` table during the column removal process. The impact should be minimal for small to medium-sized tables, but for large tables with many concurrent operations, it might cause a brief interruption in write access to the table.

## Error Handling
The `IF EXISTS` clause provides a basic form of error handling by preventing the statement from failing if the column doesn't exist. This makes the migration more robust and idempotent, allowing it to be run multiple times without error.
