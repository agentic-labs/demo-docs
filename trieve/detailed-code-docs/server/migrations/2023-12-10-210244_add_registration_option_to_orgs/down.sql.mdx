## High-level description
This SQL migration file is designed to revert the changes made in the corresponding `up.sql` file. It removes the `registerable` column from the `orgs` table if it exists.

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE orgs DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS registerable;
#### Description
This SQL statement removes the `registerable` column from the `orgs` table, but only if the column exists. This is a defensive approach to ensure that the migration can be run safely even if the column has already been removed or never existed.

#### Internal Logic
1. The statement targets the `orgs` table.
2. It attempts to drop the `registerable` column.
3. The `IF EXISTS` clause prevents an error from occurring if the column doesn't exist.

## Side Effects
- If the `registerable` column exists in the `orgs` table, it will be permanently removed along with all its data.
- If the column doesn't exist, the statement will have no effect on the table structure.

## Performance Considerations
This operation may temporarily lock the `orgs` table during the column removal process. The impact should be minimal for small to medium-sized tables, but for large tables with many concurrent operations, it might cause a brief interruption in write access to the table.

## TODOs
The comment at the top of the file suggests that this script should undo anything done in the corresponding `up.sql` file. It's important to ensure that this down migration completely and correctly reverts all changes made by the up migration.
