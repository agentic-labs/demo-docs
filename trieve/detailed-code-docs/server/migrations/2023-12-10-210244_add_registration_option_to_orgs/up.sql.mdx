## High-level description
This SQL migration file adds a new column called `registerable` to the `organizations` table. The column is of type BOOLEAN and has a default value of TRUE.

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE organizations
#### Description
This SQL command modifies the structure of the existing `organizations` table by adding a new column.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `ALTER TABLE` statement is used to modify the `organizations` table.
2. The `ADD COLUMN` clause specifies that a new column is being added to the table.
3. The new column is named `registerable`.
4. The data type of the column is set to `BOOLEAN`.
5. A `DEFAULT` constraint is added, setting the default value of this column to `TRUE`.

## Side Effects
- This migration will modify the schema of the `organizations` table in the database.
- All existing rows in the `organizations` table will have the `registerable` column added with a default value of `TRUE`.
- Any future inserts into the `organizations` table that do not specify a value for `registerable` will automatically use the default value of `TRUE`.

## Performance Considerations
- Depending on the size of the `organizations` table and the database system being used, this operation might lock the table for a brief period while the column is being added.
- For large tables, it's recommended to run this migration during a maintenance window or low-traffic period to minimize potential disruptions.

## TODOs
The comment "-- Your SQL goes here" at the top of the file suggests that this might be a template or placeholder for SQL migrations. In a production environment, it's recommended to remove or replace such comments with more specific documentation about the purpose of this particular migration.
