## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for fixing events upload functionality. It includes two files: `up.sql` and `down.sql`, which are responsible for applying and reverting changes to the database schema and functions related to dataset event counting.

## What does it do?
The migration scripts in this directory perform the following tasks:

1. Rename the `dataset_notification_counts` table to `dataset_event_counts`, indicating a shift from tracking notifications to a broader concept of events related to datasets.

2. Create or replace a function called `update_notification_count()` that automatically updates the `dataset_event_counts` table when notifications are inserted or deleted. This function acts as a trigger to maintain an accurate count of events for each dataset.

3. Provide a way to revert these changes if needed, by renaming the table back to its original name and dropping the created function.

These changes improve the system's ability to track and manage events related to datasets, potentially enhancing reporting and analytics capabilities.

## Key Files

### up.sql
This file contains the SQL statements to apply the migration:

1. Renames the `dataset_notification_counts` table to `dataset_event_counts`:

```sql
ALTER TABLE dataset_notification_counts RENAME TO dataset_event_counts;
```

2. Creates or replaces the `update_notification_count()` function:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.update_notification_count()
 RETURNS trigger
 LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $function$
BEGIN
    IF (TG_OP = 'INSERT') THEN
        INSERT INTO dataset_event_counts (dataset_uuid, notification_count)
        VALUES (NEW.dataset_uuid, 1)
        ON CONFLICT (dataset_uuid)
        DO UPDATE SET notification_count = dataset_event_counts.notification_count + 1;
    ELSIF (TG_OP = 'DELETE') THEN
        UPDATE dataset_event_counts
        SET notification_count = notification_count - 1
        WHERE dataset_uuid = OLD.dataset_uuid;
    END IF;
    RETURN NEW;
END;
$function$
```

This function is designed to be used as a trigger, automatically updating the `dataset_event_counts` table when notifications are inserted or deleted.

### down.sql
This file contains the SQL statements to revert the migration:

1. Drops the `update_notification_count()` function:

```sql
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS public.update_notification_count() CASCADE;
```

2. Renames the `dataset_event_counts` table back to `dataset_notification_counts`:

```sql
ALTER TABLE dataset_event_counts RENAME TO dataset_notification_counts;
```

## Dependencies
This migration relies on PostgreSQL's built-in functionality for table alterations, function creation, and trigger management. No external libraries or frameworks are used.

## Configuration
There are no specific configuration files or environment variables used in this migration. The migration is designed to be run as part of a database migration process, likely managed by an ORM or migration tool in the larger application context.

The migration assumes the existence of a `dataset_notification_counts` table before applying the changes and a `dataset_event_counts` table when reverting the changes. It also assumes that the application has the necessary permissions to create and modify tables and functions in the database.
