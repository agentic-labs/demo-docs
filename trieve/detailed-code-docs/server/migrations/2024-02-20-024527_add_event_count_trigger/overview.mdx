## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for adding an event count trigger to a database. The migration is designed to automatically update a notification count whenever changes occur in the `public.events` table. The directory includes two SQL files: `up.sql` for applying the migration and `down.sql` for reverting it.

## What does it do?
The migration scripts in this directory set up an automatic system to keep track of event-related notifications in a database. Here's a simplified explanation of what it does:

1. When the migration is applied (`up.sql`):
   - It creates a trigger called `update_event_count` on the `public.events` table.
   - This trigger activates whenever a row is inserted, deleted, or updated in the events table.
   - Each time the trigger activates, it calls a function named `update_notification_count()`.
   - This function (defined elsewhere) likely updates a counter or performs some calculations based on the changes in the events table.

2. When the migration is reverted (`down.sql`):
   - It removes the `update_event_count` trigger from the `public.events` table.
   - This effectively stops the automatic updating of the notification count when changes occur in the events table.

The purpose of this setup is to maintain an up-to-date count or summary of events, which could be used for displaying notifications, generating reports, or other features that rely on knowing the current state of events in the system.

## Key Files

1. `up.sql`:
   This file contains the SQL commands to create the `update_event_count` trigger. Here's the content of the file:

   ```sql
   create trigger update_event_count
   after insert or delete or update on public.events
   for each row
   execute function update_notification_count();
   ```

   This script creates a trigger that fires after any insert, delete, or update operation on the `public.events` table. For each affected row, it executes the `update_notification_count()` function.

2. `down.sql`:
   This file contains the SQL command to remove the trigger created by `up.sql`. Here's the content:

   ```sql
   drop trigger if exists update_event_count on public.events;
   ```

   This script drops the `update_event_count` trigger from the `public.events` table if it exists, effectively reverting the changes made by the `up.sql` script.

## Dependencies
The migration scripts in this directory depend on:

1. The existence of a `public.events` table in the database.
2. A function named `update_notification_count()` being defined in the database. This function is called by the trigger but is not defined within these migration scripts.

## Configuration
These migration scripts do not require any specific configuration. However, they assume certain structures exist in the database:

1. A schema named `public`.
2. A table named `events` within the `public` schema.
3. A function named `update_notification_count()` that can be executed by the trigger.

It's important to ensure that these prerequisites are met before applying the migration. Additionally, database permissions should be set up to allow the creation and dropping of triggers on the `public.events` table.

In summary, this migration adds an automated mechanism to update notification counts based on changes in the events table, providing a way to maintain real-time or near-real-time event statistics in the application.
