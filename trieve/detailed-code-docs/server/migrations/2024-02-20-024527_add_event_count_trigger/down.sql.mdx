## High-level description
This SQL script reverts the database migration defined in the corresponding `up.sql` file. Specifically, it drops a trigger named `update_event_count` associated with the `public.events` table.

## Symbols

### `drop trigger if exists update_event_count on public.events;`
#### Description
This SQL statement drops the trigger named `update_event_count` on the `public.events` table if it exists. The `if exists` clause ensures that the statement executes successfully even if the trigger is not present, preventing potential errors.

#### Internal Logic
1. **`drop trigger if exists`**: This clause initiates the dropping of a trigger only if it already exists in the database.
2. **`update_event_count`**: This is the name of the trigger to be dropped.
3. **`on public.events`**: This specifies that the trigger named `update_event_count` is associated with the `events` table within the `public` schema.

#### Side Effects
- **Removal of Trigger**: This statement removes the `update_event_count` trigger from the database. Consequently, any actions previously associated with the trigger will no longer be executed when changes occur on the `public.events` table.
