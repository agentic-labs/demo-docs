## High-level description
This SQL script creates a trigger named `update_event_count` on the `public.events` table. The trigger is designed to automatically execute the `update_notification_count()` function after insert, delete, or update operations on the events table.

## Symbols

### `update_event_count` Trigger
#### Description
This trigger is responsible for maintaining the event count, presumably for notification purposes. It fires after insert, delete, or update operations on the `public.events` table.

#### Internal Logic
1. The trigger is set to fire for each row affected by the specified operations (insert, delete, or update).
2. When triggered, it executes the `update_notification_count()` function.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `update_notification_count()` function | This function is called by the trigger to update the notification count. Its implementation is not provided in this file. |
| `public.events` table | This is the table on which the trigger is defined. |

## Notes
1. The `create or replace` clause ensures that if a trigger with the same name already exists, it will be replaced by this new definition.
2. The trigger is defined at the row level (`for each row`), meaning it will fire once for each row affected by the triggering operation.
3. The actual logic for updating the notification count is encapsulated in the `update_notification_count()` function, which is not defined in this file.
4. This trigger will fire for all insert, delete, and update operations on the `public.events` table, regardless of which columns are affected.

## TODOs
- Ensure that the `update_notification_count()` function is properly defined and can handle the context provided by the trigger (e.g., NEW and OLD row data for insert, update, and delete operations).
- Consider adding error handling within the `update_notification_count()` function to prevent trigger failures from causing transaction rollbacks.
- If performance becomes an issue, consider optimizing by only firing the trigger for specific column updates or using statement-level triggers if appropriate.
