## High-level description
This SQL script creates an index on the `vote` column of the `card_votes` table. This is intended to improve the performance of queries that filter or sort by the `vote` column. 

## Symbols

### `CREATE INDEX idx_card_votes_vote ON card_votes(vote);`
#### Description
This SQL statement creates an index named `idx_card_votes_vote` on the `vote` column of the `card_votes` table. 

#### Internal Logic
* `CREATE INDEX` is a SQL command used to create an index.
* `idx_card_votes_vote` is the name given to the new index.
* `ON card_votes(vote)` specifies that the index is created on the `vote` column of the `card_votes` table.

#### Performance Considerations
Creating an index on a column can significantly speed up queries that filter or sort by that column. However, it's important to note that indexes also consume storage space and can slightly slow down write operations (like inserts, updates, and deletes). Therefore, it's crucial to carefully consider the trade-offs before creating an index.
