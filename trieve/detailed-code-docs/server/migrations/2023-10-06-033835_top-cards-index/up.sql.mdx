## High-level description
This SQL migration file creates an index on the `vote` column of the `card_votes` table. The purpose of this index is to improve query performance for operations that involve filtering or sorting based on the `vote` column in the `card_votes` table.

## Symbols

### CREATE INDEX idx_card_votes_vote ON card_votes(vote);
#### Description
This SQL statement creates a new index named `idx_card_votes_vote` on the `card_votes` table, specifically on the `vote` column.

#### Internal Logic
1. The database engine creates a new index structure.
2. The index is built on the `vote` column of the `card_votes` table.
3. The index is named `idx_card_votes_vote` for easy identification.

## Performance Considerations
Creating an index on the `vote` column can significantly improve the performance of queries that filter or sort by this column. However, it may slightly slow down insert, update, and delete operations on the `card_votes` table, as the index needs to be maintained. The trade-off is generally worthwhile if there are frequent queries using the `vote` column in WHERE clauses or ORDER BY statements.

## Dependencies
This migration assumes the existence of a `card_votes` table with a `vote` column. The exact structure of the `card_votes` table is not provided in this file, but it's a prerequisite for this migration to succeed.
