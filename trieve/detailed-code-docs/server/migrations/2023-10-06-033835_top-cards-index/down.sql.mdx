## High-level description
This SQL migration file is designed to undo the changes made in the corresponding `up.sql` file. Specifically, it drops an index named `idx_card_votes_vote` from the database.

## Symbols

### DROP INDEX idx_card_votes_vote
#### Description
This SQL command removes the index named `idx_card_votes_vote` from the database.

#### Internal Logic
The `DROP INDEX` statement is used to delete an existing index in a database. In this case, it's removing an index that was likely created to improve query performance on the `vote` column of the `card_votes` table.

## Side Effects
Dropping this index may have the following side effects:
1. Decreased query performance: Queries that previously utilized this index for faster data retrieval might become slower.
2. Reduced database size: Removing the index will free up some storage space in the database.
3. Potential impact on existing queries: Any queries optimized to use this index may need to be re-evaluated for performance.

## Dependencies
This migration script doesn't rely on any external libraries or modules. It uses standard SQL syntax that should be compatible with most relational database management systems.

## Error Handling
This script does not include explicit error handling. If the index doesn't exist when trying to drop it, most database systems will raise an error. It's assumed that the database system or the migration tool running this script will handle such errors appropriately.

## TODOs
The comment at the top of the file, "This file should undo anything in `up.sql`", serves as a reminder and guideline for the purpose of this migration script. It ensures that this `down.sql` script reverses the changes made by the corresponding `up.sql` script, allowing for easy rollback of database changes if needed.
