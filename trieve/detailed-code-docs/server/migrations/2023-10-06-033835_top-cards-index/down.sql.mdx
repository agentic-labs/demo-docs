## High-level description
This SQL script reverts a database migration related to an index named `idx_card_votes_vote`. Specifically, it drops the index, likely as part of a rollback operation.

## Symbols

### `DROP INDEX idx_card_votes_vote;`
#### Description
This statement drops the index named `idx_card_votes_vote`. This action is typically performed to undo the creation of the index during a database migration rollback.

#### Internal Logic
- **`DROP INDEX`**: This SQL command is used to remove an existing index from a database table.
- **`idx_card_votes_vote`**: This is the name of the index being dropped. The name suggests that the index was created on a table related to card votes, possibly to improve the performance of queries involving the `vote` column. 

## Side Effects
- **Index Removal**: This script will remove the `idx_card_votes_vote` index from the database. This may lead to decreased performance for queries that relied on this index.
- **Transaction Rollback**: Depending on the database system and how the migration is executed, this script might be part of a larger transaction rollback.
