## High-level description
This SQL script creates a table named `password_resets` to store information related to password reset requests. The table is designed to manage and track password reset tokens, including their associated email addresses and expiration times.

## Symbols

### `password_resets` table
#### Description
The `password_resets` table is created to store essential information for managing password reset requests. It includes fields for unique identification, user email, expiration time, and timestamps for creation and updates.

#### Internal Logic
The table is created with the following columns:
1. `id`: A unique identifier for each password reset request.
2. `email`: The email address associated with the password reset request.
3. `expires_at`: The timestamp when the password reset token expires.
4. `created_at`: The timestamp when the password reset request was created.
5. `updated_at`: The timestamp when the password reset request was last updated.

#### Performance Considerations
The `id` column is set as the primary key and marked as unique, which should provide efficient lookups and ensure no duplicate entries.

## Dependencies
This SQL script doesn't have any external dependencies. It's a standalone SQL statement that can be executed in a PostgreSQL database.

## Configuration
The table structure defines some implicit configuration:

| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| `id` | UUID | Unique identifier for each password reset request |
| `email` | VARCHAR(100) | Email address with a maximum length of 100 characters |
| `expires_at` | TIMESTAMP | Expiration time for the password reset token |
| `created_at` | TIMESTAMP | Creation time of the password reset request |
| `updated_at` | TIMESTAMP | Last update time of the password reset request |

## Error Handling
This SQL script doesn't include explicit error handling. However, the database system will enforce the constraints defined in the table structure, such as NOT NULL constraints and the UNIQUE constraint on the `id` column.
