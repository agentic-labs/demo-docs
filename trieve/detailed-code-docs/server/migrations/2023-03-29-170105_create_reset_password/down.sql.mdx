## High-level description
This SQL script handles the database migration rollback for removing the password reset functionality. It drops the `password_resets` table from the database.

## Symbols

### `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS password_resets;`
#### Description
This SQL statement attempts to drop the `password_resets` table if it exists in the database. 

#### Internal Logic
- **`DROP TABLE`**: This command is used to delete a table from the database.
- **`IF EXISTS`**: This clause checks if the table exists before attempting to drop it. This prevents an error if the table doesn't exist.
- **`password_resets`**: This is the name of the table to be dropped.

#### Side Effects
This statement will permanently delete the `password_resets` table and all its data if it exists.
