## High-level description
This SQL script is a database migration file designed to revert the creation of the `password_resets` table. It's part of a down migration, which is typically used to undo changes made by an up migration in database version control systems.

## Symbols

### DROP TABLE IF EXISTS password_resets;
#### Description
This SQL command is used to remove the `password_resets` table from the database if it exists.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `IF EXISTS` clause is used to prevent errors if the table doesn't exist.
2. If the table exists, it will be completely removed from the database schema.
3. If the table doesn't exist, the command will have no effect and will not raise an error.

## Side Effects
- If the `password_resets` table exists, it will be permanently deleted from the database, along with all its data.
- Any dependencies on this table (e.g., foreign keys, views, or triggers) may be affected or cause the migration to fail if not handled properly.

## Error Handling
The `IF EXISTS` clause provides a basic form of error handling by preventing the script from throwing an error if the table doesn't exist.

## TODOs
The comment at the beginning of the file suggests that this might be part of a larger migration process:
```sql
-- Then, drop the password_reset_tokens table
```
This comment indicates that there might be other steps before or after this one in the complete down migration process. It's worth noting that the comment mentions "password_reset_tokens" while the actual table name in the SQL command is "password_resets". This discrepancy should be reviewed to ensure consistency between the comment and the actual table name being dropped.
