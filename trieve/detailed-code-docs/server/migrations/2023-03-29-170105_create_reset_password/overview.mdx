## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for creating and dropping a `password_resets` table in the database. The migration is related to implementing a password reset functionality for the application. The directory includes two SQL files: `up.sql` for creating the table and `down.sql` for dropping it.

## What does it do?
These migration scripts manage the database structure for handling password reset requests. When applied, they create a new table called `password_resets` that stores information about password reset requests, including the user's email, expiration time, and timestamps. If the migration needs to be rolled back, the `down.sql` script removes this table from the database.

The `password_resets` table allows the application to:
1. Store password reset requests securely
2. Associate reset requests with user emails
3. Set expiration times for reset tokens
4. Track when reset requests were created and updated

This functionality is crucial for implementing a secure password reset feature in the application, allowing users to regain access to their accounts if they forget their passwords.

## Key Files

1. `up.sql`: This file contains the SQL commands to create the `password_resets` table. It defines the table structure with the following columns:
   - `id`: A unique UUID identifier for each reset request
   - `email`: The email address of the user requesting a password reset
   - `expires_at`: A timestamp indicating when the reset request expires
   - `created_at`: A timestamp for when the reset request was created
   - `updated_at`: A timestamp for when the reset request was last updated

   Example of the table creation:

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE password_resets (
     id UUID NOT NULL UNIQUE PRIMARY KEY,
     email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
     expires_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
     created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
     updated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL
   );
   ```

2. `down.sql`: This file contains the SQL command to drop the `password_resets` table, effectively reversing the migration:

   ```sql
   DROP TABLE IF EXISTS password_resets;
   ```

   This command ensures that the table is removed if it exists, allowing for a clean rollback of the migration.

## Configuration
The migration scripts don't require any specific configuration. However, the database connection details should be properly configured in the application's database configuration file to ensure that these migrations can be applied correctly.

When implementing the password reset functionality in the application code, developers should consider the following:

1. The `expires_at` field should be set to an appropriate duration (e.g., 24 hours from creation) when inserting new reset requests.
2. The application should regularly clean up expired reset requests to maintain database efficiency.
3. The `email` field should be indexed for faster lookups if the application expects a high volume of reset requests.

By using these migration scripts, the application can manage password reset requests in a structured and secure manner, providing a robust foundation for implementing user account recovery features.
