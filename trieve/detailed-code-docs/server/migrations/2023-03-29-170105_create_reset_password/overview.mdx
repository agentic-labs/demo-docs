## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for creating and dropping a `password_resets` table in a database. The migration is part of a system for managing password reset requests, likely for a user authentication system. The directory includes two files: an "up" migration to create the table and a "down" migration to remove it.

## What does it do?
These migration scripts manage the lifecycle of a database table used for password reset functionality. When applied, they create a table that stores information about password reset requests, including:

1. A unique identifier for each request
2. The email address of the user requesting a password reset
3. An expiration time for the reset token
4. Timestamps for when the request was created and last updated

This table allows the application to securely manage password reset requests, ensuring that they are time-limited and associated with specific user emails. The "down" migration provides a way to remove this table if needed, which is useful for rolling back changes or cleaning up the database schema.

## Key Files

1. `up.sql`: This file contains the SQL commands to create the `password_resets` table. It defines the table structure with the following columns:
   - `id`: A UUID primary key
   - `email`: A VARCHAR(100) field for the user's email address
   - `expires_at`: A TIMESTAMP for the token expiration
   - `created_at`: A TIMESTAMP for the request creation time
   - `updated_at`: A TIMESTAMP for the last update time

   Example of the table creation:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE password_resets (
     id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
     email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
     expires_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
     created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
     updated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL
   );
   ```

2. `down.sql`: This file contains the SQL command to drop the `password_resets` table if it exists. It's used to revert the changes made by the up migration.

   Example of the table removal:
   ```sql
   DROP TABLE IF EXISTS password_resets;
   ```

## Configuration
The table structure in `up.sql` implicitly defines some configuration options:

| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| `id` | UUID | Unique identifier for each password reset request |
| `email` | VARCHAR(100) | Email address with a maximum length of 100 characters |
| `expires_at` | TIMESTAMP | Expiration time for the password reset token |
| `created_at` | TIMESTAMP | Creation time of the password reset request |
| `updated_at` | TIMESTAMP | Last update time of the password reset request |

These configuration options define the structure and constraints of the `password_resets` table, ensuring data integrity and providing the necessary fields for managing password reset requests.

It's worth noting that there's a discrepancy between the comment in the `down.sql` file, which mentions a "password_reset_tokens" table, and the actual table name "password_resets". This inconsistency should be reviewed and corrected to maintain clarity in the codebase.
