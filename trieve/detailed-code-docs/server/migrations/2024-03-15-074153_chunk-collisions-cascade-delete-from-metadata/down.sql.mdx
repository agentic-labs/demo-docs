## High-level description
This SQL script reverts the database migration defined in the corresponding `up.sql` file, specifically targeting the `chunk_collisions` table. It removes foreign key constraints that enforce relationships with the `chunk_metadata` table and then adds back constraints that were likely present before the migration in `up.sql`.

## Code Structure
The script consists of a series of SQL `ALTER TABLE` statements that modify the `chunk_collisions` table. Each statement either drops or adds a foreign key constraint.

## Symbols

### `ALTER TABLE chunk_collisions ...`
#### Description
This set of SQL statements modifies the existing `chunk_collisions` table to revert changes related to foreign key constraints.

#### Internal Logic
1. **`DROP CONSTRAINT chunk_collisions_card_id_fkey;`**: Removes the foreign key constraint named `chunk_collisions_card_id_fkey` from the `chunk_collisions` table. This constraint likely enforced referential integrity between `chunk_collisions` and `chunk_metadata` tables based on the `chunk_id` column.

2. **`ADD CONSTRAINT card_collisions_card_id_fkey FOREIGN KEY (chunk_id) REFERENCES chunk_metadata(id);`**: Adds a new foreign key constraint named `card_collisions_card_id_fkey` to the `chunk_collisions` table. This constraint establishes a relationship between the `chunk_id` column in `chunk_collisions` and the `id` column in `chunk_metadata`.

3. **`DROP CONSTRAINT chunk_collisions_collision_qdrant_id_fkey;`**: Removes the foreign key constraint named `chunk_collisions_collision_qdrant_id_fkey` from the `chunk_collisions` table. This constraint likely enforced referential integrity between `chunk_collisions` and `chunk_metadata` tables based on the `collision_qdrant_id` column.

4. **`ADD CONSTRAINT card_collisions_collision_qdrant_id_fkey FOREIGN KEY (collision_qdrant_id) REFERENCES chunk_metadata(qdrant_point_id);`**: Adds a new foreign key constraint named `card_collisions_collision_qdrant_id_fkey` to the `chunk_collisions` table. This constraint establishes a relationship between the `collision_qdrant_id` column in `chunk_collisions` and the `qdrant_point_id` column in `chunk_metadata`.

#### Side Effects
- Modifies the database schema by altering the `chunk_collisions` table.
- Potentially impacts data integrity if the removed constraints were ensuring valid relationships between tables.
