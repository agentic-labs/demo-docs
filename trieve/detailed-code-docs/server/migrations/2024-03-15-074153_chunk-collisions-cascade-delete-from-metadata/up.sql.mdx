## High-level description
This SQL script modifies the `chunk_collisions` table in a database. It specifically updates the foreign key constraints to establish a cascading delete and update behavior with the `chunk_metadata` table.

## Symbols
### `ALTER TABLE chunk_collisions ...`
#### Description
This set of SQL statements modifies the existing `chunk_collisions` table. It first drops existing foreign key constraints and then adds new ones with the desired cascading behavior.

#### Internal Logic
1. **`DROP CONSTRAINT card_collisions_card_id_fkey;`**: This statement removes the existing foreign key constraint named `card_collisions_card_id_fkey` from the `chunk_collisions` table. This constraint likely enforced a relationship between the `chunk_collisions` table and another table (possibly `card_collisions` or a table referencing card IDs) based on a `card_id` column.

2. **`ALTER TABLE chunk_collisions ADD CONSTRAINT chunk_collisions_card_id_fkey FOREIGN KEY (chunk_id) REFERENCES chunk_metadata(id) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE;`**: This statement adds a new foreign key constraint named `chunk_collisions_card_id_fkey` to the `chunk_collisions` table. 
    - This constraint establishes a relationship between the `chunk_id` column in the `chunk_collisions` table and the `id` column in the `chunk_metadata` table. 
    - The `ON DELETE CASCADE` and `ON UPDATE CASCADE` clauses ensure that if a record in the `chunk_metadata` table is deleted or updated (and its `id` changes), any corresponding records in the `chunk_collisions` table referencing that `id` will also be automatically deleted or updated accordingly.

3. **`DROP CONSTRAINT card_collisions_collision_qdrant_id_fkey;`**: This statement removes the existing foreign key constraint named `card_collisions_collision_qdrant_id_fkey` from the `chunk_collisions` table. This constraint likely enforced a relationship between the `chunk_collisions` table and another table (possibly `card_collisions` or a table referencing card IDs) based on a `collision_qdrant_id` column.

4. **`ALTER TABLE chunk_collisions ADD CONSTRAINT chunk_collisions_collision_qdrant_id_fkey FOREIGN KEY (collision_qdrant_id) REFERENCES chunk_metadata(qdrant_point_id) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE;`**: This statement adds a new foreign key constraint named `chunk_collisions_collision_qdrant_id_fkey` to the `chunk_collisions` table.
    - This constraint establishes a relationship between the `collision_qdrant_id` column in the `chunk_collisions` table and the `qdrant_point_id` column in the `chunk_metadata` table.
    - The `ON DELETE CASCADE` and `ON UPDATE CASCADE` clauses ensure that if a record in the `chunk_metadata` table is deleted or updated (and its `qdrant_point_id` changes), any corresponding records in the `chunk_collisions` table referencing that `qdrant_point_id` will also be automatically deleted or updated accordingly.

#### Side Effects
- Modifies the database schema by altering the `chunk_collisions` table and its foreign key constraints.
- Impacts data integrity by enforcing cascading delete and update behavior between the `chunk_collisions` and `chunk_metadata` tables.
