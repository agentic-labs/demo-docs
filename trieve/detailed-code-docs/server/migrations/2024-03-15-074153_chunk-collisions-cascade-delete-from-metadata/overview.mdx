## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for modifying the `chunk_collisions` table in a database. The migration focuses on updating foreign key constraints to establish a cascading delete and update behavior with the `chunk_metadata` table. The directory includes both "up" and "down" migration scripts to allow for applying and reverting the changes.

## What does it do?
The migration scripts in this directory perform the following actions:

1. In the "up" migration:
   - Remove existing foreign key constraints on the `chunk_collisions` table.
   - Add new foreign key constraints that link `chunk_collisions` to `chunk_metadata` with cascading delete and update behavior.
   - This ensures that when a record in `chunk_metadata` is deleted or updated, corresponding records in `chunk_collisions` are automatically deleted or updated.

2. In the "down" migration:
   - Remove the cascading foreign key constraints added by the "up" migration.
   - Add back the original foreign key constraints without cascading behavior.

These changes affect how data integrity is maintained between the `chunk_collisions` and `chunk_metadata` tables, particularly in scenarios where records in `chunk_metadata` are modified or removed.

## Key Files

1. `up.sql`:
   This file contains the SQL statements to apply the migration. It modifies the `chunk_collisions` table by:
   - Dropping existing foreign key constraints.
   - Adding new foreign key constraints with `ON DELETE CASCADE` and `ON UPDATE CASCADE` clauses.

   Example of a key statement:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE chunk_collisions 
   ADD CONSTRAINT chunk_collisions_card_id_fkey 
   FOREIGN KEY (chunk_id) 
   REFERENCES chunk_metadata(id) 
   ON DELETE CASCADE 
   ON UPDATE CASCADE;
   ```

2. `down.sql`:
   This file contains the SQL statements to revert the migration. It modifies the `chunk_collisions` table by:
   - Dropping the cascading foreign key constraints added by `up.sql`.
   - Adding back the original foreign key constraints without cascading behavior.

   Example of a key statement:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE chunk_collisions 
   ADD CONSTRAINT card_collisions_card_id_fkey 
   FOREIGN KEY (chunk_id) 
   REFERENCES chunk_metadata(id);
   ```

Both files focus on two main relationships:
1. Between `chunk_id` in `chunk_collisions` and `id` in `chunk_metadata`.
2. Between `collision_qdrant_id` in `chunk_collisions` and `qdrant_point_id` in `chunk_metadata`.

## Configuration
The migration is identified by its timestamp: `2024-03-15-074153`. This timestamp is used to order migrations and ensure they are applied in the correct sequence.

No additional configuration files or environment variables are required for this migration.
