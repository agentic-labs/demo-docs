## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for removing the `is_public` column from the `card_collection` table in the database. It consists of two files: `up.sql` for applying the change and `down.sql` for reverting it. These migrations are part of a database schema update, likely aimed at simplifying the structure or removing an unused feature related to the public visibility of card collections.

## What does it do?
The migration scripts in this directory perform the following actions:

1. The `up.sql` script removes the `is_public` column from the `card_collection` table. This action eliminates the ability to mark card collections as public or private directly in the database.

2. The `down.sql` script adds the `is_public` column back to the `card_collection` table. This script is used to revert the changes made by the `up.sql` script if needed. The added column is of type boolean, not nullable, and has a default value of true.

These changes affect how the application handles the visibility of card collections. After applying the `up.sql` migration, the concept of public/private card collections, at least as represented by this column, will no longer exist in the database schema. This could indicate a shift in how the application manages access to card collections or a simplification of the data model.

## Key Files

1. `up.sql`:
   This file contains the SQL command to remove the `is_public` column from the `card_collection` table. Here's the content of the file:

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE card_collection DROP COLUMN is_public;
   ```

   This script is responsible for modifying the database schema to remove the `is_public` column.

2. `down.sql`:
   This file contains the SQL command to add back the `is_public` column to the `card_collection` table. Here's the content of the file:

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE card_collection ADD COLUMN is_public boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT true;
   ```

   This script is used to revert the changes made by the `up.sql` script, effectively restoring the database schema to its previous state.

## Dependencies
The migration scripts rely on the following:

1. SQL (Structured Query Language): Both scripts use standard SQL syntax to perform the database schema changes.

2. Existing `card_collection` table: Both scripts assume the existence of a `card_collection` table in the database.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files in this directory, the `down.sql` script implicitly defines a configuration for the `is_public` column:

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| is_public | boolean | true | Determines whether a card collection is public or not |

This configuration is relevant when reverting the migration or understanding the previous state of the database schema.

## Side Effects
Applying these migrations will have the following side effects:

1. After running `up.sql`:
   - The `is_public` column and all its data will be permanently removed from the `card_collection` table.
   - Any queries, views, or application code that previously relied on the `is_public` column will need to be updated to reflect this change.
   - The storage space used by the `is_public` column will be freed up in the database.

2. After running `down.sql`:
   - The `is_public` column will be added back to the `card_collection` table.
   - All existing rows in the `card_collection` table will have the `is_public` column added with a default value of `true`.
   - Queries or application code that were modified to work without the `is_public` column may need to be updated to handle its presence again.

It's important to note that these migrations should be applied carefully, considering their impact on the application's functionality and data integrity. Proper testing and coordination with application code changes are crucial when implementing such database schema modifications.
