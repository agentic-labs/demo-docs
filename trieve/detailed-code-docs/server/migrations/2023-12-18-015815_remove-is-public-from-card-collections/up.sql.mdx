## High-level description
This SQL migration script removes the `is_public` column from the `card_collection` table in the database. It's part of a database schema change, likely to simplify the structure or remove an unused feature related to the public visibility of card collections.

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE card_collection DROP COLUMN is_public;
#### Description
This SQL statement alters the structure of the `card_collection` table by removing the `is_public` column.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `ALTER TABLE` command is used to modify the structure of an existing table.
2. `card_collection` is the name of the table being altered.
3. `DROP COLUMN` is the specific alteration being made, which removes a column from the table.
4. `is_public` is the name of the column being removed from the table.

## Side Effects
- The `is_public` column and all its data will be permanently removed from the `card_collection` table.
- Any queries, views, or application code that previously relied on the `is_public` column will need to be updated to reflect this change.
- The storage space used by the `is_public` column will be freed up in the database.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in this migration script.

Note: This migration is part of a larger set of database changes, as indicated by the file name `2023-12-18-015815_remove-is-public-from-card-collections/up.sql`. There's likely a corresponding `down.sql` file that would contain the reverse operation to add the column back if needed.
