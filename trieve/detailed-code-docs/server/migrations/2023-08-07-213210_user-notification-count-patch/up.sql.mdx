## High-level description
This SQL script defines a function `update_notification_count()` that automatically manages a count of unread notifications for each user in a system. It's designed to be used as a trigger on a notifications table, incrementing or decrementing the count based on insert or delete operations.

## Symbols

### `update_notification_count`
#### Description
This function is a PostgreSQL trigger function written in PL/pgSQL. It's designed to keep the `user_notification_counts` table updated with the current number of unread notifications for each user. It does this by incrementing the count when a new notification is inserted for a user and decrementing it when a notification is deleted.

#### Inputs
This function implicitly uses data from the inserted or deleted notification record based on the trigger event.

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| NEW | RECORD | Represents the newly inserted notification record (available on INSERT operations). Contains fields like `id` and `author_id`. |
| OLD | RECORD | Represents the notification record being deleted (available on DELETE operations). Contains fields like `user_uuid`. |
| TG_OP | TEXT |  A special variable in PostgreSQL trigger functions that indicates the type of operation triggering the function: 'INSERT', 'UPDATE', or 'DELETE'. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| RETURN NEW | RECORD | This is a convention in PostgreSQL trigger functions. Returning `NEW` from an `INSERT` or `UPDATE` trigger signifies that the operation should proceed. In this case, the function primarily relies on side effects to update the `user_notification_counts` table. |

#### Internal Logic
1. **Determine Operation:** The function first checks the value of `TG_OP` to determine if it's an `INSERT` or `DELETE` operation.
2. **Handle INSERT:**
   - If it's an `INSERT`, it attempts to insert a new row into `user_notification_counts` with an initial count of 1. 
   - If a row for the user already exists (indicated by a conflict on the `user_id` which is likely a primary key), it increments the existing `notification_count` by 1 using an `ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` clause.
3. **Handle DELETE:**
   - If it's a `DELETE`, it decrements the `notification_count` in `user_notification_counts` for the user associated with the deleted notification.
4. **Return:** The function returns `NEW` for `INSERT` to allow the insertion to proceed. For `DELETE`, there's no explicit return as the primary action is the update to `user_notification_counts`.

#### Side Effects
- **Modifies `user_notification_counts` table:** This function directly modifies the `user_notification_counts` table by inserting, updating, or deleting rows based on the trigger events on the notifications table.

#### Performance Considerations
- **Indexes:** Ensure that `user_id` in `user_notification_counts` and `user_uuid` in the notifications table are indexed for efficient lookups during updates.
- **Concurrency:**  Consider potential concurrency issues if multiple operations can occur on the notifications table simultaneously. You might need to investigate more robust locking mechanisms within the function if concurrent modification becomes a problem.
