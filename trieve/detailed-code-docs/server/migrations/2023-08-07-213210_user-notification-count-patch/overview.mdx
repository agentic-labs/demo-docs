## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for a database update related to user notification counts. It includes two files: `up.sql` and `down.sql`. The `up.sql` file introduces a new function to manage user notification counts automatically, while the `down.sql` file is empty as there are no changes to revert.

## What does it do?
The migration introduces a new PostgreSQL function called `update_notification_count()`. This function is designed to be used as a trigger on a notifications table. Its purpose is to automatically maintain an accurate count of unread notifications for each user in the system.

When a new notification is added for a user, the function increments the notification count for that user. Conversely, when a notification is deleted, it decrements the count. This automation ensures that the system always has an up-to-date count of unread notifications for each user without requiring manual updates or complex queries each time the notification status changes.

## Key Files

1. `up.sql`: This file contains the SQL script that creates the `update_notification_count()` function. The function is written in PL/pgSQL and is designed to be triggered on INSERT and DELETE operations on the notifications table.

2. `down.sql`: This file is empty, containing only comments. It's part of the migration structure but doesn't perform any actions as there are no changes to revert in this particular migration.

## Configuration
The migration is identified by its timestamp: `2023-08-07-213210`. This suggests that the migration was created on August 7, 2023, at 21:32:10 UTC.

Here's a detailed look at the `update_notification_count()` function from `up.sql`:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_notification_count() RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
    IF (TG_OP = 'INSERT') THEN
        INSERT INTO user_notification_counts (user_id, notification_count)
        VALUES (NEW.author_id, 1)
        ON CONFLICT (user_id) DO UPDATE
        SET notification_count = user_notification_counts.notification_count + 1;
    ELSIF (TG_OP = 'DELETE') THEN
        UPDATE user_notification_counts
        SET notification_count = notification_count - 1
        WHERE user_id = OLD.user_uuid;
    END IF;
    RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

This function does the following:

1. On INSERT:
   - It attempts to insert a new row into the `user_notification_counts` table with an initial count of 1.
   - If a row for the user already exists, it increments the existing `notification_count` by 1.

2. On DELETE:
   - It decrements the `notification_count` in the `user_notification_counts` table for the user associated with the deleted notification.

The function uses the `NEW` and `OLD` special variables to access the data of the inserted or deleted notification, respectively. It also uses the `TG_OP` variable to determine whether the trigger was fired by an INSERT or DELETE operation.

It's important to note that this function assumes the existence of a `user_notification_counts` table with columns `user_id` and `notification_count`. It also assumes that the notifications table has columns `author_id` (for new notifications) and `user_uuid` (for deleted notifications).

To use this function, it would need to be set up as a trigger on the notifications table, which is not included in this migration. The trigger setup would likely be in another migration or part of the initial table creation script.
