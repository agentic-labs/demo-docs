## High-level description
This SQL migration script alters the `users` table by changing the data types of the `email` and `hash` columns from their current types to TEXT. This modification is likely intended to accommodate longer or more varied content in these fields.

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE users
#### Description
This SQL command modifies the structure of the `users` table.

#### Internal Logic
The command performs two alterations on the `users` table:
1. Changes the data type of the `email` column to TEXT.
2. Changes the data type of the `hash` column to TEXT.

## Side Effects
- The data types of the `email` and `hash` columns in the `users` table will be changed to TEXT.
- Existing data in these columns will be converted to the new TEXT type.
- This change may affect any queries or application code that relies on the previous data types of these columns.

## Performance Considerations
- Changing column types on a large table can be a time-consuming operation, especially if the table contains a significant amount of data.
- The TEXT data type in most SQL databases can store strings of any length, which provides flexibility but may use more storage space compared to fixed-length types.

## Notes
- This migration is part of a series, as indicated by the timestamp in the filename (2023-05-15-153411).
- The comment "-- Your SQL goes here" is likely a placeholder from a migration template and doesn't affect the actual SQL execution.
- The migration file is named "up.sql", suggesting it's part of a forward migration process. There might be a corresponding "down.sql" file for reverting these changes if needed.
