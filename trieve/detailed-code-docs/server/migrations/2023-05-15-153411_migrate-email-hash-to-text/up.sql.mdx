## High-level description
This SQL script modifies the `users` table in a database. It changes the data type of the `email` and `hash` columns from their previous type to `TEXT`. 

## Symbols

### `ALTER TABLE users`
#### Description
This statement initiates the modification of the existing `users` table. 

#### Internal Logic
It's important to note that the specific behavior of `ALTER TABLE` can vary depending on the database system being used. Some systems might implicitly handle data type conversions during the alteration, while others might require explicit data migration or casting.

### `ALTER COLUMN email TYPE TEXT`
#### Description
This statement modifies the `email` column within the `users` table. It changes the data type of the `email` column to `TEXT`.

#### Internal Logic
The choice of `TEXT` as the new data type suggests that the `email` column is intended to store potentially long email addresses. 

### `ALTER COLUMN hash TYPE TEXT`
#### Description
This statement modifies the `hash` column within the `users` table. It changes the data type of the `hash` column to `TEXT`.

#### Internal Logic
Similar to the `email` column, using `TEXT` for the `hash` column suggests that it might store long hash values, which is common for password hashes or other cryptographic hashes.
