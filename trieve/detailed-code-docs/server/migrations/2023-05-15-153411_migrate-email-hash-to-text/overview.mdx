## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for altering the `users` table in a database, specifically focusing on changing the data types of the `email` and `hash` columns. The migration is designed to modify these columns to use the TEXT data type, allowing for more flexible storage of email addresses and hash values.

## What does it do?
The migration scripts in this directory perform the following actions:

1. In the "up" direction (forward migration):
   - Changes the data type of the `email` column in the `users` table from its current type (likely VARCHAR) to TEXT.
   - Changes the data type of the `hash` column in the `users` table from its current type (likely VARCHAR) to TEXT.

2. In the "down" direction (rollback migration):
   - Reverts the `email` column in the `users` table back to VARCHAR(100).
   - Reverts the `hash` column in the `users` table back to VARCHAR(122).

These changes allow for storing longer or more varied content in the email and hash fields, which might be necessary for accommodating different email formats or hash algorithms.

## Key Files

### up.sql
This file contains the SQL commands for the forward migration. It alters the `users` table to change the data types of the `email` and `hash` columns to TEXT. Here's the content of the file:

```sql
ALTER TABLE users
ALTER COLUMN email TYPE TEXT,
ALTER COLUMN hash TYPE TEXT;
```

### down.sql
This file contains the SQL commands for rolling back the migration. It reverts the changes made by `up.sql`, changing the data types back to their original VARCHAR formats. Here's the content of the file:

```sql
ALTER TABLE users
ALTER COLUMN email TYPE VARCHAR(100),
ALTER COLUMN hash TYPE VARCHAR(122);
```

## Configuration
The migration is identified by its timestamp: 2023-05-15-153411. This timestamp is likely used by the migration system to track which migrations have been applied and in what order.

## Side Effects
Executing these migrations will have the following side effects:

1. The structure of the `users` table will be modified.
2. Existing data in the `email` and `hash` columns will be converted to the new data types.
3. Any application code or queries that rely on the specific data types of these columns may need to be updated.

## Performance Considerations
When running these migrations, especially on large tables, consider the following:

1. Changing column data types can be a time-consuming operation, particularly if the `users` table contains a significant amount of data.
2. The TEXT data type may use more storage space compared to fixed-length VARCHAR types, which could impact database size and query performance.
3. Indexes on these columns may need to be rebuilt after the data type change, which could also impact performance during the migration.

## Error Handling
These migration scripts do not include explicit error handling. If an error occurs during execution (e.g., if the columns don't exist or if there are data type incompatibilities), the database system will likely raise an error and roll back the changes. It's important to test these migrations thoroughly in a non-production environment before applying them to a live system.

In conclusion, this migration is a straightforward but potentially impactful change to the `users` table structure, allowing for more flexible storage of email addresses and hash values. Care should be taken when applying these changes, especially in production environments with large amounts of data.
