## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for modifying the `users` table in a database. The migration specifically changes the data types of the `email` and `hash` columns from their previous types to `TEXT`, and provides a way to revert these changes if needed.

## What does it do?
The migration performs the following actions:

1. In the "up" migration:
   - It changes the data type of the `email` column in the `users` table from its previous type (likely VARCHAR) to `TEXT`.
   - It changes the data type of the `hash` column in the `users` table from its previous type (likely VARCHAR) to `TEXT`.

2. In the "down" migration:
   - It reverts the changes made in the "up" migration.
   - It changes the data type of the `email` column back to `VARCHAR(100)`.
   - It changes the data type of the `hash` column back to `VARCHAR(122)`.

These changes allow for storing potentially longer email addresses and hash values in the database, which can be useful if the previous column sizes were too restrictive.

## Key Files

### up.sql
This file contains the SQL commands to perform the migration:

```sql
ALTER TABLE users ALTER COLUMN email TYPE TEXT;
ALTER TABLE users ALTER COLUMN hash TYPE TEXT;
```

These commands change the data types of the `email` and `hash` columns to `TEXT`.

### down.sql
This file contains the SQL commands to revert the migration:

```sql
ALTER TABLE users ALTER COLUMN email TYPE VARCHAR(100);
ALTER TABLE users ALTER COLUMN hash TYPE VARCHAR(122);
```

These commands change the data types of the `email` and `hash` columns back to their original types.

## Configuration
The migration is identified by its timestamp: `2023-05-15-153411`. This timestamp is likely used by the migration system to track which migrations have been applied and in what order.

## Side Effects
- This migration directly modifies the database schema by changing the data types of columns in the `users` table.
- Existing data in the `email` and `hash` columns will be preserved, but the column types will change.
- Applications or queries that rely on the specific column types (VARCHAR) may need to be updated to work with the new TEXT type.
- The change to TEXT allows for storing longer values, which could potentially impact storage requirements if many long values are stored.

## Error Handling
These SQL scripts do not implement specific error handling. Any errors encountered during the execution of the SQL statements will be returned to the client running the migration. It's important to test these migrations thoroughly, especially with existing data, to ensure that no data loss or unexpected behavior occurs during the type conversion.

## Additional Considerations
1. **Data Integrity**: While changing from VARCHAR to TEXT should not cause data loss, it's always a good practice to backup the database before applying such migrations.

2. **Performance**: TEXT fields can potentially have different performance characteristics compared to VARCHAR fields, especially for indexing and searching. The impact should be evaluated based on the specific use case and database system.

3. **Application Code**: Any application code that interacts with these columns should be reviewed to ensure it can handle potentially longer values.

4. **Database Constraints**: If there were any constraints (like unique constraints) on these columns, they might need to be recreated after the type change, depending on the database system.

5. **Reversibility**: The down migration provides a way to revert the changes, but it's important to note that if any data longer than the original VARCHAR limits was inserted after the up migration, reverting could potentially lead to data truncation.

This migration represents a common scenario in database management where the requirements for data storage evolve over time, necessitating changes to the underlying schema to accommodate new needs while maintaining backwards compatibility.
