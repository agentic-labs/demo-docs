title: "down.sql"
---

## High-level description
This SQL script is designed to undo the changes made by the corresponding `up.sql` migration file. It drops two tables: `stripe_subscriptions` and `stripe_plans`, effectively removing the Stripe-related data structures from the database.

## Symbols

### DROP TABLE stripe_subscriptions
#### Description
This SQL command removes the `stripe_subscriptions` table from the database.

#### Internal Logic
The `DROP TABLE` command is used to completely remove the table and all its data from the database schema. This operation is irreversible without a backup or the ability to recreate the table.

### DROP TABLE stripe_plans
#### Description
This SQL command removes the `stripe_plans` table from the database.

#### Internal Logic
Similar to the previous command, this `DROP TABLE` statement completely removes the `stripe_plans` table and all its associated data from the database schema.

## Side Effects
- Permanent deletion of all data stored in the `stripe_subscriptions` table.
- Permanent deletion of all data stored in the `stripe_plans` table.
- Removal of any foreign key constraints or indexes associated with these tables.
- Potential impact on any database views or stored procedures that reference these tables.

## Performance Considerations
Dropping tables is generally a fast operation, but it can have a momentary impact on database performance, especially if the tables are large or if there are many concurrent database operations.

## Error Handling
This script does not include explicit error handling. If either table does not exist when the script is run, it will likely result in an SQL error. It's assumed that the migration framework or the person executing this script will handle any potential errors.

## Notes
1. This is a database migration "down" script, typically used to revert changes made by a corresponding "up" migration.
2. The comment at the top of the file indicates that this script should undo anything done in the `up.sql` file.
3. The order of dropping tables matters if there are foreign key relationships. In this case, `stripe_subscriptions` is dropped before `stripe_plans`, which suggests that `stripe_subscriptions` might have had a foreign key reference to `stripe_plans`.
4. Executing this script will result in permanent data loss. It should be used with caution, typically only in development environments or when intentionally reverting a migration in a controlled manner.
5. There are no safeguards or checks in this script (like `IF EXISTS`), so it assumes the tables exist when it's run.
