## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for creating and managing Stripe-related tables in the database. It includes two files: `up.sql` for creating the tables and `down.sql` for dropping them. These migrations are specifically designed to handle Stripe plans and subscriptions, allowing the application to store and manage information about different subscription plans and their associated organizations.

## What does it do?
The migration scripts in this directory set up the database structure for handling Stripe subscription plans and organizational subscriptions. Here's a breakdown of what these scripts accomplish:

1. The `up.sql` script creates two new tables:
   - `stripe_plans`: This table stores information about different subscription plans offered through Stripe. It includes details such as the plan's unique identifiers, allowed resource limits (e.g., card count, file storage, user count), pricing, and timestamps.
   - `stripe_subscriptions`: This table links organizations to their chosen Stripe plans. It stores information about each subscription, including unique identifiers, the associated plan, the subscribing organization, and timestamps.

2. The `down.sql` script provides a way to reverse the changes made by `up.sql`. It drops both the `stripe_subscriptions` and `stripe_plans` tables, effectively removing all Stripe-related data from the database.

These migrations allow the application to:
- Store and manage different subscription plan options
- Keep track of which organizations are subscribed to which plans
- Maintain important details about each subscription and plan
- Easily upgrade or downgrade an organization's subscription by updating the relevant records

## Key Files

1. `up.sql`:
   This file contains the SQL commands to create the `stripe_plans` and `stripe_subscriptions` tables. It defines the structure of these tables, including all columns, data types, and relationships. Key aspects of this file include:
   - Definition of the `stripe_plans` table with columns for plan details (e.g., `card_count`, `file_storage`, `user_count`, `amount`)
   - Creation of the `stripe_subscriptions` table with foreign key relationships to both `stripe_plans` and an external `organizations` table
   - Use of UUID as the primary key for both tables
   - Inclusion of `created_at` and `updated_at` timestamps for both tables

2. `down.sql`:
   This file contains the SQL commands to drop the tables created by `up.sql`. It's a simple file with two commands:
   ```sql
   DROP TABLE stripe_subscriptions;
   DROP TABLE stripe_plans;
   ```
   These commands will remove the Stripe-related tables from the database, effectively undoing the changes made by the `up.sql` script.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files in this directory, the migration scripts themselves serve as a form of configuration for the database schema. The `up.sql` file, in particular, defines the structure of the Stripe-related tables:

1. `stripe_plans` table configuration:
   - `id`: UUID, primary key
   - `stripe_id`: TEXT, Stripe's unique identifier for the plan
   - `card_count`: INTEGER, number of cards allowed in the plan
   - `file_storage`: INTEGER, amount of file storage included
   - `user_count`: INTEGER, number of users allowed
   - `dataset_count`: INTEGER, number of datasets allowed
   - `message_count`: INTEGER, number of messages allowed
   - `amount`: BIGINT, price of the plan
   - `created_at`: TIMESTAMP
   - `updated_at`: TIMESTAMP

2. `stripe_subscriptions` table configuration:
   - `id`: UUID, primary key
   - `stripe_id`: TEXT, Stripe's unique identifier for the subscription
   - `plan_id`: UUID, foreign key referencing `stripe_plans.id`
   - `organization_id`: UUID, foreign key referencing `organizations.id`
   - `created_at`: TIMESTAMP
   - `updated_at`: TIMESTAMP

These table definitions determine how the application will store and interact with Stripe plan and subscription data. Developers should be aware of these structures when working with Stripe-related features in the application.

It's worth noting that the `stripe_subscriptions` table has a foreign key relationship with an `organizations` table, which is not defined in these migration scripts. This suggests that the `organizations` table is defined elsewhere in the database schema and is an important part of the overall application structure.
