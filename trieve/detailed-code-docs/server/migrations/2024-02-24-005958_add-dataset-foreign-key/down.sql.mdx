title: "down.sql"

## High-level description
This SQL script reverts the database migration that added a foreign key constraint named `dataset_id_fkey` to multiple tables, referencing the `datasets` table. This suggests that the original migration aimed to enforce referential integrity between these tables and the `datasets` table.

## Symbols
### `down.sql`
#### Description
This SQL script undoes the changes made in the corresponding `up.sql` script, specifically reverting the addition of a foreign key constraint (`dataset_id_fkey`) to several tables. This constraint likely enforced referential integrity with the `datasets` table.

#### Internal Logic
The script iterates through the following tables:

- `dataset_usage_counts`
- `events`
- `chunk_metadata`
- `chunk_group`
- `files`
- `chunk_files`
- `messages`
- `topics`

For each table, it performs these actions:

1. **Drops the existing foreign key constraint:** `DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS [table_name]_dataset_id_fkey;`
2. **Adds a foreign key constraint:** `ADD CONSTRAINT [possibly_incorrect_name]_dataset_id_fkey FOREIGN KEY (dataset_id) REFERENCES datasets(id);`

**Note:** The script seems to contain errors in the naming of the added constraints. For instance, it attempts to add `notifications_dataset_id_fkey` to the `events` table and `card_metadata_dataset_id_fkey` to the `chunk_metadata` table. These names seem inconsistent and likely incorrect. It's crucial to review and correct these constraint names to ensure the script functions as intended.
