## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for adding and removing foreign key constraints in a database schema. The migration is focused on establishing relationships between various tables and the `datasets` table, ensuring referential integrity across the database.

## What does it do?
The migration scripts in this directory perform the following actions:

1. In the "up" migration (`up.sql`):
   - Add foreign key constraints to multiple tables (`dataset_usage_counts`, `events`, `chunk_metadata`, `chunk_group`, `files`, `chunk_files`, `messages`, and `topics`), linking them to the `datasets` table.
   - Ensure that updates and deletions in the `datasets` table cascade to the related tables.

2. In the "down" migration (`down.sql`):
   - Remove the foreign key constraints added by the "up" migration.
   - Attempt to re-add constraints, though there are some naming inconsistencies that may need to be addressed.

These migrations help maintain data consistency and integrity by ensuring that records in various tables are properly linked to existing datasets. The cascading updates and deletions ensure that changes to the `datasets` table are reflected in all related tables.

## Key Files

### up.sql
This file contains the SQL statements to apply the migration, adding foreign key constraints to various tables. Here's an example of one of the statements:

```sql
ALTER TABLE dataset_usage_counts
DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS dataset_usage_counts_dataset_id_fkey,
ADD CONSTRAINT dataset_usage_counts_dataset_id_fkey 
FOREIGN KEY (dataset_id) 
REFERENCES datasets(id) 
ON UPDATE CASCADE 
ON DELETE CASCADE;
```

This pattern is repeated for each table, with appropriate naming changes.

### down.sql
This file contains the SQL statements to revert the migration, removing the added foreign key constraints. However, it also attempts to add constraints back, which may be an error. Here's an example:

```sql
ALTER TABLE dataset_usage_counts
DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS dataset_usage_counts_dataset_id_fkey,
ADD CONSTRAINT dataset_usage_counts_dataset_id_fkey 
FOREIGN KEY (dataset_id) 
REFERENCES datasets(id);
```

Note that the `down.sql` script contains some inconsistencies in constraint naming that should be reviewed and corrected.

## Configuration
The migration scripts use standard SQL syntax and do not require additional configuration. However, the database system must support foreign key constraints and cascading actions for these migrations to work correctly.

It's important to note that the `down.sql` script contains some naming inconsistencies that should be addressed before applying the migration in a production environment. For example, it attempts to add a constraint named `notifications_dataset_id_fkey` to the `events` table, which doesn't match the table name and may cause issues.

When applying these migrations, database administrators should carefully review the scripts, especially the `down.sql` file, to ensure that the constraint names are consistent and correct for each table. This will prevent potential issues if the migration needs to be rolled back in the future.
