## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for optimizing API key lookups in the database. The migration is dated 2024-04-11 and is titled "make-api-key-faster". It consists of two files: `up.sql` for applying the changes and `down.sql` for reverting them. The main focus is on modifying the `user_api_key` table structure to improve performance.

## What does it do?
The migration scripts in this directory make changes to the database to speed up API key lookups. Here's what happens:

1. A new column called `blake3_hash` is added to the `user_api_key` table. This column is designed to store a different type of hash (BLAKE3) for the API keys, which is likely faster to compute and compare than the existing hash.

2. The existing `api_key_hash` column is modified to allow null values. This change suggests that the system might be transitioning to use the new `blake3_hash` column for primary lookups, while keeping the old hash for compatibility or backup purposes.

If these changes need to be undone, the `down.sql` script reverses these modifications by:

1. Removing the newly added `blake3_hash` column.
2. Making the `api_key_hash` column mandatory (not null) again.

These changes aim to optimize the database structure for faster API key lookups, which can significantly improve the performance of authentication processes in the application.

## Key Files

1. `up.sql`:
   This file contains the SQL commands to apply the optimization changes. It adds the `blake3_hash` column and modifies the `api_key_hash` column to allow null values.

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE user_api_key ADD COLUMN blake3_hash TEXT;
   ALTER TABLE user_api_key ALTER COLUMN api_key_hash DROP NOT NULL;
   ```

2. `down.sql`:
   This file contains the SQL commands to revert the changes made by `up.sql`. It removes the `blake3_hash` column and makes the `api_key_hash` column mandatory again.

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE user_api_key ALTER COLUMN api_key_hash SET NOT NULL;
   ALTER TABLE user_api_key DROP COLUMN blake3_hash;
   ```

These files work together to provide a reversible database migration, allowing the development team to apply or roll back the optimization changes as needed.

## Configuration
This migration doesn't require any specific configuration files or environment variables. However, it's important to note that the migration is named with a timestamp (2024-04-11-052101), which is likely used by the migration system to track and apply migrations in the correct order.

The naming convention suggests that this migration system might be using a tool like Diesel for Rust or a similar database migration framework that uses timestamped migration files.
