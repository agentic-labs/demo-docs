## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for modifying the `chunk_group` table in a database. The migration adds two new columns, `metadata` and `tag_set`, to the table and creates corresponding indexes. It also includes a rollback script to undo these changes if necessary.

## What does it do?
The migration scripts in this directory perform the following actions:

1. Add a new `metadata` column to the `chunk_group` table, which can store JSON data.
2. Add a new `tag_set` column to the `chunk_group` table for storing text data.
3. Create indexes on both new columns to improve query performance.
4. Provide a way to revert these changes by dropping the newly added columns and indexes.

These changes allow for storing additional information (metadata) and tags associated with chunk groups, which can be useful for categorization, searching, or filtering purposes.

## Key Files

### up.sql
This file contains the SQL statements to apply the migration:

```sql
ALTER TABLE chunk_group ADD COLUMN metadata JSONB NULL DEFAULT '{}'::JSONB;
ALTER TABLE chunk_group ADD COLUMN tag_set text NULL;
CREATE INDEX idx_chunk_group_metadata ON chunk_group(metadata);
CREATE INDEX idx_chunk_group_tag_set ON chunk_group(tag_set);
```

The script adds two new columns to the `chunk_group` table:
- `metadata`: A JSONB column that can store structured data, with a default value of an empty JSON object.
- `tag_set`: A text column that can store tags or labels.

It also creates indexes on these new columns to improve query performance when searching or filtering based on metadata or tags.

### down.sql
This file contains the SQL statements to revert the migration:

```sql
ALTER TABLE chunk_group DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS metadata;
ALTER TABLE chunk_group DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS tag_set;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_chunk_group_metadata;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_chunk_group_tag_set;
```

The script removes the columns and indexes added by the `up.sql` script. The `IF EXISTS` clauses ensure that the script doesn't fail if the columns or indexes have already been removed.

## Configuration
This migration doesn't require any specific configuration. However, it's important to note that the migration is designed for a database system that supports JSONB data types (such as PostgreSQL). The migration scripts should be executed using a database migration tool or framework that can handle these SQL files appropriately.

When applying this migration, ensure that:
1. The database user has the necessary permissions to alter tables and create indexes.
2. The `chunk_group` table exists in the database before running the migration.
3. The database system supports JSONB data types.

It's also worth noting that the `metadata` column is set to allow NULL values and has a default value of an empty JSON object. This means that existing rows in the `chunk_group` table will automatically have an empty object in the `metadata` column after the migration is applied.

The `tag_set` column is also set to allow NULL values, which means it's optional and can be left empty for chunk groups that don't require tags.

When using these new columns in your application, remember to handle potential NULL values and ensure that any data inserted into the `metadata` column is valid JSON.
