title: "down.sql"

## High-level description
This SQL migration file is designed to undo the changes made by the corresponding `up.sql` file. It drops the `card_collection_bookmarks` table, effectively removing it from the database schema.

## Symbols

### `DROP TABLE card_collection_bookmarks;`
#### Description
This SQL command removes the `card_collection_bookmarks` table from the database schema.

#### Internal Logic
The `DROP TABLE` statement is used to completely remove a table and all its data from the database. This operation is irreversible and will delete all records stored in the `card_collection_bookmarks` table.

## Side Effects
- Permanent deletion of the `card_collection_bookmarks` table and all its contents.
- Any database objects (like views, indexes, or foreign keys) that depend on this table may also be affected or become invalid.

## Dependencies
This migration script doesn't explicitly depend on any external libraries or modules. It uses standard SQL syntax that should be compatible with most relational database management systems.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this script. If the table doesn't exist when trying to drop it, most database systems will raise an error. It's assumed that the database system or the migration tool running this script will handle any potential errors.

## TODOs
The comment at the top of the file, "This file should undo anything in `up.sql`", serves as a reminder and guideline for the purpose of this migration script. It suggests that there should be a corresponding `up.sql` file that created the `card_collection_bookmarks` table, and this `down.sql` file is intended to revert those changes.
