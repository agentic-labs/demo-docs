## Symbols

### `card_collection_bookmarks`
#### Description
This SQL statement defines a new table named `card_collection_bookmarks` with the specified columns and constraints.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a table definition, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a table definition, not a function.

#### Internal Logic
- `id UUID PRIMARY KEY`: Defines the primary key column named "id" of type UUID. The `PRIMARY KEY` constraint ensures uniqueness and that the column cannot be NULL.
- `collection_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES card_collection(id)`: Defines the "collection_id" column of type UUID, which cannot be NULL. The `REFERENCES card_collection(id)` constraint establishes a foreign key relationship with the "id" column of the "card_collection" table.
- `card_metadata_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES card_metadata(id)`: Defines the "card_metadata_id" column of type UUID, which cannot be NULL. The `REFERENCES card_metadata(id)` constraint establishes a foreign key relationship with the "id" column of the "card_metadata" table.
- `created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()`: Defines the "created_at" column of type TIMESTAMP, which cannot be NULL. The `DEFAULT NOW()` constraint sets the current timestamp as the default value for this column.
- `updated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()`: Defines the "updated_at" column of type TIMESTAMP, which cannot be NULL. The `DEFAULT NOW()` constraint sets the current timestamp as the default value for this column.

## Side Effects
- Creates a new table named `card_collection_bookmarks` in the database.
- Establishes foreign key relationships with the `card_collection` and `card_metadata` tables.
