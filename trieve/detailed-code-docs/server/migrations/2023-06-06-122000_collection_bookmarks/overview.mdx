## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for creating and managing a `card_collection_bookmarks` table in the database. The migration is dated 2023-06-06 and is specifically designed to handle bookmarks for cards within collections.

## What does it do?
These migration scripts add functionality to the database that allows users to bookmark specific cards within a collection. This feature enables users to mark or save important or relevant cards for quick access or reference. The migration creates a new table that establishes relationships between card collections and card metadata, effectively creating a bookmarking system for cards within collections.

## Key Files
1. `up.sql`: This file contains the SQL commands to create the `card_collection_bookmarks` table. It defines the structure of the table and sets up the necessary relationships with other tables in the database.

2. `down.sql`: This file contains the SQL command to drop the `card_collection_bookmarks` table, effectively undoing the changes made by the `up.sql` file.

## Dependencies
The `card_collection_bookmarks` table has dependencies on two other tables in the database:

1. `card_collection`: The `collection_id` column in the `card_collection_bookmarks` table references the `id` column in the `card_collection` table.
2. `card_metadata`: The `card_metadata_id` column in the `card_collection_bookmarks` table references the `id` column in the `card_metadata` table.

These dependencies are enforced through foreign key constraints, ensuring data integrity within the database.

## Configuration
The migration scripts do not require any specific configuration. They use standard SQL syntax that should be compatible with most relational database management systems.

## Detailed Explanation

### up.sql

The `up.sql` file creates the `card_collection_bookmarks` table with the following structure:

```sql
CREATE TABLE card_collection_bookmarks (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    collection_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES card_collection(id),
    card_metadata_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES card_metadata(id),
    created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

Let's break down the columns:

1. `id`: A unique identifier for each bookmark entry, automatically incremented (SERIAL).
2. `collection_id`: References the `card_collection` table, indicating which collection the bookmark belongs to.
3. `card_metadata_id`: References the `card_metadata` table, specifying which card is bookmarked.
4. `created_at`: Timestamp for when the bookmark was created, automatically set to the current time.
5. `updated_at`: Timestamp for when the bookmark was last updated, initially set to the creation time.

The `REFERENCES` clauses establish foreign key relationships, ensuring that `collection_id` and `card_metadata_id` always refer to existing entries in their respective tables.

### down.sql

The `down.sql` file contains a single command to drop the `card_collection_bookmarks` table:

```sql
DROP TABLE card_collection_bookmarks;
```

This command removes the table and all its data from the database schema, effectively undoing the changes made by the `up.sql` script.

## Performance Considerations

1. The `id` column is set as the PRIMARY KEY, which automatically creates an index on this column. This optimizes queries that search or join on the `id` field.

2. Depending on the usage patterns of the application, it might be beneficial to create additional indexes on the `collection_id` and `card_metadata_id` columns. This would be particularly useful if there are frequent queries filtering or joining on these columns.

## Error Handling

The migration scripts rely on the database system's built-in error handling. For example:

1. In `up.sql`, if an attempt is made to insert a bookmark with non-existent `collection_id` or `card_metadata_id`, the database will raise an error due to the foreign key constraints.

2. In `down.sql`, if the table doesn't exist when trying to drop it, most database systems will raise an error. It's assumed that the migration tool running these scripts will handle any potential errors.

## Conclusion

This migration adds a bookmarking feature to the application's database, allowing users to save specific cards within collections. The structure supports tracking when bookmarks are created and updated, and ensures data integrity through foreign key relationships. When implementing features that use this table, developers should consider the performance implications of their queries and may need to add indexes based on common query patterns.
