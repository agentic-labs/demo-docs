## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for modifying the foreign key constraint between the `user_organizations` and `organizations` tables in a database. The migration adds a cascading delete behavior to the foreign key constraint, ensuring that when an organization is deleted, all associated user organization records are automatically removed.

## What does it do?
The migration scripts in this directory perform the following actions:

1. In the "up" direction (applying the migration):
   - It removes the existing foreign key constraint on the `user_organizations` table.
   - It adds a new foreign key constraint with the same name, but now including an `ON DELETE CASCADE` clause.
   
2. In the "down" direction (reverting the migration):
   - It removes the cascading foreign key constraint added by the "up" migration.
   - It adds back a standard foreign key constraint without the cascading delete behavior.

This change in the database structure affects how deletions are handled. After applying the "up" migration, when an organization is deleted from the `organizations` table, all related records in the `user_organizations` table will be automatically deleted as well. This ensures data consistency and prevents orphaned records in the `user_organizations` table.

## Key Files

### up.sql
This file contains the SQL commands to apply the migration:

```sql
ALTER TABLE user_organizations DROP CONSTRAINT fk_organization_id;

ALTER TABLE user_organizations
ADD CONSTRAINT user_organizations_organization_id_fkey
FOREIGN KEY (organization_id) REFERENCES organizations(id)
ON DELETE CASCADE;
```

It drops the existing foreign key constraint and adds a new one with cascading delete behavior.

### down.sql
This file contains the SQL commands to revert the migration:

```sql
ALTER TABLE user_organizations DROP CONSTRAINT user_organizations_organization_id_fkey;

ALTER TABLE user_organizations
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_organization_id
FOREIGN KEY (organization_id) REFERENCES organizations(id);
```

It removes the cascading foreign key constraint and adds back a standard foreign key constraint without the cascading delete behavior.

## Configuration
The migration is identified by its timestamp: `2024-02-25-222304`. This timestamp is likely used by the migration tool to track which migrations have been applied and in what order.

## Dependencies
This migration assumes the existence of two tables in the database:
1. `organizations` - The parent table containing organization records.
2. `user_organizations` - A table that likely represents a many-to-many relationship between users and organizations.

The migration also depends on the database system supporting `ON DELETE CASCADE` behavior for foreign key constraints.
