## High-level description
This SQL script reverts a database migration related to the foreign key constraint between `user_organizations` and `organizations` tables. It specifically undoes the changes made in the corresponding `up.sql` script.

### `down.sql`
#### Description
This script removes the existing foreign key constraint `user_organizations_organization_id_fkey` from the `user_organizations` table and adds a new constraint `fk_organization_id` referencing the `organizations` table. This likely reverts a change where the `ON DELETE CASCADE` behavior was added to the foreign key in the `up.sql` migration.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Drop Existing Constraint:** `ALTER TABLE user_organizations DROP CONSTRAINT user_organizations_organization_id_fkey;` - This line removes the existing foreign key constraint named `user_organizations_organization_id_fkey` from the `user_organizations` table.

2. **Add New Constraint:**
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE user_organizations
   ADD CONSTRAINT fk_organization_id
   FOREIGN KEY (organization_id) REFERENCES organizations(id);
   ```
   - These lines add a new foreign key constraint named `fk_organization_id` to the `user_organizations` table. 
   - The constraint sets the `organization_id` column as a foreign key referencing the `id` column of the `organizations` table. 
   - Notably, this new constraint does not specify any `ON DELETE` behavior, meaning it defaults to the standard SQL behavior, which is `NO ACTION` (or `RESTRICT` depending on the database system). This means deleting a row in `organizations` would be restricted if a related row exists in `user_organizations`.

#### Side Effects
- Modifies the database schema by changing the foreign key constraint on the `user_organizations` table.
- Impacts data integrity rules related to deleting records from the `organizations` table.
