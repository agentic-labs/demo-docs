## High-level description
This SQL script reverts the database migration defined in the corresponding `up.sql` file. Specifically, it drops the index named `idx_link_gin` if it exists. This suggests that the `up.sql` file likely creates this index, potentially using a GIN index for full-text search functionality.

## Symbols

### `DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_link_gin;`
#### Description
This SQL statement attempts to drop an index named `idx_link_gin`. The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the statement executes successfully even if the index does not exist. This is a common practice in migration scripts to prevent errors when reverting changes.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Check for Existence:** The database checks if an index named `idx_link_gin` exists.
2. **Conditional Drop:**
   - If the index exists, the `DROP INDEX` command is executed, removing the index from the database.
   - If the index does not exist, no action is taken.

#### Side Effects
- **Index Removal:** If the `idx_link_gin` index exists, it will be permanently removed from the database. This may impact the performance of queries that previously utilized this index.
