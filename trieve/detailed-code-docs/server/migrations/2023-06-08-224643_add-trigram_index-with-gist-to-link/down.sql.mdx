title: "down.sql"

## High-level description
This SQL script reverts the database migration defined in the corresponding `up.sql` file, specifically by removing the "idx_link_gin" index from the database. This suggests that the `up.sql` file likely creates this index, potentially using the GIST indexing method for link columns.

## Symbols

### `DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_link_gin;`
#### Description
This SQL statement attempts to drop an index named "idx_link_gin" from the database. The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the operation doesn't fail if the index doesn't exist. This is a common practice in migration scripts to handle cases where the script might be run multiple times.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Check for Existence:** The database checks if an index named "idx_link_gin" exists.
2. **Conditional Drop:**
   - If the index exists, it is dropped from the database.
   - If the index doesn't exist, the statement completes without any action.
