## High-level description
This SQL script creates a Generalized Inverted Index (GIN) index on the `link` column of the `card_metadata` table using the `gin_trgm_ops` operator class. This index is designed to speed up similarity searches on the `link` column using the trigram matching technique. 

## Symbols

### `CREATE INDEX idx_link_gin`
#### Description
This statement creates a new index named `idx_link_gin` on the `card_metadata` table.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `card_metadata` | Table | The table on which the index is created. |
| `link` | Column | The column on which the index is created. |
| `gin_trgm_ops` | Operator class | Specifies that the index should use the GIN index structure and the `gin_trgm_ops` operator class for trigram matching. |

#### Outputs
A new GIN index named `idx_link_gin` on the `link` column of the `card_metadata` table.

#### Internal Logic
The index utilizes the `gin_trgm_ops` operator class, which enables efficient trigram-based similarity searches. Trigrams are groups of three consecutive characters extracted from a string. The index stores these trigrams and their positions within the `link` column, allowing for fast retrieval of rows containing similar `link` values.
