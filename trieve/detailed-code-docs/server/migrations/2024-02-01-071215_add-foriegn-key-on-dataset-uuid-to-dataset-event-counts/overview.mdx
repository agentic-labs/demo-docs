## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for modifying the `dataset_event_counts` table in a database. The migration adds a foreign key constraint, a unique constraint, and sets the `dataset_uuid` column to non-nullable. These changes ensure data integrity and establish a proper relationship between the `dataset_event_counts` table and a `datasets` table.

## What does it do?
The migration scripts in this directory perform the following actions:

1. Add a foreign key constraint to the `dataset_uuid` column in the `dataset_event_counts` table, linking it to the `id` column in the `datasets` table.
2. Add a unique constraint to the `dataset_uuid` column to prevent duplicate entries.
3. Set the `dataset_uuid` column to non-nullable, ensuring that every row has a valid dataset reference.
4. Provide a way to reverse these changes if needed.

These changes improve data consistency and enforce referential integrity between the `dataset_event_counts` and `datasets` tables. This means that every event count entry will be associated with a valid dataset, and there won't be any orphaned or duplicate entries.

## Key Files

### up.sql
This file contains the SQL commands to apply the migration:

```sql
ALTER TABLE dataset_event_counts
ADD CONSTRAINT dataset_event_counts_dataset_uuid_fkey 
FOREIGN KEY (dataset_uuid) 
REFERENCES datasets (id) 
ON UPDATE CASCADE 
ON DELETE CASCADE;

ALTER TABLE dataset_event_counts
ADD CONSTRAINT dataset_event_counts_dataset_uuid_unique 
UNIQUE (dataset_uuid);

ALTER TABLE dataset_event_counts
ALTER COLUMN dataset_uuid SET NOT NULL;
```

These commands add the foreign key constraint, unique constraint, and set the `dataset_uuid` column to non-nullable.

### down.sql
This file contains the SQL commands to reverse the migration:

```sql
ALTER TABLE dataset_event_counts 
DROP CONSTRAINT dataset_event_counts_dataset_uuid_fkey;

ALTER TABLE dataset_event_counts 
DROP CONSTRAINT dataset_event_counts_dataset_uuid_unique;
```

These commands remove the foreign key and unique constraints added by the `up.sql` script.

## Dependencies
This migration relies on the existence of two tables:
1. `dataset_event_counts`: The table being modified
2. `datasets`: The table referenced by the new foreign key constraint

No external libraries or frameworks are directly used in these SQL scripts.

## Configuration
These migration scripts don't require any specific configuration. However, they should be run using a database migration tool that supports up and down migrations, such as Flyway, Liquibase, or a custom migration system built into the application.

The migration filename `2024-02-01-071215_add-foriegn-key-on-dataset-uuid-to-dataset-event-counts` suggests that this migration was created on February 1, 2024, at 07:12:15. This naming convention is likely used by the migration tool to determine the order in which migrations should be applied.

It's important to note that applying this migration may fail if:
1. The `dataset_event_counts` table doesn't exist
2. The `datasets` table doesn't exist
3. The `dataset_uuid` column in `dataset_event_counts` or the `id` column in `datasets` doesn't exist
4. There are existing rows in `dataset_event_counts` with NULL values in the `dataset_uuid` column
5. There are existing rows in `dataset_event_counts` with `dataset_uuid` values that don't correspond to valid `id` values in the `datasets` table

Before applying this migration in a production environment, it's crucial to backup the database and test the migration in a staging environment to ensure it doesn't cause data loss or integrity issues.
