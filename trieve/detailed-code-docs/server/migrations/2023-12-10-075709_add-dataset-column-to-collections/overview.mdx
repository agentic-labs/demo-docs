## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for adding a `dataset_id` column to the `card_metadata` and `card_collection` tables in a database schema. The migration is designed to establish a relationship between these tables and a `datasets` table, likely to associate card metadata and collections with specific datasets.

## What does it do?
The migration scripts in this directory perform the following actions:

1. In the "up" migration:
   - Add a new `dataset_id` column of type UUID to both the `card_metadata` and `card_collection` tables.
   - Set up foreign key constraints to ensure that the `dataset_id` in these tables always references a valid `id` in the `datasets` table.
   - Attempt to drop a `dataset_id` column from the `card_collection_bookmarks` table if it exists, likely to clean up any previous migration attempts or to prepare for future changes.

2. In the "down" migration:
   - Remove the `dataset_id` column from both the `card_metadata` and `card_collection` tables, effectively reverting the changes made by the "up" migration.

These changes allow the system to associate card metadata and collections with specific datasets, which could be useful for organizing and filtering data based on its source or category.

## Key Files

### up.sql
This file contains the SQL commands to perform the forward migration. It adds the `dataset_id` column to the necessary tables and sets up the foreign key constraints. Here's a breakdown of its main actions:

```sql
ALTER TABLE card_collection_bookmarks DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS dataset_id;

ALTER TABLE card_metadata ADD COLUMN dataset_id UUID NOT NULL;
ALTER TABLE card_collection ADD COLUMN dataset_id UUID NOT NULL;

ALTER TABLE card_metadata ADD CONSTRAINT card_metadata_dataset_id_fkey 
    FOREIGN KEY (dataset_id) REFERENCES datasets(id);
ALTER TABLE card_collection ADD CONSTRAINT card_collection_dataset_id_fkey 
    FOREIGN KEY (dataset_id) REFERENCES datasets(id);
```

### down.sql
This file contains the SQL commands to revert the changes made by the up.sql script. It simply drops the `dataset_id` column from the affected tables:

```sql
ALTER TABLE card_metadata DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS dataset_id;
ALTER TABLE card_collection DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS dataset_id;
```

## Configuration
The migration is identified by its timestamp: 2023-12-10-075709. This timestamp is likely used by a migration management system to track which migrations have been applied and in what order.

No additional configuration appears to be required for these migration scripts. However, it's important to note that:

1. The scripts assume the existence of a `datasets` table with an `id` column of type UUID.
2. The `card_metadata` and `card_collection` tables must exist prior to running this migration.
3. The database system must support UUID data types.

When applying these migrations, database administrators should ensure that:

1. There is no existing data in the `card_metadata` or `card_collection` tables that would violate the new NOT NULL constraint on the `dataset_id` column.
2. The `datasets` table is populated with the necessary data before establishing the foreign key relationships.
3. Any application code interacting with these tables is updated to handle the new `dataset_id` column.

It's also worth noting that the attempt to drop the `dataset_id` column from `card_collection_bookmarks` in the up migration suggests there might be some ongoing schema changes or cleanup processes happening in parallel with this migration.
