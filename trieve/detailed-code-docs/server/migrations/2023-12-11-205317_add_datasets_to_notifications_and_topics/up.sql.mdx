## High-level description
This SQL migration script adds a `dataset_id` column to the `file_upload_completed_notifications`, `topics`, and `messages` tables. It also establishes foreign key relationships between these tables and the `datasets` table using the new `dataset_id` column.

### ALTER TABLE statements
#### Description
These statements modify the structure of existing tables by adding a new column and creating foreign key constraints.

#### Internal Logic
1. Add `dataset_id` column:
   - Adds a `dataset_id` column of type UUID to `file_upload_completed_notifications`, `topics`, and `messages` tables.
   - The column is set as NOT NULL, requiring a value for all rows.

2. Add foreign key constraints:
   - Creates foreign key constraints for the new `dataset_id` column in each table.
   - Links the `dataset_id` to the `id` column in the `datasets` table.

## Dependencies
This migration script assumes the existence of the following tables:
- `file_upload_completed_notifications`
- `topics`
- `messages`
- `datasets`

## Side Effects
- Existing tables are modified, which may affect current data and queries.
- New foreign key constraints are added, which will enforce referential integrity between the modified tables and the `datasets` table.

## Performance Considerations
- Adding a new NOT NULL column to existing tables with data may require careful handling, especially if the tables are large.
- The new foreign key constraints may impact the performance of insert and update operations on the modified tables.

## Error Handling
This script does not include explicit error handling. If any part of the migration fails, the database system will likely roll back the entire transaction.

## TODOs
- Ensure that existing data in the modified tables is updated with valid `dataset_id` values before or immediately after running this migration.
- Consider the impact on existing applications and queries that interact with these tables.
- Plan for a corresponding down migration to revert these changes if necessary.
