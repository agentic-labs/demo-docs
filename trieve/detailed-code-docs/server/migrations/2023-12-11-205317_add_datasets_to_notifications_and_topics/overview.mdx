## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for adding a `dataset_id` column to the `file_upload_completed_notifications`, `topics`, and `messages` tables in a database. The migration also establishes foreign key relationships between these tables and a `datasets` table. The directory includes both "up" and "down" migration scripts to apply and revert the changes, respectively.

## What does it do?
The migration scripts in this directory modify the database structure to associate notifications, topics, and messages with specific datasets. Here's what happens:

1. A new column called `dataset_id` is added to three tables: `file_upload_completed_notifications`, `topics`, and `messages`.
2. This new column is set up to store UUID values, which are unique identifiers for datasets.
3. The `dataset_id` column is marked as "NOT NULL", meaning it must always have a value.
4. Foreign key constraints are created to link the `dataset_id` in these tables to the `id` column in a `datasets` table. This ensures data integrity by preventing references to non-existent datasets.

If the changes need to be undone, the "down" migration script removes the `dataset_id` column and its associated foreign key constraints from the affected tables.

## Key Files

1. `up.sql`: This file contains the SQL commands to apply the migration. It adds the `dataset_id` column and creates foreign key constraints.

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE file_upload_completed_notifications
   ADD COLUMN dataset_id UUID NOT NULL,
   ADD CONSTRAINT notifications_dataset_id_fkey
   FOREIGN KEY (dataset_id) REFERENCES datasets(id);

   -- Similar alterations for 'topics' and 'messages' tables
   ```

2. `down.sql`: This file contains the SQL commands to revert the migration. It removes the foreign key constraints and drops the `dataset_id` column.

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE file_upload_completed_notifications
   DROP CONSTRAINT notifications_dataset_id_fkey,
   DROP COLUMN dataset_id;

   -- Similar reversions for 'topics' and 'messages' tables
   ```

## Dependencies
The migration scripts depend on the existence of the following database objects:
- Tables: `file_upload_completed_notifications`, `topics`, `messages`, and `datasets`
- The `id` column in the `datasets` table (referenced by the foreign key constraints)

## Configuration
These migration scripts do not require any specific configuration. However, they should be run using a database migration tool that can handle "up" and "down" migrations, such as Diesel for Rust applications or similar tools for other programming languages.

When applying these migrations, consider the following:
1. Ensure that the `datasets` table exists and has an `id` column of UUID type before running the "up" migration.
2. If the affected tables already contain data, you'll need to populate the new `dataset_id` column with valid values before or immediately after running the "up" migration, as it's defined as NOT NULL.
3. Be aware that the "down" migration will remove the `dataset_id` column, which could result in data loss if it contains important information.

## Side Effects and Performance Considerations
- Adding a new NOT NULL column to existing tables may require careful handling, especially if the tables are large.
- The new foreign key constraints may impact the performance of insert and update operations on the modified tables.
- Removing the `dataset_id` column in the "down" migration could potentially cause data loss if the column contains valuable information.

These migrations represent a significant change to the database schema, potentially affecting existing applications and queries that interact with the `file_upload_completed_notifications`, `topics`, and `messages` tables. It's crucial to update any code that works with these tables to handle the new `dataset_id` column appropriately.
