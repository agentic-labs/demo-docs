## High-level description
This SQL migration script is designed to undo the changes made in the corresponding `up.sql` file. It removes the `dataset_id` column and its associated foreign key constraints from the `file_upload_completed_notifications`, `topics`, and `messages` tables.

### SQL Commands

#### Description
The script consists of a series of SQL ALTER TABLE commands that remove foreign key constraints and drop columns related to `dataset_id` from three tables.

#### Internal Logic
1. Remove foreign key constraints:
   - Removes the `notifications_dataset_id_fkey` constraint from `file_upload_completed_notifications` table.
   - Removes the `topics_dataset_id_fkey` constraint from `topics` table.
   - Removes the `messages_dataset_id_fkey` constraint from `messages` table.

2. Drop columns:
   - Drops the `dataset_id` column from `file_upload_completed_notifications` table.
   - Drops the `dataset_id` column from `topics` table.
   - Drops the `dataset_id` column from `messages` table.

## Side Effects
- The `dataset_id` column will be removed from the specified tables, potentially causing data loss if the column contained any data.
- The foreign key relationships between these tables and the (assumed) `datasets` table will be removed, potentially affecting data integrity and relationships in the database.

## Dependencies
This script depends on the existence of the following database objects:
- Table: `file_upload_completed_notifications`
- Table: `topics`
- Table: `messages`
- Constraints: `notifications_dataset_id_fkey`, `topics_dataset_id_fkey`, `messages_dataset_id_fkey`

Note: The script assumes these objects exist in the database. If they don't, the script may fail to execute properly.

## Error Handling
This script does not include explicit error handling. If any of the ALTER TABLE commands fail (e.g., if a constraint or column doesn't exist), the database system will likely raise an error and stop execution.

## TODOs
The script includes a comment at the top:
```sql
-- This file should undo anything in `up.sql`
```
This serves as a reminder that this down migration should reverse all changes made in the corresponding `up.sql` file.
