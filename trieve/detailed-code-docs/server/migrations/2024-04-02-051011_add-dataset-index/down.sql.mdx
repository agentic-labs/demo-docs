## High-level description
This SQL script reverts the database migration defined in the corresponding `up.sql` file, specifically by removing indices added to the `chunk_metadata` table and recreating an index on the `qdrant_point_id` column. This suggests the migration likely involved changes to indexing strategy for the `chunk_metadata` table.

## Symbols

### `DROP INDEX idx_chunk_metadata_dataset_id;`
#### Description
