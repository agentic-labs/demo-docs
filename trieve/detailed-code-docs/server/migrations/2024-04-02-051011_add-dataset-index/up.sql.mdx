## High-level description
This SQL script defines a database migration that adds and removes indexes on the `chunk_metadata` table. The migration aims to improve query performance by creating indexes on `dataset_id`, `created_at`, and `time_stamp` columns.

## Symbols

### `idx_chunk_metadata_dataset_id`
#### Description
This statement creates an index on the `dataset_id` column of the `chunk_metadata` table. This index will likely speed up queries that filter or join on the `dataset_id` column.

#### Internal Logic
- `CREATE INDEX`: SQL command to create an index.
- `idx_chunk_metadata_dataset_id`: Name of the index being created.
- `ON chunk_metadata`: Specifies the table on which the index is created.
- `(dataset_id)`: Specifies the column on which the index is created.

### `idx_chunk_metadata_created_at`
#### Description
This statement creates an index on the `created_at` column of the `chunk_metadata` table. This index will likely speed up queries that filter or order by the `created_at` column.

#### Internal Logic
- `CREATE INDEX`: SQL command to create an index.
- `idx_chunk_metadata_created_at`: Name of the index being created.
- `ON chunk_metadata`: Specifies the table on which the index is created.
- `(created_at)`: Specifies the column on which the index is created.

### `idx_chunk_metadata_time_stamp`
#### Description
This statement creates an index on the `time_stamp` column of the `chunk_metadata` table. This index will likely speed up queries that filter or order by the `time_stamp` column.

#### Internal Logic
- `CREATE INDEX`: SQL command to create an index.
- `idx_chunk_metadata_time_stamp`: Name of the index being created.
- `ON chunk_metadata`: Specifies the table on which the index is created.
- `(time_stamp)`: Specifies the column on which the index is created.

### `idx_card_metadata_qdrant_point_id`
#### Description
This statement drops an existing index named `idx_card_metadata_qdrant_point_id`. This suggests that the index is no longer needed or will be replaced.

#### Internal Logic
- `DROP INDEX`: SQL command to delete an existing index.
- `idx_card_metadata_qdrant_point_id`: Name of the index to be dropped.
