## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for modifying the indexing strategy of the `chunk_metadata` table in the database. The migration adds new indexes to improve query performance for operations involving dataset IDs, creation timestamps, and specific time stamps, while removing an existing index on the `qdrant_point_id` column.

## What does it do?
The migration scripts in this directory perform the following actions:

1. In the "up" migration:
   - Add three new indexes to the `chunk_metadata` table:
     - An index on the `dataset_id` column
     - An index on the `created_at` column
     - An index on the `time_stamp` column
   - Remove an existing index on the `qdrant_point_id` column

2. In the "down" migration (reverting the changes):
   - Remove the three newly added indexes
   - Recreate the index on the `qdrant_point_id` column

These changes are likely intended to optimize database performance for queries that frequently filter or sort by dataset IDs, creation times, or specific timestamps, while potentially reducing the importance of queries based on the `qdrant_point_id` column.

## Key Files

### up.sql
This file contains the SQL statements to apply the new indexing strategy:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_chunk_metadata_dataset_id ON chunk_metadata(dataset_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_chunk_metadata_created_at ON chunk_metadata(created_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_chunk_metadata_time_stamp ON chunk_metadata(time_stamp);
DROP INDEX idx_card_metadata_qdrant_point_id;
```

### down.sql
This file contains the SQL statements to revert the changes made by the up migration:

```sql
DROP INDEX idx_chunk_metadata_dataset_id;
DROP INDEX idx_chunk_metadata_created_at;
DROP INDEX idx_chunk_metadata_time_stamp;
CREATE INDEX idx_card_metadata_qdrant_point_id ON chunk_metadata(qdrant_point_id);
```

## Configuration
The migration is identified by its timestamp: 2024-04-02-051011. This timestamp is used to order migrations and ensure they are applied in the correct sequence.
