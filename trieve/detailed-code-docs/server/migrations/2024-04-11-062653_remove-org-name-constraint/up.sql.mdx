## High-level description
This SQL script removes the uniqueness constraint on the `name` column in the `organizations` table. This allows multiple organizations to have the same name.

### `ALTER TABLE organizations DROP CONSTRAINT organizations_name_key;`
#### Description
This SQL statement removes the unique constraint named `organizations_name_key` from the `organizations` table. 

#### Internal Logic
1. **`ALTER TABLE organizations`**: This part specifies that the `organizations` table is being modified.
2. **`DROP CONSTRAINT organizations_name_key`**: This part instructs the database to remove the constraint named `organizations_name_key`. This constraint likely enforces the uniqueness of the `name` column in the `organizations` table.

#### Side Effects
- After running this migration, the `name` column in the `organizations` table will no longer have a uniqueness constraint. This means multiple rows can have the same value for the `name` column.
