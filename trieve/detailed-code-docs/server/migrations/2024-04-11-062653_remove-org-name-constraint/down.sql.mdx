## High-level description
This SQL migration file is designed to revert the changes made in the corresponding `up.sql` file. It adds a unique constraint to the `name` column of the `organizations` table, ensuring that organization names are unique across the database.

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE organizations ADD CONSTRAINT organizations_name_key UNIQUE (name)
#### Description
This SQL statement adds a unique constraint to the `name` column of the `organizations` table. The constraint is named `organizations_name_key`.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `ALTER TABLE` command is used to modify the existing `organizations` table.
2. `ADD CONSTRAINT` clause is used to add a new constraint to the table.
3. The constraint is named `organizations_name_key`.
4. `UNIQUE (name)` specifies that the `name` column should contain only unique values across all rows in the table.

## Side Effects
- After executing this migration, no two organizations in the database can have the same name.
- Any attempt to insert or update an organization with a name that already exists in the table will result in a constraint violation error.
- This may impact application logic that relies on the ability to have multiple organizations with the same name.

## Dependencies
This migration file depends on:
1. The existence of the `organizations` table in the database.
2. The presence of a `name` column in the `organizations` table.

## Error Handling
No explicit error handling is implemented in this migration. However, if the `organizations` table or the `name` column does not exist, or if there are already duplicate names in the table, the database system will likely raise an error when attempting to apply this migration.

## TODOs
The comment at the top of the file suggests that this migration is intended to undo changes made in an `up.sql` file. It's important to ensure that this `down.sql` file correctly reverses all changes made in the corresponding `up.sql` file to maintain consistency in the database schema versioning.
