## High-level description
This SQL migration script reverts a change made in a previous migration, specifically by re-adding a unique constraint on the `name` column of the `organizations` table. This ensures that organization names remain unique within the database.

## Symbols

### `ALTER TABLE organizations ADD CONSTRAINT organizations_name_key UNIQUE (name)`
#### Description
This SQL statement modifies the `organizations` table by adding a unique constraint named `organizations_name_key` on the `name` column. 

#### Internal Logic
- **`ALTER TABLE organizations`**: This clause specifies that the `organizations` table is being modified.
- **`ADD CONSTRAINT organizations_name_key UNIQUE (name)`**: This clause adds a new constraint to the table.
    - `ADD CONSTRAINT`: This keyword signifies the addition of a new constraint.
    - `organizations_name_key`: This is the name assigned to the new constraint.
    - `UNIQUE (name)`: This defines the type and target of the constraint. `UNIQUE` ensures that all values in the `name` column are unique.

#### Side Effects
- Re-enforces the uniqueness of organization names within the database. Any attempt to insert or update a row with a duplicate organization name will result in a database error.
