## High-level description
This SQL migration script adds a new column called `tracking_id` to the `card_metadata` table. The new column is of type TEXT and has a UNIQUE constraint, ensuring that each entry in this column must have a distinct value across all rows in the table.

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE card_metadata
#### Description
This SQL command modifies the structure of the existing `card_metadata` table by adding a new column.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `ALTER TABLE` statement is used to modify an existing table.
2. `card_metadata` is the name of the table being altered.
3. `ADD COLUMN` specifies that a new column is being added to the table.
4. `tracking_id TEXT UNIQUE` defines the new column:
   - `tracking_id` is the name of the new column.
   - `TEXT` is the data type of the column, allowing for variable-length character strings.
   - `UNIQUE` is a constraint that ensures each value in this column must be unique across all rows in the table.

## Side Effects
- This migration will modify the structure of the `card_metadata` table in the database.
- Any existing rows in the `card_metadata` table will have a NULL value for the new `tracking_id` column unless a default value is specified (which is not the case in this migration).
- The UNIQUE constraint on the `tracking_id` column will prevent duplicate values from being inserted into this column in the future.

## Performance Considerations
- Adding a new column to an existing table with a UNIQUE constraint may have performance implications, especially if the table contains a large number of rows.
- The database will need to create an index to enforce the UNIQUE constraint, which could take some time for large tables.

## TODOs
The comment "-- Your SQL goes here" at the beginning of the file suggests that this might be a template or placeholder for SQL migrations. In a production environment, it's recommended to remove or replace such comments with more specific documentation about the purpose of this particular migration.
