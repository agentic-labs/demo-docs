## High-level description
This SQL migration script adds a new column called `tracking_id` to the `card_metadata` table. The new column is of type TEXT and has a UNIQUE constraint, ensuring that each entry in this column must have a distinct value.

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE card_metadata
#### Description
This SQL command modifies the structure of the existing `card_metadata` table by adding a new column.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `ALTER TABLE` statement is used to modify an existing table.
2. `card_metadata` is the name of the table being altered.
3. `ADD COLUMN` specifies that a new column is being added to the table.
4. `tracking_id TEXT UNIQUE` defines the new column:
   - `tracking_id` is the name of the new column.
   - `TEXT` is the data type of the column, allowing for variable-length character strings.
   - `UNIQUE` is a constraint that ensures each value in this column must be unique across all rows in the table.

## Side Effects
- This migration will modify the structure of the `card_metadata` table in the database.
- Any existing rows in the `card_metadata` table will have a NULL value for the new `tracking_id` column unless a default value is specified (which is not the case in this migration).
- The UNIQUE constraint on the `tracking_id` column will prevent duplicate values from being inserted into this column in the future.

## Performance Considerations
- Adding a new column to an existing table with a UNIQUE constraint may have performance implications, especially if the table contains a large number of rows.
- The database will need to create an index to enforce the UNIQUE constraint, which could take some time for large tables.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in this migration script. However, it's worth noting that:
1. No default value is provided for the new `tracking_id` column. Depending on the application's requirements, you might want to consider adding a default value or populating the column for existing rows in a separate migration or application logic.
2. The migration doesn't specify a NOT NULL constraint. If `tracking_id` is intended to be a required field, you might want to add this constraint in this or a future migration.
