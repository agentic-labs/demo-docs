## High-level description
This SQL migration file is designed to revert the changes made in the corresponding `up.sql` file. It removes the `tracking_id` column from the `card_metadata` table in the database.

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE card_metadata
#### Description
This SQL command modifies the structure of the `card_metadata` table by removing a column.

#### Internal Logic
The command drops the `tracking_id` column from the `card_metadata` table. This operation will permanently remove the column and all data stored in it.

## Side Effects
- The `tracking_id` column will be removed from the `card_metadata` table.
- Any data stored in the `tracking_id` column will be permanently lost.
- Any queries or application code that relied on the `tracking_id` column will need to be updated to avoid errors.

## Performance Considerations
Dropping a column is generally a fast operation, but it may lock the table briefly. The impact depends on the size of the table and the database system being used. For large tables, it's recommended to perform this operation during low-traffic periods.

## Error Handling
This SQL command does not include explicit error handling. If the `tracking_id` column doesn't exist, the database will likely raise an error. It's important to ensure that this migration is only run when reverting from a state where the `tracking_id` column exists.

## TODOs
The comment at the top of the file, `-- This file should undo anything in `up.sql``, serves as a reminder and documentation for developers. It indicates that this `down.sql` file is intended to reverse the changes made by the corresponding `up.sql` file in the same migration.
