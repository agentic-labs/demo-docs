## High-level description
This SQL migration file is designed to revert the changes made by the corresponding `up.sql` file. It removes the `dataset_id` column from the `files` table if it exists.

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE files DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS dataset_id
#### Description
This SQL statement removes the `dataset_id` column from the `files` table, but only if the column exists. This is a defensive approach to ensure that the migration can be run safely even if the column has already been removed or never existed.

#### Internal Logic
1. The statement targets the `files` table.
2. It attempts to drop the `dataset_id` column.
3. The `IF EXISTS` clause prevents an error if the column doesn't exist, making the migration idempotent.

## Side Effects
- If the `dataset_id` column exists in the `files` table, it will be permanently removed along with all data it contains.
- If the column doesn't exist, the statement will have no effect on the table structure.

## Performance Considerations
This operation may lock the `files` table briefly during the column removal, which could impact concurrent operations on the table. The performance impact will depend on the size of the table and the database system being used.

## Error Handling
The `IF EXISTS` clause provides basic error handling by preventing the migration from failing if the column doesn't exist. However, other potential errors (like permission issues) are not explicitly handled in this script and would likely cause the migration to fail.
