title: "down.sql"

## High-level description
This SQL migration file is designed to revert the changes made by the corresponding `up.sql` file. It removes the `dataset_id` column from the `files` table if it exists.

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE files DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS dataset_id
#### Description
This SQL statement removes the `dataset_id` column from the `files` table, but only if the column exists. This ensures that the migration can be safely run even if the column has already been removed or never existed.

#### Internal Logic
1. The statement targets the `files` table.
2. It attempts to drop the `dataset_id` column.
3. The `IF EXISTS` clause prevents an error if the column doesn't exist, making the migration idempotent.

## Side Effects
- If the `dataset_id` column exists in the `files` table, it will be permanently removed along with all data it contains.
- The schema of the `files` table will be modified.
- Any queries, views, or application code that relied on the `dataset_id` column will need to be updated to reflect this change.

## Performance Considerations
Dropping a column is generally a quick operation, but it may lock the table briefly. The impact should be minimal unless the `files` table is very large or under heavy use during the migration.

## Dependencies
This migration relies on the database system supporting the `ALTER TABLE` and `DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS` syntax, which is standard in most modern SQL databases.

## Error Handling
The `IF EXISTS` clause provides basic error handling by preventing the migration from failing if the column doesn't exist. However, other potential errors (like permission issues) are not explicitly handled and would cause the migration to fail.

## TODOs
The comment at the top of the file, "This file should undo anything in `up.sql`", serves as a reminder and documentation for developers. It implies that there's a corresponding `up.sql` file that added the `dataset_id` column, and this `down.sql` file is intended to reverse that change.
