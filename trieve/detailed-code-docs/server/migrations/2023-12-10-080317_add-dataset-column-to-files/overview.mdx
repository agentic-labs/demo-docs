## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for adding a new `dataset_id` column to the `files` table in a database schema. The migration is designed to establish a relationship between the `files` table and a `datasets` table, allowing each file to be associated with a specific dataset.

## What does it do?
The migration performs the following actions:

1. Adds a new column called `dataset_id` to the `files` table. This column is of type UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) and is set as NOT NULL, meaning every file must be associated with a dataset.

2. Creates a foreign key constraint on the `dataset_id` column in the `files` table, referencing the `id` column in the `datasets` table. This ensures referential integrity between the two tables.

3. Provides a way to revert these changes by removing the `dataset_id` column from the `files` table if needed.

These changes allow the system to track which dataset each file belongs to, enabling better organization and management of files within the context of datasets.

## Key Files

### up.sql
This file contains the SQL commands to apply the migration:

```sql
ALTER TABLE files ADD COLUMN dataset_id UUID NOT NULL;
ALTER TABLE files ADD CONSTRAINT files_dataset_id_fkey FOREIGN KEY (dataset_id) REFERENCES datasets(id);
```

The first command adds the `dataset_id` column to the `files` table, while the second command establishes the foreign key relationship with the `datasets` table.

### down.sql
This file contains the SQL command to revert the migration:

```sql
ALTER TABLE files DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS dataset_id;
```

This command removes the `dataset_id` column from the `files` table if it exists, effectively undoing the changes made by the `up.sql` script.

## Dependencies
This migration assumes the existence of two tables:

1. `files`: The table being modified to include the new `dataset_id` column.
2. `datasets`: The table referenced by the new foreign key constraint. It must have an `id` column of type UUID.

## Configuration
No specific configuration files or environment variables are used in this migration. However, the migration system (likely Diesel, based on the file naming convention) may require configuration to connect to the database and apply these migrations.

## Side Effects
Applying this migration will have the following effects:

1. The structure of the `files` table will be modified, adding a new column.
2. A new relationship will be established between the `files` and `datasets` tables.
3. Existing rows in the `files` table (if any) will need to have a valid `dataset_id` assigned, as the new column is set to NOT NULL. This may require additional data manipulation not covered in these migration scripts.

## Performance Considerations
1. Adding a new NOT NULL column to an existing table with data can be a time-consuming operation, especially for large tables. The database may need to rewrite the entire table to accommodate the new column.
2. The new foreign key constraint may slightly impact the performance of insert and update operations on the `files` table, as the database will need to check the `datasets` table for each operation to ensure referential integrity.
3. The `down.sql` script uses the `IF EXISTS` clause when dropping the column, making it safe to run multiple times without causing errors.

## Error Handling
The migration scripts do not include explicit error handling. However, the database system will enforce the following:

1. It will prevent the addition of the `dataset_id` column if a column with the same name already exists in the `files` table.
2. It will enforce the NOT NULL constraint on the `dataset_id` column.
3. It will enforce referential integrity through the foreign key constraint, ensuring that every `dataset_id` in the `files` table corresponds to a valid `id` in the `datasets` table.
4. The `down.sql` script uses `IF EXISTS` to prevent errors if the column has already been removed.

Any other errors, such as permission issues or database connectivity problems, are not handled by these scripts and would likely cause the migration to fail.

In conclusion, this migration enhances the database schema by creating a direct relationship between files and datasets, improving data organization and integrity within the system.
