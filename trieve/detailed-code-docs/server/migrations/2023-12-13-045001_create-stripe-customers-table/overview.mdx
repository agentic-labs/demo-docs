## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for creating and managing a `stripe_customers` table and modifying the `users` table in a database. The migration is dated 2023-12-13 and is designed to establish a link between users and their corresponding Stripe customer information, ensuring data integrity and uniqueness.

## What does it do?
The migration scripts in this directory perform the following actions:

1. In the "up" migration:
   - Adds a unique constraint to the `email` column in the existing `users` table.
   - Creates a new `stripe_customers` table with columns for id, stripe_id, email, created_at, and updated_at.
   - Sets up constraints in the `stripe_customers` table, including primary key, unique constraints, and a foreign key relationship with the `users` table.

2. In the "down" migration:
   - Removes the unique constraint on the `email` column in the `users` table.
   - Drops the `stripe_customers` table if it exists.

These actions allow the application to store and manage Stripe customer information separately from the main user data while maintaining data integrity between the two tables.

## Key Files

1. `up.sql`:
   This file contains the SQL commands to create the new `stripe_customers` table and add the unique constraint to the `users` table. It's responsible for setting up the new structure and relationships in the database.

2. `down.sql`:
   This file contains the SQL commands to revert the changes made by `up.sql`. It removes the unique constraint from the `users` table and drops the `stripe_customers` table.

## Configuration
The migration scripts use standard SQL commands and do not require additional configuration. However, they assume the existence of a `users` table with an `email` column in the database.

Key configurable elements in the scripts include:

- Table name: `stripe_customers`
- Columns in `stripe_customers`:
  - `id` (UUID, primary key)
  - `stripe_id` (text, unique)
  - `email` (text, unique, foreign key to `users.email`)
  - `created_at` (timestamp)
  - `updated_at` (timestamp)
- Constraint name on `users` table: `users_email_unique`

When applying these migrations, ensure that the database user has the necessary permissions to create tables, add constraints, and modify existing tables.

## Dependencies
These migration scripts don't rely on any external libraries or modules. They use standard SQL commands that are compatible with most relational database management systems. However, they do depend on:

1. The existence of a `users` table with an `email` column in the database.
2. Support for UUID data type in the database system.
3. Support for timestamp data type in the database system.

## Performance Considerations
While the operations in these migration scripts are generally fast, there are some performance considerations:

1. Adding a unique constraint to the `users.email` column may take longer if the table contains a large number of rows, as the database needs to verify the uniqueness of all existing entries.

2. If the `users` table is large and frequently accessed, adding the unique constraint might temporarily impact the performance of operations involving the `email` column.

3. Dropping the `stripe_customers` table in the down migration could be resource-intensive if the table contains a large amount of data.

It's recommended to run these migrations during low-traffic periods to minimize potential disruptions to the application's performance.

## Error Handling
The migration scripts include some basic error handling:

1. In the down migration, the `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS` clause prevents errors if the `stripe_customers` table doesn't exist.

2. The unique constraints and foreign key relationships defined in the up migration will prevent data inconsistencies, such as duplicate email addresses or orphaned Stripe customer records.

However, there are some scenarios that could lead to errors:

1. The up migration might fail if there are existing duplicate email addresses in the `users` table when trying to add the unique constraint.

2. The down migration doesn't include error handling for removing the `users_email_unique` constraint. If this constraint doesn't exist or if there are dependent objects, the migration could fail.

To mitigate these risks, it's advisable to:

1. Check for and resolve any duplicate email addresses in the `users` table before running the up migration.
2. Ensure there are no dependencies on the `users_email_unique` constraint before running the down migration.
3. Test the migrations in a staging environment that closely mirrors the production database to identify and resolve any potential issues before applying them to the production system.
