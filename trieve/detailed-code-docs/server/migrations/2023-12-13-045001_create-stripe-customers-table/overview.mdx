## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for creating and managing a `stripe_customers` table in the database. The migration is designed to integrate Stripe customer data with the existing user system, establishing a relationship between users and their corresponding Stripe customer information.

## What does it do?
The migration scripts in this directory perform the following tasks:

1. Add a unique constraint to the `email` column in the existing `users` table.
2. Create a new `stripe_customers` table to store Stripe-specific customer information.
3. Establish a foreign key relationship between the `stripe_customers` table and the `users` table using the `email` column.
4. Provide a rollback mechanism to undo these changes if needed.

These changes allow the application to associate Stripe customer data with user accounts, enabling seamless integration of Stripe's payment processing capabilities with the existing user management system.

## Key Files

### up.sql
This file contains the SQL commands to apply the migration:

```sql
ALTER TABLE users
ADD CONSTRAINT users_email_unique UNIQUE (email);

CREATE TABLE stripe_customers (
    id UUID NOT NULL UNIQUE PRIMARY KEY,
    stripe_id TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    email TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (email) REFERENCES users(email)
);
```

The script first adds a unique constraint to the `email` column in the `users` table. Then, it creates the `stripe_customers` table with the following columns:
- `id`: A UUID primary key
- `stripe_id`: A unique identifier for the Stripe customer
- `email`: The customer's email address (linked to the `users` table)
- `created_at` and `updated_at`: Timestamps for record creation and updates

The `email` column in `stripe_customers` is set as a foreign key referencing the `email` column in the `users` table, ensuring data integrity between the two tables.

### down.sql
This file contains the SQL commands to revert the migration:

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS stripe_customers;
ALTER TABLE users DROP CONSTRAINT users_email_unique;
```

The script first drops the `stripe_customers` table if it exists, then removes the unique constraint on the `email` column in the `users` table. This effectively undoes the changes made by the `up.sql` script, allowing for a clean rollback of the migration if necessary.

## Configuration
The migration is identified by its timestamp: `2023-12-13-045001`. This timestamp ensures that migrations are applied in the correct order and helps prevent conflicts when multiple developers are working on different database changes.

To apply this migration, you would typically use a database migration tool or ORM that supports SQL migrations. The exact command would depend on the tool being used, but it might look something like this:

```
diesel migration run
```

To roll back the migration:

```
diesel migration revert
```

## Dependencies
This migration doesn't explicitly depend on external libraries, but it assumes the existence of a database system that supports SQL operations, particularly:

1. UUID data type
2. Timestamp data type
3. Foreign key constraints

The migration is likely designed to work with PostgreSQL, given the use of UUIDs and the specific syntax for constraints and table creation.

In terms of application dependencies, this migration implies the use of Stripe for payment processing, as evidenced by the `stripe_id` column in the `stripe_customers` table.

## Entry points
There are two main entry points for this migration:

1. `up.sql`: This is the primary script that applies the changes to the database schema. It should be run when updating the database to include Stripe customer integration.

2. `down.sql`: This is the rollback script that reverts the changes made by `up.sql`. It should be run if you need to undo the Stripe customer integration.

The migration system (likely Diesel, based on the file naming convention) will determine which script to run based on whether you're applying or reverting the migration.

In terms of data flow, the migration establishes a one-to-one relationship between users and Stripe customers:

1. Each user in the `users` table can have at most one corresponding entry in the `stripe_customers` table.
2. Each entry in the `stripe_customers` table must correspond to an existing user in the `users` table.

This structure allows the application to easily associate Stripe-specific information with user accounts while maintaining data integrity and avoiding duplication of user data.
