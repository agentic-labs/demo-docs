## High-level description
This SQL script handles the database migration rollback for removing the Stripe customer integration feature. It drops the `stripe_customers` table and removes the unique constraint on the `email` column in the `users` table.

## Symbols

### `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS stripe_customers;`
#### Description
This statement attempts to drop the `stripe_customers` table. The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the statement executes successfully even if the table doesn't exist. This is important for rollback operations, as the table might not be present if the migration failed during the `up.sql` execution.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Check for existence:** The database checks if a table named `stripe_customers` exists.
2. **Conditional drop:**
   - If the table exists, it is dropped from the database.
   - If the table doesn't exist, no action is taken.

### `ALTER TABLE users DROP CONSTRAINT users_email_unique;`
#### Description
This statement removes the uniqueness constraint on the `email` column in the `users` table. This likely reverses a change made in the `up.sql` migration where the email was made unique to potentially serve as a foreign key reference for the `stripe_customers` table.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Identify constraint:** The database identifies the constraint named `users_email_unique` on the `users` table.
2. **Remove constraint:** The constraint is removed, allowing duplicate email addresses in the `users` table.
