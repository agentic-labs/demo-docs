## High-level description
This SQL migration script is designed to undo the changes made by the corresponding `up.sql` file. It removes a unique constraint on the `email` column in the `users` table and drops the `stripe_customers` table if it exists.

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE users DROP CONSTRAINT users_email_unique
#### Description
This SQL command removes the unique constraint named `users_email_unique` from the `users` table.

#### Internal Logic
1. Identifies the `users` table.
2. Removes the constraint named `users_email_unique`, which was likely enforcing uniqueness on the `email` column.

### DROP TABLE IF EXISTS stripe_customers
#### Description
This SQL command drops (deletes) the `stripe_customers` table if it exists in the database.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if a table named `stripe_customers` exists in the database.
2. If the table exists, it is completely removed from the database schema.
3. If the table doesn't exist, the command does nothing, preventing errors.

## Side Effects
- Removes the unique constraint on the `email` column in the `users` table, potentially allowing duplicate email addresses.
- Deletes the entire `stripe_customers` table and all its data if it exists.

## Dependencies
This migration script doesn't rely on any external libraries or modules. It uses standard SQL commands that are compatible with most relational database management systems.

## Error Handling
The script uses the `IF EXISTS` clause in the `DROP TABLE` statement to prevent errors if the `stripe_customers` table doesn't exist. However, there's no explicit error handling for the `ALTER TABLE` statement, so it may fail if the constraint doesn't exist or if there are dependent objects.

## Performance Considerations
Dropping a table and removing a constraint are generally fast operations, but the impact could be significant if:
1. The `stripe_customers` table contains a large amount of data.
2. There are foreign key constraints or indexes related to the `users_email_unique` constraint.

It's advisable to run this migration during low-traffic periods to minimize potential disruptions.
