## High-level description
This SQL script defines a database migration that adds a unique constraint to the `users` table on the `email` column and creates a new table named `stripe_customers`. The `stripe_customers` table is designed to store information about Stripe customers and their association with users in the `users` table through a foreign key relationship on the `email` column.

## Code Structure
The script first alters the existing `users` table to add a unique constraint. Then, it creates the `stripe_customers` table with a foreign key referencing the `email` column in the `users` table.

## Symbols

### `ALTER TABLE users`
#### Description
This statement modifies the existing `users` table to add a unique constraint on the `email` column. This ensures that each email address in the `users` table is unique.

#### Internal Logic
- `ALTER TABLE users`: Specifies that the `users` table is being modified.
- `ADD CONSTRAINT users_email_unique UNIQUE (email)`: Adds a new constraint named `users_email_unique` that enforces the uniqueness of values in the `email` column.

### `CREATE TABLE stripe_customers`
#### Description
This statement creates a new table named `stripe_customers` to store information about Stripe customers.

#### Internal Logic
- `CREATE TABLE stripe_customers`: Specifies that a new table named `stripe_customers` is being created.
- `id UUID NOT NULL UNIQUE PRIMARY KEY`: Defines the `id` column as a UUID, not nullable, unique, and the primary key of the table.
- `stripe_id TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE`: Defines the `stripe_id` column as text, not nullable, and unique. This column likely stores the unique identifier of the customer within the Stripe platform.
- `email TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE`: Defines the `email` column as text, not nullable, and unique. This column stores the email address of the Stripe customer.
- `created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL`: Defines the `created_at` column as a timestamp, not nullable. This column likely stores the timestamp of when the record was created.
- `updated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL`: Defines the `updated_at` column as a timestamp, not nullable. This column likely stores the timestamp of when the record was last updated.
- `FOREIGN KEY (email) REFERENCES users(email)`: Defines a foreign key constraint on the `email` column, referencing the `email` column in the `users` table. This ensures that the `email` value in the `stripe_customers` table must exist in the `users` table, establishing a relationship between users and their corresponding Stripe customer data.
