## High-level description
This SQL script migrates the database schema to introduce a new table `user_organizations` for managing relationships between users and organizations. It also removes the `organization_id` column from the `users` table, indicating a shift from a one-to-one to a many-to-many relationship between users and organizations.

## Symbols
### `ALTER TABLE users DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS organization_id;`
#### Description
This statement removes the `organization_id` column from the `users` table if it exists. This suggests a change in the database schema where users are no longer directly associated with a single organization.

#### Internal Logic
- It uses `DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS` to avoid errors if the column doesn't exist, making the migration more robust.

### `CREATE TABLE user_organizations`
#### Description
This statement creates a new table named `user_organizations` to store the relationships between users and organizations.

#### Inputs
N/A - This statement defines a table structure, it doesn't take inputs.

#### Outputs
N/A - This statement performs a database operation, it doesn't return outputs.

#### Internal Logic
- It defines the table structure with columns for:
    - `id`: Unique identifier for each user-organization relationship.
    - `user_id`: Foreign key referencing the `users` table.
    - `organization_id`: Foreign key referencing the `organizations` table.
    - `role`: Integer value likely representing the user's role within the organization.
    - `created_at`: Timestamp indicating when the relationship was created.
    - `updated_at`: Timestamp indicating when the relationship was last updated.
- It sets `id` as the primary key, ensuring each row has a unique identifier.
- It uses `NOT NULL` constraints to enforce data integrity for essential columns.

### `ALTER TABLE user_organizations ADD CONSTRAINT fk_user_id FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users (id);`
#### Description
This statement adds a foreign key constraint to the `user_organizations` table, linking the `user_id` column to the `id` column of the `users` table.

#### Internal Logic
- It uses `ADD CONSTRAINT` to define a new foreign key constraint named `fk_user_id`.
- The constraint ensures that every `user_id` in `user_organizations` corresponds to a valid `id` in the `users` table, maintaining referential integrity.

### `ALTER TABLE user_organizations ADD CONSTRAINT fk_organization_id FOREIGN KEY (organization_id) REFERENCES organizations (id);`
#### Description
This statement adds a foreign key constraint to the `user_organizations` table, linking the `organization_id` column to the `id` column of the `organizations` table.

#### Internal Logic
- It uses `ADD CONSTRAINT` to define a new foreign key constraint named `fk_organization_id`.
- The constraint ensures that every `organization_id` in `user_organizations` corresponds to a valid `id` in the `organizations` table, maintaining referential integrity.
