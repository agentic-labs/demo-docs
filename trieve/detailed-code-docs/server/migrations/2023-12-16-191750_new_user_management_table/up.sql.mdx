## High-level description
This SQL migration file creates a new table `user_organizations` to manage user-organization relationships and removes the `organization_id` column from the `users` table. This change allows for a many-to-many relationship between users and organizations, enabling users to belong to multiple organizations with different roles.

## Code Structure
The migration consists of three main parts:
1. Dropping the `organization_id` column from the `users` table
2. Creating the new `user_organizations` table
3. Adding foreign key constraints to the `user_organizations` table

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE users DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS organization_id;
#### Description
This statement removes the `organization_id` column from the `users` table if it exists. This is likely done to prepare for the new many-to-many relationship structure.

### CREATE TABLE user_organizations
#### Description
This statement creates a new table called `user_organizations` to manage the relationships between users and organizations.

#### Internal Logic
The table is created with the following columns:
- `id`: A unique UUID primary key
- `user_id`: UUID of the user
- `organization_id`: UUID of the organization
- `role`: An integer representing the user's role in the organization
- `created_at`: Timestamp of when the relationship was created
- `updated_at`: Timestamp of when the relationship was last updated

### ALTER TABLE user_organizations ADD CONSTRAINT
#### Description
These statements add foreign key constraints to the `user_organizations` table.

#### Internal Logic
Two constraints are added:
1. `fk_user_id`: Links the `user_id` column to the `id` column in the `users` table
2. `fk_organization_id`: Links the `organization_id` column to the `id` column in the `organizations` table

## Side Effects
- The `users` table will no longer have a direct link to a single organization.
- Users can now be associated with multiple organizations through the `user_organizations` table.
- Existing code that relies on the `organization_id` column in the `users` table will need to be updated to use the new `user_organizations` table.

## Performance Considerations
- Queries involving user-organization relationships may become more complex and potentially slower, as they now require joining with the `user_organizations` table.
- The `user_organizations` table may grow large for systems with many users and organizations, so proper indexing should be considered for performance optimization.

## References
This migration file is likely related to the `user_operator.rs` file, which contains functions for managing users and their relationships with organizations. The new table structure aligns with functions like `add_existing_user_to_org`, `update_user_org_role_query`, and `remove_user_from_org_query` in the related code snippet.
