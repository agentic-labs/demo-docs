## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for implementing a new user management system in the database. The migration introduces a many-to-many relationship between users and organizations, replacing a previous one-to-one relationship. The directory includes two files: `up.sql` for applying the changes and `down.sql` for rolling them back.

## What does it do?
The migration accomplishes the following:

1. It removes the direct association between users and organizations by dropping the `organization_id` column from the `users` table.
2. It creates a new `user_organizations` table to manage the relationships between users and organizations. This table allows a user to be associated with multiple organizations and vice versa.
3. It sets up foreign key constraints to ensure data integrity between the `user_organizations` table and the `users` and `organizations` tables.
4. It includes fields for tracking when these relationships are created and updated, as well as a role field to define a user's role within an organization.

The rollback script (`down.sql`) reverses these changes, allowing the database to be returned to its previous state if needed.

## Key Files

### up.sql
This file contains the SQL commands to implement the new user management system. Here's a breakdown of its main operations:

1. Remove the `organization_id` column from the `users` table:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE users DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS organization_id;
   ```

2. Create the new `user_organizations` table:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE user_organizations (
       id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
       user_id UUID NOT NULL,
       organization_id UUID NOT NULL,
       role INTEGER NOT NULL,
       created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
       updated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL
   );
   ```

3. Add foreign key constraints:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE user_organizations ADD CONSTRAINT fk_user_id FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users (id);
   ALTER TABLE user_organizations ADD CONSTRAINT fk_organization_id FOREIGN KEY (organization_id) REFERENCES organizations (id);
   ```

### down.sql
This file contains the SQL commands to revert the changes made by `up.sql`:

1. Drop the foreign key constraints:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE user_organizations DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS fk_user_id;
   ALTER TABLE user_organizations DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS fk_organization_id;
   ```

2. Drop the `user_organizations` table:
   ```sql
   DROP TABLE IF EXISTS user_organizations;
   ```

3. Add back the `organization_id` column to the `users` table:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS organization_id UUID;
   ```

## Configuration
This migration doesn't require any specific configuration files or environment variables. However, it assumes the existence of `users` and `organizations` tables in the database.

The `user_organizations` table uses UUID types for `id`, `user_id`, and `organization_id` fields, which suggests that the application is using UUIDs for primary keys across these tables.

The `role` field in the `user_organizations` table is defined as an INTEGER. This implies that the application might use integer values to represent different roles, which should be documented elsewhere in the application code or documentation.
