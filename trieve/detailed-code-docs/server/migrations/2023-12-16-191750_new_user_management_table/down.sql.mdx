## High-level description
This SQL migration script is designed to revert the changes made in the corresponding `up.sql` file. It removes the `user_organizations` table and restores the `organization_id` column in the `users` table, effectively undoing a transition to a many-to-many relationship between users and organizations.

### SQL Commands

#### Description
This migration script consists of a series of SQL commands that perform the following actions:
1. Remove foreign key constraints from the `user_organizations` table.
2. Drop the `user_organizations` table.
3. Add the `organization_id` column back to the `users` table.

#### Internal Logic
1. The script first removes foreign key constraints (`fk_user_id` and `fk_organization_id`) from the `user_organizations` table if they exist. This is done to ensure that the table can be dropped without violating any referential integrity constraints.

2. It then drops the `user_organizations` table entirely, removing the many-to-many relationship structure.

3. Finally, it adds the `organization_id` column of type UUID back to the `users` table, reverting to a one-to-many relationship between organizations and users.

## Side Effects
- Removes the `user_organizations` table, which may result in loss of data if not handled properly in the application logic.
- Modifies the structure of the `users` table by adding the `organization_id` column.
- Changes the relationship model between users and organizations from many-to-many back to one-to-many.

## Error Handling
The script uses `IF EXISTS` and `IF NOT EXISTS` clauses to prevent errors if the constraints or tables do not exist or if the column already exists. This makes the migration more robust and idempotent.

## Notes
- This migration script should be used with caution, as it may result in data loss if not properly coordinated with application-level data migration.
- The script assumes that the previous state of the database had a direct `organization_id` column in the `users` table, representing a one-to-many relationship between organizations and users.
- It's important to ensure that any data in the `user_organizations` table is appropriately handled or migrated before running this down migration in a production environment.
