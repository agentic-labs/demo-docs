## High-level description
This SQL script handles the database migration rollback for changes related to user management. It aims to revert the database schema to its state before the migration defined in the corresponding `up.sql` file.

## Symbols
### `down.sql`
#### Description
This script undoes the changes introduced by the `up.sql` migration script, specifically reverting alterations related to user and organization relationships.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Drop Foreign Key Constraints:**
    - `ALTER TABLE user_organizations DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS fk_user_id;`: Removes the foreign key constraint `fk_user_id` from the `user_organizations` table if it exists. This constraint likely enforced the relationship between `user_organizations` and a `users` table.
    - `ALTER TABLE user_organizations DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS fk_organization_id;`: Removes the foreign key constraint `fk_organization_id` from the `user_organizations` table if it exists. This constraint likely enforced the relationship between `user_organizations` and an `organizations` table.

2. **Drop the `user_organizations` Table:**
    - `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS user_organizations;`: Deletes the `user_organizations` table if it exists. This table likely represented the association between users and organizations.

3. **Add `organization_id` Column to `users` Table:**
    - `ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS organization_id UUID;`: Adds a column named `organization_id` of type `UUID` to the `users` table if it doesn't already exist. This suggests that the migration being rolled back might have moved the organization association directly into the `users` table.
