## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for creating and managing a `user_collection_counts` table in a database. The migration introduces a new table to track the number of collections each user has, along with a trigger mechanism to keep this count updated automatically.

## What does it do?
The migration scripts in this directory perform the following tasks:

1. Create a new table called `user_collection_counts` to store the number of collections for each user.
2. Set up a trigger system that automatically updates the collection count whenever changes occur in the `card_collection` table.
3. Initialize the `user_collection_counts` table with existing data from the `card_collection` table.
4. Provide a way to revert these changes if needed.

This system allows for efficient tracking of how many collections each user has without the need for manual updates or complex queries every time this information is needed. It's particularly useful for applications that need to display or use this information frequently, as it provides a pre-calculated count that's always up-to-date.

## Key Files

### up.sql
This file contains the SQL commands to set up the new table and trigger system. It performs the following actions:

1. Creates the `user_collection_counts` table with columns:
   - `id` (UUID): A unique identifier for each row
   - `user_id` (UUID): A foreign key referencing the `users` table
   - `collection_count` (INTEGER): The number of collections a user has

2. Defines a function `update_collection_counts()` that updates the `collection_count` in the `user_collection_counts` table whenever a change occurs in the `card_collection` table.

3. Creates a trigger `update_collection_counts_trigger` on the `card_collection` table that calls the `update_collection_counts()` function after INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE operations.

4. Initializes the `user_collection_counts` table with existing data from the `card_collection` table.

Here's a snippet of the table creation:

```sql
CREATE TABLE user_collection_counts (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    user_id UUID UNIQUE REFERENCES users(id),
    collection_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0
);
```

### down.sql
This file contains the SQL commands to revert the changes made by `up.sql`. It performs the following actions:

1. Drops the `update_collection_counts_trigger` trigger from the `card_collection` table.
2. Drops the `update_collection_counts()` function.
3. Drops the `user_collection_counts` table.

Here's the complete content of `down.sql`:

```sql
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS update_collection_counts_trigger ON card_collection;
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS update_collection_counts();
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS user_collection_counts;
```

## Dependencies
This migration relies on the existence of two tables in the database:

1. `users` table: Referenced in the `user_collection_counts` table definition.
2. `card_collection` table: Used in the trigger definition and for initializing the `user_collection_counts` table.

The migration also uses PostgreSQL-specific features such as:

- `gen_random_uuid()` function for generating UUIDs
- `AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE OR DELETE` trigger syntax
- `FOR EACH ROW` trigger execution

## Configuration
This migration doesn't require any specific configuration. However, it's important to note that the migration assumes the existence of certain tables and follows a specific naming convention:

- The `users` table is expected to have an `id` column of type UUID.
- The `card_collection` table is expected to have an `author_id` column referencing the `users` table.

When applying this migration, ensure that these assumptions hold true in your database schema. If your schema differs, you may need to modify the migration scripts accordingly.

In conclusion, this migration sets up an efficient system for tracking user collection counts, which can be particularly useful for applications that frequently need to display or use this information. The trigger-based approach ensures that the counts are always up-to-date without requiring manual intervention or complex queries.
