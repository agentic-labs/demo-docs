title: "down.sql"

## High-level description
This SQL script is a database migration file that reverts a change made to the `users` table. Specifically, it drops the `api_key_hash` column. This suggests that a previous migration added this column, and this "down" migration undoes that change.

## Symbols

### `ALTER TABLE users DROP COLUMN api_key_hash;`
#### Description
This SQL statement removes the `api_key_hash` column from the `users` table.

#### Internal Logic
1. **`ALTER TABLE users`**: This part specifies that the `users` table is being modified.
2. **`DROP COLUMN api_key_hash`**: This instructs the database to remove the column named `api_key_hash`.

#### Side Effects
- The `api_key_hash` column will be permanently removed from the `users` table.
- Any data previously stored in this column will be lost.
