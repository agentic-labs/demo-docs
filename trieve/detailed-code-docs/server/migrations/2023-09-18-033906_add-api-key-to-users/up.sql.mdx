## High-level description
This SQL migration file adds a new column called `api_key_hash` to the `users` table. The purpose of this migration is to extend the user data structure to include a hashed API key, which can be used for authentication or API access control.

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE users
#### Description
This SQL command modifies the existing `users` table structure by adding a new column.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `ALTER TABLE` statement is used to modify the `users` table.
2. The `ADD COLUMN` clause specifies that a new column is being added to the table.
3. The new column is named `api_key_hash` and has a data type of `TEXT`.

## Side Effects
- This migration will modify the structure of the `users` table in the database.
- Existing rows in the `users` table will have a `NULL` value for the new `api_key_hash` column unless a default value is specified (which is not the case in this migration).
- Any applications or queries that rely on the structure of the `users` table may need to be updated to account for the new column.

## Performance Considerations
- Adding a new column to an existing table is generally a fast operation, especially when no default value is specified.
- However, for very large tables, this operation might take some time and could potentially lock the table during the migration.

## Error Handling
This migration does not include any explicit error handling. If the migration fails (e.g., if the column already exists or if there are permission issues), the database system will typically roll back the changes and report an error.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in this migration file. However, after applying this migration, the application code will need to be updated to handle the new `api_key_hash` column, including:
1. Generating and hashing API keys for users
2. Storing the hashed API keys in the new column
3. Implementing authentication logic using the stored API key hashes
