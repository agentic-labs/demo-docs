## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration files for adding an `api_key_hash` column to the `users` table in the database. The migration is dated September 18, 2023, at 03:39:06, as indicated by the directory name. The purpose of this migration is to extend the user data structure to include a hashed API key, which can be used for authentication or API access control.

## What does it do?
This migration performs the following actions:

1. In the "up" migration:
   - It adds a new column called `api_key_hash` to the `users` table.
   - The new column is of type `TEXT`, allowing for the storage of hashed API keys.

2. In the "down" migration:
   - It removes the `api_key_hash` column from the `users` table.
   - This action reverses the changes made by the "up" migration.

These changes allow the application to associate API keys with user accounts, enabling API-based authentication or access control mechanisms. The use of a hashed API key enhances security by ensuring that the actual API keys are not stored in plain text in the database.

## Key Files
The directory contains two important SQL files:

1. `up.sql`: This file contains the SQL commands to add the `api_key_hash` column to the `users` table. It's responsible for implementing the new feature.

2. `down.sql`: This file contains the SQL commands to remove the `api_key_hash` column from the `users` table. It's used to revert the changes made by the `up.sql` file if needed.

Both files are crucial for managing the database schema changes related to the API key feature.

## Configuration
This migration does not use any external configuration files or environment variables. The SQL commands are hardcoded in the migration files.

## Side Effects and Considerations

1. Data Structure Changes:
   - The `users` table structure will be modified to include the new `api_key_hash` column.
   - Existing rows in the `users` table will have a `NULL` value for the new `api_key_hash` column after the "up" migration.

2. Data Loss Risk:
   - Running the "down" migration will result in the permanent loss of any data stored in the `api_key_hash` column.

3. Application Updates:
   - After applying the "up" migration, the application code will need to be updated to handle the new `api_key_hash` column, including:
     a. Generating and hashing API keys for users
     b. Storing the hashed API keys in the new column
     c. Implementing authentication logic using the stored API key hashes

4. Performance:
   - Adding a new column to an existing table is generally a fast operation, especially when no default value is specified.
   - However, for very large `users` tables, this operation might take some time and could potentially lock the table during the migration.

5. Error Handling:
   - The migration files do not include explicit error handling.
   - If a migration fails (e.g., if the column already exists or if there are permission issues), the database system will typically roll back the changes and report an error.

6. Dependencies:
   - The migrations rely on the existence of the `users` table in the database.
   - The "down" migration specifically depends on the existence of the `api_key_hash` column in the `users` table.

In conclusion, this migration set provides a straightforward way to add API key functionality to the user system. It's important to coordinate these database changes with corresponding updates to the application code to fully implement and utilize the new API key feature.
