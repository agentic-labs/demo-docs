## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for adding an `api_key_hash` column to the `users` table in a database. The migration is dated 2023-09-18, and it includes both "up" and "down" scripts to apply and revert the changes respectively.

## What does it do?
These migration scripts modify the structure of the `users` table in a database. The "up" migration adds a new column called `api_key_hash` to store hashed API keys for user authentication. This allows the system to associate API keys with user accounts, enabling API-based authentication. The "down" migration provides a way to undo this change by removing the `api_key_hash` column if needed.

## Key Files

1. `up.sql`:
   This file contains the SQL command to add the `api_key_hash` column to the `users` table. The command is:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN api_key_hash TEXT;
   ```
   This adds a new TEXT column named `api_key_hash` to the `users` table, which will be used to store hashed API keys.

2. `down.sql`:
   This file contains the SQL command to remove the `api_key_hash` column from the `users` table. The command is:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE users DROP COLUMN api_key_hash;
   ```
   This removes the `api_key_hash` column from the `users` table, effectively undoing the change made by the "up" migration.

## Configuration
The migration is identified by its timestamp: `2023-09-18-033906`. This timestamp is likely used by a migration management system to track which migrations have been applied and in what order.

These migration scripts are designed to be run by a database migration tool, which would typically be configured to look for migration files in this directory and apply them in the correct order based on their timestamps.

It's important to note that running the "down" migration will permanently remove the `api_key_hash` column and any data it contains. This should be done with caution and only when necessary, such as when rolling back changes during development or troubleshooting.

The choice to use a TEXT data type for the `api_key_hash` column suggests that the hashed API keys may be of variable length. This is appropriate for storing cryptographic hashes, which are typically represented as fixed-length strings but may vary in length depending on the hashing algorithm used.

When implementing the API key functionality in the application code, developers should ensure that API keys are properly hashed before being stored in this column, and that appropriate measures are taken to secure the API keys in transit and in use.
