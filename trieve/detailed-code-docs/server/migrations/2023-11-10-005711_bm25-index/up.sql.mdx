## High-level description
This SQL migration file is intended to create a BM25 index for full-text search on the `card_metadata` table. However, the actual index creation is commented out, and a placeholder SELECT statement is used instead. This suggests that the migration is currently a no-op (no operation) placeholder.

### Commented-out BM25 Index Creation
#### Description
The commented-out code attempts to create a BM25 index on the `card_metadata` table for improved full-text search capabilities. BM25 is a ranking function used in information retrieval systems, particularly for full-text search.

#### Internal Logic
1. It would create a PostgreSQL extension `pg_bm25` if it doesn't already exist.
2. It would then create an index named `idx_content_search` on the `card_metadata` table.
3. The index would use the BM25 algorithm and include all columns of the `card_metadata` table.
4. It specifies that the `card_html` field should be treated as a text field for the BM25 index.

### SELECT 1 Statement
#### Description
This is a simple SQL statement that selects the constant value 1. It serves as a placeholder to ensure the migration file runs without errors, even though it doesn't make any actual changes to the database schema.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| 1 | integer | The constant value 1 |

## TODOs
The commented-out code suggests that there's an intention to implement a BM25 index in the future. The developers should consider:
1. Implementing the BM25 index when ready.
2. Ensuring the `pg_bm25` extension is available in the PostgreSQL environment.
3. Verifying that the `card_metadata` table and its `card_html` column exist and are suitable for indexing.
4. Testing the performance impact of the BM25 index once implemented.
