## High-level description
This SQL migration script is designed to revert the changes made in the corresponding `up.sql` file. It removes the `tracking_id` column from the `chunk_group` table and drops a unique constraint associated with it.

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE chunk_group DROP COLUMN tracking_id;
#### Description
This SQL statement removes the `tracking_id` column from the `chunk_group` table.

#### Internal Logic
The statement uses the `ALTER TABLE` command to modify the structure of the `chunk_group` table. The `DROP COLUMN` clause is used to remove the `tracking_id` column entirely from the table.

### ALTER TABLE chunk_group DROP CONSTRAINT chunk_group_tracking_id_dataset_id_key;
#### Description
This SQL statement removes a unique constraint that was previously added to the `chunk_group` table.

#### Internal Logic
The statement uses the `ALTER TABLE` command to modify the `chunk_group` table. The `DROP CONSTRAINT` clause is used to remove the constraint named `chunk_group_tracking_id_dataset_id_key`. This constraint likely ensured uniqueness across the combination of `tracking_id` and `dataset_id` columns.

## Side Effects
- The `tracking_id` column will be permanently removed from the `chunk_group` table, along with all data stored in that column.
- The unique constraint `chunk_group_tracking_id_dataset_id_key` will be removed, potentially allowing duplicate combinations of `tracking_id` and `dataset_id` if these columns still exist in the table.

## Dependencies
This script is dependent on the database management system supporting standard SQL ALTER TABLE statements for dropping columns and constraints.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this script. If the column or constraint doesn't exist, the database will likely raise an error, which should be handled by the migration system running this script.
