title: "down.sql"

## High-level description
This SQL script defines the down migration for a database change related to the `chunk_group` table. It reverts the changes introduced by the corresponding `up.sql` migration, specifically by removing the `tracking_id` column and its associated constraint.

### `down.sql`
#### Description
This SQL script removes the `tracking_id` column and its associated constraint from the `chunk_group` table. This effectively undoes the changes introduced by the corresponding `up.sql` migration.

#### Internal Logic
1. **`ALTER TABLE chunk_group DROP COLUMN tracking_id;`**: This statement removes the `tracking_id` column from the `chunk_group` table.
2. **`ALTER TABLE chunk_group DROP CONSTRAINT chunk_group_tracking_id_dataset_id_key;`**: This statement removes the constraint named `chunk_group_tracking_id_dataset_id_key` from the `chunk_group` table. This constraint was likely associated with the `tracking_id` column and needs to be removed when the column is dropped.
