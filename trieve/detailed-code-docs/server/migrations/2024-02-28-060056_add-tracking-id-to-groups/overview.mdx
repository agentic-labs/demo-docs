## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for adding a `tracking_id` column to the `chunk_group` table in a database. The migration is designed to be reversible, with separate scripts for applying (up) and reverting (down) the changes.

## What does it do?
The migration accomplishes the following:

1. Adds a new column called `tracking_id` to the `chunk_group` table.
2. Ensures that the `tracking_id` values are unique across all rows in the table.
3. Creates a unique constraint that combines `tracking_id` and `dataset_id`, ensuring that no two rows have the same combination of these values.
4. Provides a way to undo these changes if needed.

This migration enhances the `chunk_group` table by introducing a tracking mechanism, likely used for identifying and managing groups of chunks within datasets more effectively.

## Key Files

### up.sql
This file contains the SQL commands to apply the migration:

```sql
ALTER TABLE chunk_group ADD COLUMN tracking_id TEXT UNIQUE;
ALTER TABLE chunk_group ADD CONSTRAINT chunk_group_tracking_id_dataset_id_key UNIQUE (tracking_id, dataset_id);
```

The first command adds the `tracking_id` column with a `UNIQUE` constraint, while the second command creates a composite unique constraint on `tracking_id` and `dataset_id`.

### down.sql
This file contains the SQL commands to revert the migration:

```sql
ALTER TABLE chunk_group DROP CONSTRAINT chunk_group_tracking_id_dataset_id_key;
ALTER TABLE chunk_group DROP COLUMN tracking_id;
```

These commands remove the unique constraint and the `tracking_id` column, effectively undoing the changes made by the up migration.

## Configuration
The migration is identified by its timestamp: `2024-02-28-060056`. This timestamp is likely used by a migration management system to track which migrations have been applied and in what order.

No additional configuration files or environment variables are required for this migration.
