## High-level description
This SQL script defines the "down" migration for reverting changes related to tag sets in the database. It drops two tables: `chunk_metadata_tags` and `dataset_tags`.

## Symbols

### `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS chunk_metadata_tags`
#### Description
This statement attempts to drop the table named `chunk_metadata_tags` only if it exists. This ensures that the script does not fail if the table is already absent.

#### Internal Logic
- It uses the `DROP TABLE` statement to remove the table.
- The `IF EXISTS` clause makes the operation conditional, preventing errors if the table doesn't exist.

### `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS dataset_tags`
#### Description
Similar to the previous statement, this one attempts to drop the table named `dataset_tags` if it exists.

#### Internal Logic
- It uses the `DROP TABLE` statement to remove the table.
- The `IF EXISTS` clause makes the operation conditional, preventing errors if the table doesn't exist.
