## High-level description
This SQL script handles the database migration to drop the `stripe_customers` table. This is typically done when the table is no longer needed or is being replaced with a different structure.

## Symbols

### `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS stripe_customers;`
#### Description
This SQL statement attempts to drop the table named `stripe_customers`. The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the statement executes without error even if the table does not exist.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Check for Existence:** The database checks if a table named `stripe_customers` exists.
2. **Drop Table (If Exists):** If the table exists, it is permanently deleted along with all its data. If the table does not exist, no action is taken.
