## High-level description
This SQL script defines a database migration that drops the `stripe_customers` table if it exists. 

## Symbols

### `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS stripe_customers;`
#### Description
This SQL statement attempts to drop the table named `stripe_customers`. The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the statement executes successfully even if the table does not exist. If the table exists, it will be permanently deleted along with all its data.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Check for Existence:** The database checks if a table named `stripe_customers` exists.
2. **Conditional Drop:**
   - If the table exists, the `DROP TABLE` command is executed, permanently deleting the table and its data.
   - If the table does not exist, no action is taken.

#### Side Effects
- **Data Loss:** If the `stripe_customers` table exists, this statement will permanently delete it and all associated data.
