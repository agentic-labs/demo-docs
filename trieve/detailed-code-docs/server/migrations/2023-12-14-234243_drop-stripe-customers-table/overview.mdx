## High-level description
This directory contains migration files for a database schema change related to dropping the `stripe_customers` table. It includes two SQL scripts: `up.sql` for applying the change and `down.sql` for reverting it. These migrations are part of a larger application that integrates with Stripe for customer management.

## What does it do?
The migration in this directory removes a table from the database that was previously used to store information about Stripe customers. This change suggests that the application is either discontinuing the use of Stripe for customer management or changing how it handles Stripe customer data.

When the migration is applied:
1. The `stripe_customers` table is removed from the database, along with all its data.

If the migration needs to be reverted:
1. The `stripe_customers` table is recreated with its original structure.
2. The table includes columns for a unique identifier, Stripe customer ID, email address, and timestamps for creation and updates.
3. A relationship is established between this table and a `users` table through the email address.

## Key Files

### up.sql
This file contains the SQL command to drop the `stripe_customers` table:

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS stripe_customers;
```

The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the operation doesn't fail if the table has already been removed.

### down.sql
This file contains the SQL commands to recreate the `stripe_customers` table if the migration needs to be reversed:

```sql
CREATE TABLE stripe_customers (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    stripe_id TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    email TEXT UNIQUE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (email) REFERENCES users(email)
);
```

This recreates the table with the following structure:
- `id`: A UUID serving as the primary key
- `stripe_id`: A unique text field for storing the Stripe customer ID
- `email`: A unique, nullable text field for the customer's email address
- `created_at` and `updated_at`: Timestamp fields for tracking record creation and updates
- A foreign key constraint linking the `email` field to the `users` table

## Configuration
The migration is identified by its timestamp: `2023-12-14-234243`. This timestamp is likely used by the migration system to determine the order in which migrations should be applied or rolled back.

## Dependencies
While not explicitly stated, this migration implies the existence of:
1. A database system that supports SQL (likely PostgreSQL, given the use of UUID as a data type).
2. A migration system that can execute these SQL scripts (such as Diesel for Rust or similar ORM tools).
3. An existing `users` table in the database, which is referenced by the foreign key constraint in the `down.sql` script.

This migration is part of a larger application that integrates with Stripe for payment processing or customer management. The removal of this table suggests a significant change in how the application handles Stripe customer data, possibly moving towards a different storage strategy or removing Stripe integration altogether.
