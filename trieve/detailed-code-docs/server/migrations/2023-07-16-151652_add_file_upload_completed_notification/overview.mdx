## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for adding a new feature to the database schema: file upload completed notifications. The migration introduces a new table to store information about notifications sent to users when file uploads are completed successfully.

## What does it do?
The migration scripts in this directory add functionality to track and manage notifications for completed file uploads. Here's a breakdown of what it accomplishes:

1. Creates a new table called `file_upload_completed_notifications` to store information about these notifications.
2. Each notification entry includes:
   - A unique identifier
   - The user who should receive the notification
   - The collection the uploaded file belongs to
   - A flag indicating whether the user has read the notification
   - Timestamps for creation and last update
3. Provides a way to revert these changes if needed

This allows the application to keep track of which users should be notified about completed file uploads, whether they've seen these notifications, and when the notifications were created or updated. This can be used to improve user experience by informing users when their file uploads are complete and allowing them to manage these notifications.

## Key Files

### up.sql
This file contains the SQL commands to create the new `file_upload_completed_notifications` table. It defines the structure of the table with the following columns:

- `id`: A UUID serving as the primary key for each notification
- `user_uuid`: The UUID of the user who should receive the notification
- `collection_uuid`: The UUID of the collection the uploaded file belongs to
- `user_read`: A boolean flag indicating whether the user has read the notification (defaults to false)
- `created_at`: A timestamp for when the notification was created (defaults to the current time)
- `updated_at`: A timestamp for when the notification was last updated (defaults to the current time)

### down.sql
This file contains the SQL command to revert the changes made by the up.sql script. It simply drops the `file_upload_completed_notifications` table if it exists. This allows for easy rollback of the migration if needed.

## Configuration
The migration is identified by its timestamp: 2023-07-16-151652. This timestamp is part of the directory name and helps maintain the order of migrations in the database schema evolution.

Here's an example of how the `file_upload_completed_notifications` table is created in `up.sql`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE file_upload_completed_notifications (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    user_uuid UUID NOT NULL,
    collection_uuid UUID NOT NULL,
    user_read BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

And here's how it's dropped in `down.sql`:

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS file_upload_completed_notifications;
```

These scripts are typically executed by a migration tool or framework that manages database schema changes. The tool would run `up.sql` when applying the migration and `down.sql` when rolling it back.
