## High-level description
This SQL migration file is designed to undo the changes made by the corresponding `up.sql` file. It removes the `file_upload_completed_notifications` table from the database if it exists.

## Symbols

### `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS file_upload_completed_notifications;`
#### Description
This SQL command is used to remove the `file_upload_completed_notifications` table from the database schema.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `DROP TABLE` command is used to delete a table and all its data from the database.
2. The `IF EXISTS` clause is added as a safety measure. It prevents the command from throwing an error if the table doesn't exist.
3. `file_upload_completed_notifications` is the name of the table being dropped.

## Side Effects
- If the `file_upload_completed_notifications` table exists, it will be permanently removed from the database, along with all its data.
- If the table doesn't exist, the command will have no effect, and no error will be raised.

## Performance Considerations
This operation is typically fast, especially if the table is small. However, for very large tables, dropping can take some time and may temporarily lock the database, potentially affecting other operations.

## Error Handling
The `IF EXISTS` clause provides basic error handling by preventing the command from failing if the table doesn't exist. This makes the migration more robust and allows it to be run multiple times without causing errors.
