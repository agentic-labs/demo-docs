## High-level description
This SQL script defines the "down" migration for reverting changes introduced by the "add_file_upload_completed_notification" migration. It specifically handles the removal of the `file_upload_completed_notifications` table.

## Symbols

### `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS file_upload_completed_notifications;`
#### Description
This SQL statement handles the removal of the `file_upload_completed_notifications` table if it exists. The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the statement executes successfully even if the table doesn't exist, preventing potential errors during migration rollback.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Check for Table Existence:** The database checks if a table named `file_upload_completed_notifications` exists.
2. **Conditional Drop:**
   - If the table exists, the `DROP TABLE` command removes the table and all its data.
   - If the table doesn't exist, the statement completes without taking any action.
