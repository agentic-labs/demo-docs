## High-level description
This code is a build script for a Rust project, responsible for setting environment variables during the build process. It reads environment variables from a `.env` file (if the `runtime-env` feature is not enabled) and makes them available to the Rust compiler.

## Code Structure
The code uses a conditional compilation attribute `#[cfg(not(feature = "runtime-env"))]` to determine which part of the code to compile based on the presence of the `runtime-env` feature flag. 

- If the `runtime-env` feature is **not** enabled, the code reads environment variables from a `.env` file and sets them as `cargo:rustc-env` variables.
- If the `runtime-env` feature **is** enabled, the code does nothing.

## Symbols

### `main`
#### Description
This function is the entry point of the build script. It reads environment variables from a `.env` file (if the `runtime-env` feature is not enabled) and sets them as environment variables for the Rust compiler.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
- `Result&lt;(), Box&lt;dyn Error&gt;&gt;`: Returns `Ok(())` on success, or an error if the `.env` file cannot be read.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Check for `runtime-env` feature:**
   - If the `runtime-env` feature is enabled, the function returns `Ok(())` without performing any actions.
2. **Read environment variables from `.env` file (if `runtime-env` is not enabled):**
   - Uses the `dotenvy` crate to load environment variables from a `.env` file located in the project root.
   - Expects the `.env` file to exist and throws an error if it's not found, suggesting to copy the `.env.dist` file to `.env`.
3. **Set environment variables for Rust compiler:**
   - Iterates through the loaded environment variables.
   - For each key-value pair, prints a string in the format `cargo:rustc-env={key}={value}`, which instructs Cargo to set the corresponding environment variable during compilation.
4. **Trigger rebuild on `.env` file change:**
   - Prints `cargo:rerun-if-changed=.env`, instructing Cargo to re-run the build script if the `.env` file is modified.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `dotenv` | Used to read environment variables from a `.env` file. |

## Configuration
This code uses the `runtime-env` feature flag to control its behavior. 

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| `runtime-env` | Feature flag | Not set | If enabled, the build script does not read environment variables from the `.env` file. This suggests an alternative mechanism for managing environment variables at runtime is in place. |
