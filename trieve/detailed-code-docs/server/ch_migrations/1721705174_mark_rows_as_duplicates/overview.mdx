## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for altering the `search_queries` table in a database. The migration is specifically designed to add and remove a column named `is_duplicate` to flag duplicate entries in the table.

## What does it do?
The migration scripts in this directory perform the following actions:

1. Add a new column: The "up" migration adds a column called `is_duplicate` to the `search_queries` table. This column is designed to flag whether a row is a duplicate or not. By default, all rows are marked as non-duplicates (with a value of 0).

2. Remove the column: The "down" migration removes the `is_duplicate` column from the `search_queries` table, effectively undoing the changes made by the "up" migration.

These scripts allow database administrators or developers to easily add functionality for marking duplicate entries in the `search_queries` table, and to revert this change if needed.

## Key Files

1. `up.sql`: This file contains the SQL script to add the `is_duplicate` column to the `search_queries` table.

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE search_queries
   ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS is_duplicate UInt8 DEFAULT 0
   ```

   This script adds an 8-bit unsigned integer column named `is_duplicate` with a default value of 0, indicating that rows are not duplicates by default.

2. `down.sql`: This file contains the SQL script to remove the `is_duplicate` column from the `search_queries` table.

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE search_queries
   DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS is_duplicate
   ```

   This script removes the `is_duplicate` column if it exists, reverting the changes made by the "up" migration.

## Configuration
These migration scripts do not require any specific configuration. They are designed to be run as part of a database migration system, likely using a tool that can execute "up" and "down" migrations based on version numbers or timestamps.

The migration is identified by the timestamp `1721705174` in the directory name, which suggests that this migration system uses Unix timestamps to order migrations.

## Side Effects
Running these migrations will have the following effects:

1. `up.sql`:
   - Modifies the structure of the `search_queries` table by adding the `is_duplicate` column.
   - All existing rows in the table will have the `is_duplicate` column added with a default value of 0.
   - Future insertions into this table will include this new column, defaulting to 0 unless specified otherwise.

2. `down.sql`:
   - Removes the `is_duplicate` column from the `search_queries` table.
   - Any data stored in the `is_duplicate` column will be permanently lost.

## Performance Considerations
1. Adding a new column (`up.sql`):
   - This operation can be potentially expensive, especially if the `search_queries` table is large.
   - The `IF NOT EXISTS` clause helps prevent accidental re-runs of this migration, which could lead to errors or unnecessary operations.

2. Removing a column (`down.sql`):
   - Dropping a column is generally a quick operation but may briefly lock the table.
   - The impact on performance should be minimal, especially if the table is not actively being used during the migration.

## Error Handling
Both scripts use `IF EXISTS` or `IF NOT EXISTS` clauses to prevent errors if the column already exists (when adding) or doesn't exist (when removing). This makes the scripts idempotent, meaning they can be run multiple times without causing errors or unintended side effects.

In conclusion, these migration scripts provide a straightforward way to add and remove a column for flagging duplicate entries in the `search_queries` table. They are designed to be reversible and include basic error prevention measures.
