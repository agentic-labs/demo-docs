title: "down.sql"

## High-level description
This SQL script is designed to revert changes made to the `search_queries` table by removing the `is_duplicate` column. It's part of a database migration system, specifically a "down" migration, which is used to undo changes made by an "up" migration.

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE search_queries
#### Description
This SQL command modifies the structure of the `search_queries` table by removing a column.

#### Internal Logic
The script uses the `DROP COLUMN` clause to remove the `is_duplicate` column from the `search_queries` table. The `IF EXISTS` condition is used to prevent errors if the column doesn't exist, making the script idempotent.

## Side Effects
Executing this script will modify the structure of the `search_queries` table by removing the `is_duplicate` column if it exists. This action is irreversible and will result in the loss of any data stored in that column.

## Performance Considerations
Dropping a column is generally a quick operation, but it may lock the table briefly. The impact on performance should be minimal, especially if the table is not actively being used during the migration.

## Error Handling
The `IF EXISTS` clause provides a basic form of error handling. If the `is_duplicate` column doesn't exist, the script will not throw an error and will continue execution.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in this script.
