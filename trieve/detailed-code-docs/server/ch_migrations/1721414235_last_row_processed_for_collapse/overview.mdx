## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for a ClickHouse database, specifically focusing on the creation and removal of a `last_collapsed_dataset` table. The migration is identified by the timestamp 1721414235 and is related to tracking the last row processed for a collapse operation.

## What does it do?
These scripts manage the lifecycle of a database table that keeps track of when datasets were last collapsed. The "up" migration creates a new table called `last_collapsed_dataset` with specific columns to store information about dataset collapses. The "down" migration removes this table if it exists. This allows for easy tracking of collapse operations on datasets and provides a way to revert the changes if needed.

## Key Files

1. `up.sql`:
   - Creates the `last_collapsed_dataset` table in the ClickHouse database.
   - The table uses a ReplacingMergeTree engine for efficient updates.
   - Columns include `id`, `last_collapsed`, `dataset_id`, and `created_at`.
   - The table is partitioned by month and `dataset_id`, and ordered by `dataset_id`.

2. `down.sql`:
   - Removes the `last_collapsed_dataset` table if it exists.
   - Uses the `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS` command for idempotent execution.

## Dependencies
The scripts are specifically designed for ClickHouse, a column-oriented database management system. They use ClickHouse-specific SQL syntax and features, which may not be compatible with other database systems.

## Configuration
No explicit configuration files are present in this directory. However, the table structure in `up.sql` implies some design decisions:

1. Use of UUID for `id` and `dataset_id` columns, suggesting a distributed system architecture.
2. Partitioning by month and `dataset_id`, indicating an expectation of large datasets and a need for efficient querying based on time and dataset.
3. Use of ReplacingMergeTree engine, showing a requirement for efficient updates of existing records.

These design choices should be considered when working with or modifying the `last_collapsed_dataset` table.

Code snippet from `up.sql`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS last_collapsed_dataset
(
    id UUID,
    last_collapsed DateTime,
    dataset_id UUID,
    created_at DateTime
)
ENGINE = ReplacingMergeTree(created_at)
PARTITION BY (toYYYYMM(created_at), dataset_id)
ORDER BY dataset_id
```

This structure allows for efficient querying of the last collapse operation for each dataset, while also enabling easy updates and maintenance of the data over time.
