## High-level description
This SQL script is designed to remove the `last_collapsed_dataset` table from the database if it exists. It's a database migration script, specifically a "down" migration, which is used to revert changes made by a corresponding "up" migration.

## Symbols

### DROP TABLE IF EXISTS last_collapsed_dataset
#### Description
This SQL command is used to delete the `last_collapsed_dataset` table from the database schema if it exists.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `IF EXISTS` clause is used to prevent errors if the table doesn't exist.
2. If the table exists, it will be completely removed from the database, including all its data and structure.

## Side Effects
- If the `last_collapsed_dataset` table exists, it will be permanently deleted from the database, along with all its contents.
- If the table doesn't exist, this command will have no effect on the database.

## Performance Considerations
This operation is typically fast, but the exact performance impact depends on the size of the table and the database system's implementation. For very large tables, dropping might take some time and could momentarily impact database performance.

## Error Handling
The `IF EXISTS` clause prevents the script from throwing an error if the table doesn't exist, making this script more robust and idempotent (can be run multiple times without causing errors).
