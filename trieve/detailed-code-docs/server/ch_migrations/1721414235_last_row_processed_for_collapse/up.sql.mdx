## High-level description
This SQL script creates a new table named `last_collapsed_dataset` in a ClickHouse database. The table is designed to store information about the last time a dataset was collapsed, using a ReplacingMergeTree engine for efficient updates and queries.

## Symbols

### `last_collapsed_dataset` Table
#### Description
This table is created to keep track of the last collapse operation performed on datasets. It uses ClickHouse-specific syntax and features to optimize storage and querying.

#### Columns
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | UUID | Unique identifier for each record |
| last_collapsed | DateTime | Timestamp of the last collapse operation |
| dataset_id | UUID | Identifier of the dataset |
| created_at | DateTime | Timestamp of when the record was created |

#### Internal Logic
1. The table uses the ReplacingMergeTree engine, which allows for efficient updates of records based on the `created_at` field.
2. The table is ordered by `dataset_id`, which optimizes queries filtering or joining on this column.
3. The table is partitioned by month (derived from `created_at`) and `dataset_id`, which can improve query performance and data management for large datasets.

## Performance Considerations
1. The ReplacingMergeTree engine is used to efficiently handle updates to existing records, keeping only the latest version based on the `created_at` field.
2. Partitioning by month and dataset_id allows for efficient data pruning and faster queries when filtering by date ranges or specific datasets.
3. Ordering by `dataset_id` optimizes queries that filter or join on this column.
