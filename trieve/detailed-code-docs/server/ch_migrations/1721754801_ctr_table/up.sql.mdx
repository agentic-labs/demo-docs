## High-level description
This SQL script creates a table named `ctr_data` in a ClickHouse database. The table is designed to store data related to CTR (Click-Through Rate) or similar metrics, with a specific structure and optimization settings for efficient querying and data management.

## Symbols

### `ctr_data` Table
#### Description
The `ctr_data` table is created to store various identifiers, metadata, and timestamps related to CTR data. It uses the MergeTree engine, which is optimized for insert and select queries on large datasets.

#### Columns
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | UUID | Unique identifier for each record |
| request_id | UUID | Identifier for the associated request |
| chunk_id | UUID | Identifier for the associated chunk |
| dataset_id | UUID | Identifier for the associated dataset |
| position | Int32 | Integer representing the position (possibly in a list or sequence) |
| metadata | String | String containing additional metadata |
| created_at | DateTime | Timestamp of when the record was created |

#### Internal Logic
1. The table uses the MergeTree engine, which is efficient for read and write operations on large datasets.
2. The ORDER BY clause specifies the primary key and sorting order: (dataset_id, created_at, request_id, id). This order is optimized for queries that filter or sort by these columns.
3. The PARTITION BY clause defines how data is partitioned:
   - By year and month of the created_at timestamp
   - By dataset_id
   This partitioning strategy can improve query performance and data management.
4. A TTL (Time-To-Live) clause is set to automatically delete data after 30 days from the created_at timestamp.

## Performance Considerations
1. The MergeTree engine is chosen for its high performance on large datasets.
2. The ORDER BY clause is optimized for queries that filter or sort by dataset_id, created_at, request_id, and id.
3. Partitioning by month and dataset_id can significantly improve query performance for time-based and dataset-specific queries.
4. The TTL clause helps manage data retention automatically, potentially improving overall system performance by keeping the dataset size under control.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ClickHouse | The database system for which this SQL script is written |

Note: This script assumes the use of ClickHouse, as evidenced by ClickHouse-specific syntax such as the MergeTree engine and the PARTITION BY clause.
