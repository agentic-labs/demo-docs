## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for a ClickHouse database, focusing on creating, modifying, and managing tables related to dataset events, search queries, recommendations, and other analytics-related data. The migrations are part of a versioned database schema management system, allowing for controlled evolution of the database structure over time.

## What does it do?
The migrations in this directory perform several key functions:

1. Create initial tables for storing dataset events, search queries, cluster topics, search cluster memberships, RAG queries, and recommendations.
2. Add and remove columns to existing tables, such as adding a 'type' column to the ctr_data table and a 'user_id' column to several tables.
3. Modify table properties, such as removing Time-To-Live (TTL) settings from multiple tables.
4. Create new tables for specific purposes, like tracking the last collapsed dataset or storing CTR (Click-Through Rate) data.

These migrations allow the database schema to evolve to support new features, improve performance, or adjust data retention policies. They provide a structured way to apply changes to the database and roll them back if necessary.

## Entry points
The main entry points for these migrations are the individual SQL files within each numbered directory. Each migration typically consists of two files:

1. `up.sql`: Contains SQL commands to apply the migration, such as creating tables or adding columns.
2. `down.sql`: Contains SQL commands to revert the migration, such as dropping tables or removing columns.

The migrations are likely executed in order based on their timestamp or numerical prefix. The `chm.toml` file in the root of the directory provides configuration for connecting to the ClickHouse database.

## Key Files
1. `1720668303_create_inital_tables/up.sql`: Creates the initial set of tables for the application.
2. `1721414235_last_row_processed_for_collapse/up.sql`: Creates a table to track the last collapsed dataset.
3. `1721705174_mark_rows_as_duplicates/up.sql`: Adds an `is_duplicate` column to the `search_queries` table.
4. `1721754801_ctr_table/up.sql`: Creates a table for storing CTR data.
5. `1721845099_add_ctr_type/up.sql`: Adds a 'type' column to the ctr_data table.
6. `1722546114_add-bad-query-flag/up.sql`: Adds a `query_rating` column to the `search_queries` table.
7. `1722913965_recreate_recommendations_table/up.sql`: Recreates the `recommendations` table with a new structure.
8. `1722983788_remove_table_ttl/up.sql`: Removes TTL settings from multiple tables.
9. `1723680843_add_user_ids/up.sql`: Adds a `user_id` column to several tables.

## Dependencies
The migrations are designed for ClickHouse, a column-oriented database management system. They rely on ClickHouse-specific features such as:

- MergeTree and ReplacingMergeTree storage engines
- Array data types
- TTL (Time-To-Live) functionality
- Partitioning and ordering capabilities

## Configuration
The `chm.toml` file in the root of the directory provides configuration for connecting to the ClickHouse database:

```toml
url = "http://localhost:8123"
user = "clickhouse"
password = "password"
database = "default"
```

This configuration specifies the URL, user credentials, and the default database to be used for ClickHouse migrations. In a production environment, it would be advisable to use environment variables or a secure secrets management system rather than hardcoding credentials in a configuration file.

The migrations themselves often include configurable aspects within the SQL scripts, such as:

- TTL settings (e.g., 30-day retention period)
- Partitioning schemes (e.g., by month and dataset_id)
- Column data types and default values

These can be adjusted in the SQL scripts to fine-tune the database behavior for specific requirements.
