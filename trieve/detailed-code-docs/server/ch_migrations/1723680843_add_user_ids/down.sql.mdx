title: "down.sql"

## High-level description
This SQL script is designed to revert changes made to three tables: `search_queries`, `recommendations`, and `rag_queries`. Specifically, it removes the `user_id` column from each of these tables. This is likely part of a database migration rollback process.

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE statements
#### Description
These SQL statements are used to modify the structure of existing tables in the database. In this case, they are removing a column named `user_id` from three different tables.

#### Internal Logic
1. The script targets three tables: `search_queries`, `recommendations`, and `rag_queries`.
2. For each table, it uses the `ALTER TABLE` command followed by `DROP COLUMN user_id`.
3. This operation removes the `user_id` column from each of the specified tables.

## Side Effects
- The `user_id` column will be permanently removed from the `search_queries`, `recommendations`, and `rag_queries` tables.
- Any data that was stored in these `user_id` columns will be lost.
- Queries or applications that relied on the `user_id` column in these tables will no longer function correctly after this script is executed.

## Performance Considerations
- Depending on the size of the tables and the database management system being used, dropping columns can be a relatively quick operation.
- However, if the tables are large or if there are indexes or constraints related to the `user_id` column, the operation might take longer to complete.
- It's advisable to run this script during a maintenance window or a period of low database activity to minimize potential disruptions.

## Dependencies
This script doesn't explicitly depend on any external libraries or modules. It uses standard SQL syntax that should be compatible with most relational database management systems.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this script. If an error occurs (e.g., if a table or column doesn't exist), the database system will likely raise an error and stop execution.

## Notes
1. This script is named "down.sql" and is located in a directory suggesting it's part of a migration with the ID 1723680843. This naming convention implies that this is a rollback script for a corresponding "up" migration that likely added these `user_id` columns.
2. Before running this script in a production environment, it's crucial to:
   - Backup the affected tables.
   - Ensure that removing these columns won't break any dependent applications or queries.
   - Test the script in a non-production environment first.
3. After running this script, any foreign key constraints or indexes that referenced these `user_id` columns will also need to be removed if they weren't automatically dropped by the database system.
