## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for adding a `user_id` column to three tables: `search_queries`, `recommendations`, and `rag_queries`. The migration is identified by the number 1723680843 and includes both "up" and "down" scripts for applying and reverting the changes, respectively.

## What does it do?
The migration scripts in this directory modify the database schema to include user-specific tracking capabilities for search queries, recommendations, and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) queries. Here's what happens:

1. The "up" script adds a new column called `user_id` of type String to each of the three tables mentioned above. This allows the system to associate these activities with specific users.

2. The "down" script removes the `user_id` column from the same three tables, effectively reverting the changes made by the "up" script.

These changes enable the application to track and analyze user-specific behavior related to searches, recommendations, and RAG queries, which can be useful for personalization, analytics, and user experience improvements.

## Key Files

1. `up.sql`: This file contains the SQL commands to add the `user_id` column to the `search_queries`, `recommendations`, and `rag_queries` tables. It's used when applying the migration.

2. `down.sql`: This file contains the SQL commands to remove the `user_id` column from the same three tables. It's used when rolling back the migration.

Both files use standard SQL `ALTER TABLE` statements to modify the table structures.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files in this directory, the migration scripts themselves serve as a form of configuration for the database schema. The key configurable aspects are:

1. Table names: `search_queries`, `recommendations`, and `rag_queries`
2. Column name: `user_id`
3. Data type: `String`

These values are hardcoded in the SQL scripts. If any changes to these configurations are needed, the SQL scripts would need to be modified directly.

## Performance Considerations
When applying or rolling back this migration, consider the following performance implications:

1. Table size: The time required to add or remove columns depends on the size of the tables. Large tables may take longer to modify.

2. Locking: Depending on the database system, these ALTER TABLE operations might lock the tables, potentially affecting application performance during the migration.

3. Indexing: The scripts don't create indexes on the new `user_id` column. Depending on how this column will be used, adding an index might be beneficial for query performance.

4. Data population: After adding the `user_id` column, existing rows will have NULL values. A separate data migration might be needed to populate these values for existing records.

5. Application impact: Queries or application code that relies on the structure of these tables may need to be updated to accommodate the new column.

It's recommended to run these migrations during a maintenance window or low-traffic period to minimize potential disruptions. Always backup the database before applying migrations, especially in production environments.

Here's an example of the SQL used in the `up.sql` file:

```sql
ALTER TABLE search_queries ADD COLUMN user_id String;
ALTER TABLE recommendations ADD COLUMN user_id String;
ALTER TABLE rag_queries ADD COLUMN user_id String;
```

And here's an example from the `down.sql` file:

```sql
ALTER TABLE search_queries DROP COLUMN user_id;
ALTER TABLE recommendations DROP COLUMN user_id;
ALTER TABLE rag_queries DROP COLUMN user_id;
```

These scripts demonstrate the straightforward nature of the schema changes, adding or removing a single column across three different tables.
