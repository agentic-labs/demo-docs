## High-level description
This SQL script performs schema modifications to add a `user_id` column of type String to three existing tables: `search_queries`, `recommendations`, and `rag_queries`. These alterations enable user-specific data tracking in these tables.

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE search_queries ADD COLUMN user_id String;
#### Description
This SQL statement adds a new column named `user_id` of type String to the `search_queries` table.

#### Internal Logic
- The `ALTER TABLE` command is used to modify the existing `search_queries` table.
- `ADD COLUMN` specifies that a new column is being added.
- The new column is named `user_id` and has a data type of String.

### ALTER TABLE recommendations ADD COLUMN user_id String;
#### Description
This SQL statement adds a new column named `user_id` of type String to the `recommendations` table.

#### Internal Logic
- The `ALTER TABLE` command is used to modify the existing `recommendations` table.
- `ADD COLUMN` specifies that a new column is being added.
- The new column is named `user_id` and has a data type of String.

### ALTER TABLE rag_queries ADD COLUMN user_id String;
#### Description
This SQL statement adds a new column named `user_id` of type String to the `rag_queries` table.

#### Internal Logic
- The `ALTER TABLE` command is used to modify the existing `rag_queries` table.
- `ADD COLUMN` specifies that a new column is being added.
- The new column is named `user_id` and has a data type of String.

## Side Effects
- The schema of the `search_queries`, `recommendations`, and `rag_queries` tables will be modified.
- Existing rows in these tables will have a `NULL` value for the new `user_id` column unless a default value is specified (which is not the case in this script).
- Any applications or queries that rely on the current structure of these tables may need to be updated to accommodate the new column.

## Performance Considerations
- Depending on the size of the tables and the database system being used, these ALTER TABLE operations could potentially be time-consuming and may temporarily lock the tables.
- It's advisable to run this migration during a maintenance window or low-traffic period to minimize disruption to the application.
