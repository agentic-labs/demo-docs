## High-level description
This SQL script creates a table named `recommendations` in a ClickHouse database. The table is designed to store recommendation data with various attributes, including recommendation types, positive and negative IDs, request parameters, results, and associated metadata. The table uses the MergeTree engine for efficient data storage and retrieval.

## Symbols

### `recommendations` table
#### Description
The `recommendations` table is created to store recommendation-related data. It uses the MergeTree engine, which is optimized for insert and select queries on large datasets.

#### Columns
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | UUID | Unique identifier for each recommendation |
| recommendation_type | String | Type of the recommendation |
| positive_ids | Array(String) | Array of positive IDs associated with the recommendation |
| negative_ids | Array(String) | Array of negative IDs associated with the recommendation |
| positive_tracking_ids | Array(String) | Array of positive tracking IDs |
| negative_tracking_ids | Array(String) | Array of negative tracking IDs |
| request_params | String | Parameters of the recommendation request |
| results | Array(String) | Array of recommendation results |
| top_score | Float32 | Highest score associated with the recommendation |
| dataset_id | UUID | Identifier of the dataset used for the recommendation |
| created_at | DateTime | Timestamp of when the recommendation was created |

#### Internal Logic
1. The table uses the MergeTree engine, which is suitable for write-heavy workloads and efficient data retrieval.
2. The table is ordered by `id` and `created_at`, allowing for fast lookups and range queries on these columns.
3. The table is partitioned by month (derived from `created_at`) and `dataset_id`, which can improve query performance and data management.
4. A TTL (Time To Live) of 30 days is set on the `created_at` column, automatically removing old data.

## Performance Considerations
1. The MergeTree engine provides good performance for both inserts and selects on large datasets.
2. Partitioning by month and dataset_id can improve query performance, especially for time-based and dataset-specific queries.
3. The TTL feature automatically removes old data, which can help manage storage and maintain performance over time.
4. The ordering by `id` and `created_at` allows for efficient range queries and lookups on these columns.

## Dependencies
This SQL script is designed for ClickHouse, a column-oriented database management system. It uses ClickHouse-specific syntax and features, such as:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ClickHouse | The database system for which this table is designed |

## Configuration
The table configuration is embedded in the CREATE TABLE statement:
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| ENGINE | String | MergeTree | Specifies the table engine as MergeTree |
| ORDER BY | Tuple | (id, created_at) | Defines the sorting order of the data |
| PARTITION BY | Tuple | (toYYYYMM(created_at), dataset_id) | Specifies how the data is partitioned |
| TTL | Expression | created_at + INTERVAL 30 DAY | Sets the time-to-live for data rows |
