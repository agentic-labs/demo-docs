title: "down.sql"

## High-level description
This SQL script is designed to drop the `recommendations` table if it exists in the database. It's part of a database migration, specifically the "down" migration, which is used to revert changes made by the corresponding "up" migration.

## Symbols

### `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS recommendations;`
#### Description
This SQL command is used to remove the `recommendations` table from the database schema if it exists.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `IF EXISTS` clause checks if the `recommendations` table is present in the database.
2. If the table exists, it is completely removed from the database schema.
3. If the table doesn't exist, the command does nothing and no error is raised.

## Side Effects
- If the `recommendations` table exists, it will be permanently deleted from the database, including all its data and structure.
- Any dependencies on the `recommendations` table (such as foreign keys, views, or triggers) may be affected or become invalid after this operation.

## Performance Considerations
- This operation is typically fast, but the exact performance impact depends on the size of the table and any associated indexes or constraints.
- On large databases, dropping a table can potentially cause locks or impact concurrent operations, so it's advisable to execute this during maintenance windows or low-traffic periods.

## Error Handling
The `IF EXISTS` clause prevents the script from throwing an error if the table doesn't exist, making the migration more robust and idempotent.
