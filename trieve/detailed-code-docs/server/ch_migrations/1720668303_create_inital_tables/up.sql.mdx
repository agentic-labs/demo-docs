## High-level description
This SQL script creates several tables in a ClickHouse database for managing various aspects of a dataset-centric search and recommendation system. The tables are designed to store information about dataset events, search queries, cluster topics, search cluster memberships, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) queries, and recommendations.

## Code Structure
The script consists of six `CREATE TABLE` statements, each defining a table with specific columns, storage engine, ordering, partitioning, and TTL (Time-To-Live) settings where applicable.

## Symbols

### `dataset_events` Table
#### Description
Stores events related to datasets.

#### Columns
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | UUID | Unique identifier for the event |
| created_at | DateTime | Timestamp of event creation |
| dataset_id | UUID | Identifier of the associated dataset |
| event_type | String | Type of the event |
| event_data | String | Data associated with the event |

#### Internal Logic
- Uses MergeTree engine
- Ordered by dataset_id, created_at, event_type, and id
- Partitioned by month of creation and dataset_id
- TTL of 30 days from creation

### `search_queries` Table
#### Description
Stores information about search queries.

#### Columns
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | UUID | Unique identifier for the search query |
| search_type | String | Type of search performed |
| query | String | The actual search query |
| request_params | String | Parameters of the search request |
| latency | Float32 | Search latency |
| top_score | Float32 | Highest score in search results |
| results | Array(String) | Array of search results |
| query_vector | Array(Float32) | Vector representation of the query |
| dataset_id | UUID | Identifier of the associated dataset |
| created_at | DateTime | Timestamp of query creation |
| is_duplicate | UInt8 | Flag to mark duplicate entries |

#### Internal Logic
- Uses ReplacingMergeTree engine with is_duplicate column
- Ordered by dataset_id, created_at, top_score, latency, and id
- Partitioned by month of creation and dataset_id
- TTL of 30 days from creation

### `cluster_topics` Table
#### Description
Stores information about cluster topics.

#### Columns
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | UUID | Unique identifier for the cluster topic |
| dataset_id | UUID | Identifier of the associated dataset |
| topic | String | The topic of the cluster |
| density | Int32 | Density of the cluster |
| avg_score | Float32 | Average score of the cluster |
| created_at | DateTime | Timestamp of cluster creation |

#### Internal Logic
- Uses MergeTree engine
- Ordered by dataset_id and id
- Partitioned by dataset_id

### `search_cluster_memberships` Table
#### Description
Stores memberships of search queries in clusters.

#### Columns
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | UUID | Unique identifier for the membership |
| search_id | UUID | Identifier of the associated search query |
| cluster_id | UUID | Identifier of the associated cluster |
| distance_to_centroid | Float32 | Distance of the search query to the cluster centroid |

#### Internal Logic
- Uses MergeTree engine
- Ordered by id

### `rag_queries` Table
#### Description
Stores information about RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) queries.

#### Columns
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | UUID | Unique identifier for the RAG query |
| rag_type | String | Type of RAG query |
| user_message | String | User's input message |
| search_id | UUID | Identifier of the associated search query |
| results | Array(String) | Array of query results |
| llm_response | String | Response from the language model |
| dataset_id | UUID | Identifier of the associated dataset |
| created_at | DateTime | Timestamp of query creation |

#### Internal Logic
- Uses MergeTree engine
- Ordered by id and created_at
- Partitioned by month of creation and dataset_id
- TTL of 30 days from creation

### `recommendations` Table
#### Description
Stores information about recommendations.

#### Columns
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | UUID | Unique identifier for the recommendation |
| recommendation_type | String | Type of recommendation |
| positive_ids | Array(String) | Array of positively rated item IDs |
| negative_ids | Array(String) | Array of negatively rated item IDs |
| positive_tracking_ids | Array(String) | Array of positively rated tracking IDs |
| negative_tracking_ids | Array(String) | Array of negatively rated tracking IDs |
| request_params | String | Parameters of the recommendation request |
| results | Array(String) | Array of recommendation results |
| top_score | Float32 | Highest score in recommendation results |
| dataset_id | UUID | Identifier of the associated dataset |
| created_at | DateTime | Timestamp of recommendation creation |

#### Internal Logic
- Uses MergeTree engine
- Ordered by id and created_at
- Partitioned by month of creation and dataset_id
- TTL of 30 days from creation

## Performance Considerations
- The use of MergeTree and ReplacingMergeTree engines allows for efficient data storage and retrieval.
- Partitioning by month and dataset_id helps in organizing data for faster queries.
- TTL settings ensure automatic data cleanup after 30 days for most tables, helping to manage storage.
- Ordering columns are chosen to optimize common query patterns, such as filtering by dataset_id and created_at.
