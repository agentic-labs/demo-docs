## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for creating and dropping several tables in a ClickHouse database. These tables are designed to support a dataset-centric search and recommendation system. The migration consists of two files: `up.sql` for creating the tables and `down.sql` for dropping them.

## What does it do?
The migration scripts set up a database structure to store and manage various aspects of a search and recommendation system:

1. It creates tables to store dataset events, which could be any significant actions or changes related to datasets.
2. It sets up a table for search queries, allowing the system to log and analyze user searches.
3. It establishes a structure for clustering topics, which can be used for organizing and categorizing data.
4. It creates a table to manage search cluster memberships, linking searches to topic clusters.
5. It sets up storage for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) queries, which combine search with language model responses.
6. Finally, it creates a table for storing recommendations, which can be used to track and improve the system's suggestion capabilities.

The `down.sql` script provides a way to revert these changes by dropping all the created tables, ensuring that the database can be rolled back to its previous state if needed.

## Key Files

### up.sql
This file contains the SQL commands to create six tables:

1. `dataset_events`: Stores events related to datasets, including event type and associated data.
2. `search_queries`: Logs search queries, their parameters, results, and performance metrics.
3. `cluster_topics`: Manages information about topic clusters, including density and average score.
4. `search_cluster_memberships`: Links search queries to cluster topics.
5. `rag_queries`: Stores RAG query information, including user messages and language model responses.
6. `recommendations`: Tracks recommendation data, including positive and negative ratings.

Each table is created with specific columns, storage engines (mostly MergeTree), ordering, partitioning, and TTL (Time-To-Live) settings where applicable.

### down.sql
This file contains SQL commands to drop all the tables created by `up.sql`. It uses `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS` statements to ensure that the script can be run safely even if some tables don't exist.

## Dependencies
The migration scripts are designed for ClickHouse, a column-oriented database management system. They rely on ClickHouse's specific features such as:

- MergeTree and ReplacingMergeTree storage engines
- Support for UUID data type
- Array data types
- TTL (Time-To-Live) functionality
- Partitioning and ordering capabilities

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files, the migration scripts contain several configurable aspects:

1. TTL settings: Most tables have a 30-day TTL, which can be adjusted as needed.
2. Partitioning: Tables are partitioned by month and dataset_id, which can be modified to suit different data distribution patterns.
3. Ordering: The columns used for ordering in each table are chosen to optimize common query patterns and can be adjusted based on specific use cases.

Example of TTL and partitioning configuration in the `dataset_events` table:

```sql
ENGINE = MergeTree()
ORDER BY (dataset_id, created_at, event_type, id)
PARTITION BY (toYYYYMM(created_at), dataset_id)
TTL created_at + INTERVAL 30 DAY
```

These settings can be fine-tuned based on the expected data volume, query patterns, and retention requirements of the system.
