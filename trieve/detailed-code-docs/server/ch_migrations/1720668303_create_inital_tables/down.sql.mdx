title: "down.sql"

## High-level description
This SQL script is designed to drop (remove) several tables from a database. It's likely part of a database migration system, specifically the "down" migration that reverts the changes made by a corresponding "up" migration. The script ensures that these tables are removed if they exist, allowing for a clean rollback of the database structure.

## Symbols

### DROP TABLE IF EXISTS statements
#### Description
Each line in this script is a SQL command to drop a table if it exists in the database. The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the command doesn't throw an error if the table is not present.

#### Internal Logic
The script drops the following tables in order:
1. `recommendations`
2. `rag_queries`
3. `search_cluster_memberships`
4. `cluster_topics`
5. `search_queries`
6. `events`

The order of dropping tables is important, especially if there are foreign key constraints between them. Tables with foreign key references should typically be dropped before the tables they reference to avoid constraint violation errors.

## Side Effects
Executing this script will permanently remove the specified tables and all data contained within them from the database. This action is irreversible without a backup or a way to recreate the data.

## Dependencies
This script relies on the SQL database system being used (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) to interpret and execute the DROP TABLE commands.

## Error Handling
The `IF EXISTS` clause in each DROP TABLE statement prevents errors that would occur if attempting to drop a table that doesn't exist. This makes the script more robust and allows it to be run multiple times without failing.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in this script. However, it's worth noting that when creating the corresponding "up" migration, care should be taken to recreate these tables in the correct order, considering any potential foreign key relationships.
