## High-level description
This SQL script adds a new column named `query_rating` to the `search_queries` table. The column is designed to store a rating or classification for search queries, potentially to flag or categorize them based on their quality or characteristics.

### ALTER TABLE statement
#### Description
This SQL statement modifies the structure of the existing `search_queries` table by adding a new column.

#### Internal Logic
1. The statement uses `ALTER TABLE` to modify the `search_queries` table.
2. It adds a new column named `query_rating` using the `ADD COLUMN` clause.
3. The `IF NOT EXISTS` condition is used to prevent errors if the column already exists.
4. The new column is defined with the following characteristics:
   - Data type: `String`
   - Default value: `'0'`

## Side Effects
- This script will modify the schema of the `search_queries` table by adding a new column.
- Existing rows in the table will have the default value '0' for the new `query_rating` column.

## Performance Considerations
- Depending on the database system and the size of the `search_queries` table, this alteration might temporarily lock the table or impact performance during execution.
- After adding the column, queries selecting all columns from this table will now include the new `query_rating` column, potentially affecting the amount of data transferred.

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| query_rating | String | '0' | Stores a rating or classification for search queries |

## Notes
1. The use of `String` type for `query_rating` suggests that the rating might be more complex than a simple numeric value, possibly allowing for categorical ratings or flags.
2. The default value '0' might represent a neutral or unrated state for new or existing queries.
3. This migration is part of a series, as indicated by the filename prefix `1722546114`, which likely represents a timestamp or sequential identifier for database migrations.
