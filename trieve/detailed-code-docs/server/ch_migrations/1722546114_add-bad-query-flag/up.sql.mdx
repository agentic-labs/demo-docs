## High-level description
This SQL script adds a new column named `query_rating` to the `search_queries` table. The column is designed to store a rating or classification for search queries, potentially to flag or categorize them based on their quality or characteristics.

### ALTER TABLE statement
#### Description
This SQL statement modifies the structure of the existing `search_queries` table by adding a new column.

#### Internal Logic
1. The statement uses `ALTER TABLE` to modify the `search_queries` table.
2. It adds a new column named `query_rating` using the `ADD COLUMN` clause.
3. The `IF NOT EXISTS` condition is used to prevent errors if the column already exists.
4. The new column is defined with the following characteristics:
   - Data type: `String`
   - Default value: `'0'`

## Side Effects
- This script will modify the schema of the `search_queries` table by adding a new column.
- Existing rows in the table will have the default value '0' for the new `query_rating` column.

## Performance Considerations
- Depending on the database system and the size of the `search_queries` table, this alteration might temporarily lock the table or impact performance during execution.
- After adding the column, queries selecting all columns (`SELECT *`) from this table will now include the new `query_rating` column, potentially affecting the amount of data transferred.

## Dependencies
This script appears to be part of a database migration system, as indicated by the file path (`ch_migrations/1722546114_add-bad-query-flag/up.sql`). It likely depends on:

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Database migration tool | To execute this SQL script as part of a structured database schema update process |

## Notes
1. The file name suggests that this migration is adding a "bad query flag", but the column name `query_rating` implies a more nuanced rating system rather than a simple flag.
2. The use of `String` as the data type for `query_rating`, with a default value of '0', suggests that the rating might be more complex than a simple boolean flag. It could potentially store different categories or levels of ratings.
3. The migration number (1722546114) in the file path is likely a timestamp or unique identifier for ordering migrations.
