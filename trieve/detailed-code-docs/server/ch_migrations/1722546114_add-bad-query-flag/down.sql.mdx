## High-level description
This SQL script is designed to revert changes made to the `search_queries` table by removing the `query_rating` column. It's part of a database migration system, specifically a "down" migration that undoes a previous "up" migration.

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE statement
#### Description
This SQL statement modifies the structure of the `search_queries` table by removing the `query_rating` column if it exists.

#### Internal Logic
1. The statement targets the `search_queries` table.
2. It attempts to drop the `query_rating` column.
3. The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the operation will not throw an error if the column doesn't exist.

## Side Effects
- Removes the `query_rating` column from the `search_queries` table if it exists.
- This operation will result in the loss of any data stored in the `query_rating` column.

## Dependencies
This script relies on the existence of:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `search_queries` table | The table being modified |

## Error Handling
The `IF EXISTS` clause provides a basic form of error handling, preventing the script from failing if the column doesn't exist.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in this script.
