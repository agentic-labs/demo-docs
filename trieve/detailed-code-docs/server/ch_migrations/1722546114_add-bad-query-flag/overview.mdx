## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for adding a new `query_rating` column to the `search_queries` table in a database. The migration is part of a versioned database schema change system, identified by the timestamp or sequential identifier 1722546114. The directory includes both "up" and "down" migration scripts, allowing for the application and reversal of this database change.

## What does it do?
These scripts modify the structure of a database table called `search_queries`. The "up" migration adds a new column called `query_rating`, which is designed to store a rating or classification for search queries. This could be used to flag or categorize queries based on their quality or other characteristics. The "down" migration provides a way to undo this change by removing the `query_rating` column if needed.

The `query_rating` column is added as a String type with a default value of '0'. This suggests that the rating system might be more complex than a simple numeric scale, possibly allowing for categorical ratings or flags. The default value '0' likely represents a neutral or unrated state for new or existing queries.

## Key Files

1. `up.sql`: This file contains the SQL script to add the `query_rating` column to the `search_queries` table. Here's the key content:

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE search_queries
   ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS query_rating String DEFAULT '0'
   ```

   This script uses the `ALTER TABLE` statement to modify the `search_queries` table, adding the new `query_rating` column if it doesn't already exist.

2. `down.sql`: This file contains the SQL script to remove the `query_rating` column from the `search_queries` table. The key content is:

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE search_queries
   DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS query_rating
   ```

   This script uses the `ALTER TABLE` statement to remove the `query_rating` column if it exists, effectively undoing the changes made by the "up" migration.

## Configuration
The migration scripts define the following configuration for the new `query_rating` column:

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| query_rating | String | '0' | Stores a rating or classification for search queries |

## Dependencies
These migration scripts rely on the existence of the `search_queries` table in the database. They are designed to work with a database system that supports standard SQL ALTER TABLE statements.

## Performance Considerations
When applying these migrations, especially on large tables, there may be temporary performance impacts:

1. The alteration of the table structure might temporarily lock the `search_queries` table or impact database performance during execution.
2. After adding the `query_rating` column, queries selecting all columns from the `search_queries` table will now include this new column, potentially increasing the amount of data transferred in query results.

## Error Handling
Both scripts use conditional clauses to prevent errors:
- The "up" migration uses `IF NOT EXISTS` when adding the column to avoid errors if the column already exists.
- The "down" migration uses `IF EXISTS` when dropping the column to avoid errors if the column doesn't exist.

These precautions make the migrations more robust and allow them to be run multiple times without causing errors.
