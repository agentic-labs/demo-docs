## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for adding a new `query_rating` column to the `search_queries` table in a database. The migration is part of a feature to add a rating or classification system for search queries, possibly to flag or categorize them based on their quality or characteristics.

## What does it do?
The migration scripts in this directory perform the following actions:

1. Add a new column: The "up" migration adds a `query_rating` column to the `search_queries` table. This column is of type `String` and has a default value of '0'. This allows for storing a rating or classification for each search query in the database.

2. Remove the column: The "down" migration removes the `query_rating` column from the `search_queries` table, effectively undoing the changes made by the "up" migration.

These scripts enable database administrators or application developers to easily add or remove the `query_rating` feature from the database schema, allowing for flexible management of the database structure as the application evolves.

## Key Files

1. `up.sql`: This file contains the SQL script to add the `query_rating` column to the `search_queries` table. Here's the content of the file:

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE search_queries
   ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS query_rating String DEFAULT '0'
   ```

   This script modifies the `search_queries` table by adding a new `query_rating` column of type `String` with a default value of '0'. The `IF NOT EXISTS` clause prevents errors if the column already exists.

2. `down.sql`: This file contains the SQL script to remove the `query_rating` column from the `search_queries` table. Here's the content of the file:

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE search_queries
   DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS query_rating
   ```

   This script removes the `query_rating` column from the `search_queries` table. The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the operation doesn't throw an error if the column doesn't exist.

## Dependencies
The migration scripts depend on the existence of the `search_queries` table in the database. They are designed to be run by a database migration tool, which is responsible for executing these scripts in the correct order and managing the state of the database schema.

## Configuration
The migration is identified by the number `1722546114` in the directory name, which is likely a timestamp or unique identifier used by the migration system to order and track migrations. This number ensures that migrations are applied in the correct sequence.

It's worth noting that while the directory name suggests adding a "bad query flag", the actual implementation uses a `query_rating` column. This implies that the feature might have evolved from a simple flag to a more nuanced rating system. The use of a `String` type for the rating, with a default value of '0', suggests that the rating system might support multiple categories or levels beyond a simple boolean flag.

When implementing the feature that uses this new column, developers should consider the following:

1. The meaning of different rating values (e.g., what does '0' signify compared to other possible values?)
2. How the rating will be assigned and updated in the application logic
3. How to handle existing rows in the table, which will have the default rating of '0' after the migration

These migration scripts provide a foundation for implementing a query rating system, but the actual logic for assigning and using these ratings would need to be implemented in the application code that interacts with this database table.
