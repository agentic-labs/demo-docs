## High-level description
This SQL script adds a new column named 'type' of String data type to the 'ctr_data' table. This migration is part of a database schema update, likely to introduce a new attribute for categorizing or classifying data in the ctr_data table.

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE ctr_data ADD COLUMN type String;
#### Description
This SQL statement modifies the structure of the 'ctr_data' table by adding a new column named 'type'.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ctr_data | Table | The existing table to be altered |

#### Outputs
The 'ctr_data' table is modified with a new column added.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `ALTER TABLE` command is used to modify the structure of the 'ctr_data' table.
2. The `ADD COLUMN` clause specifies that a new column should be added to the table.
3. The new column is named 'type'.
4. The data type of the new column is set to 'String', which will store text data.

## Side Effects
- This migration will modify the schema of the 'ctr_data' table.
- Existing rows in the 'ctr_data' table will have a NULL value for the new 'type' column unless a default value is specified (which is not the case in this script).
- Any queries or applications that interact with the 'ctr_data' table may need to be updated to account for the new 'type' column.

## Performance Considerations
- Adding a new column to an existing table with a large number of rows can be a potentially time-consuming operation, depending on the database system and the size of the table.
- The impact on performance during the migration will depend on factors such as the current size of the 'ctr_data' table and the database management system being used.

## Dependencies
This SQL script appears to be database-agnostic and should work with most SQL-compliant database systems. However, the specific syntax (particularly the use of 'String' as a data type) suggests it might be tailored for a particular database system, possibly ClickHouse, given the file naming convention (ch_migrations).

Note: The file name suggests this is a ClickHouse migration script, as 'ch' often stands for ClickHouse in database contexts. The use of 'String' as a data type is consistent with ClickHouse SQL dialect.
