## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for adding a new 'type' column to the 'ctr_data' table in a database. It includes both 'up' and 'down' migration scripts, allowing for the application and reversal of this schema change.

## What does it do?
The scripts in this directory modify the structure of a database table called 'ctr_data'. The 'up' migration adds a new column named 'type' to store additional categorization or classification data for each record. The 'down' migration provides a way to undo this change by removing the 'type' column if needed.

These migrations allow developers to:
1. Add a new attribute to the 'ctr_data' table, potentially enabling more detailed data classification or filtering.
2. Revert the database schema to its previous state if needed, providing flexibility in managing database changes.

## Key Files

### up.sql
This file contains the SQL command to add the 'type' column to the 'ctr_data' table. The command is:

```sql
ALTER TABLE ctr_data ADD COLUMN type String;
```

This adds a new column named 'type' with a String data type to the 'ctr_data' table.

### down.sql
This file contains the SQL command to remove the 'type' column from the 'ctr_data' table. The command is:

```sql
ALTER TABLE ctr_data DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS type;
```

This removes the 'type' column from the 'ctr_data' table if it exists, effectively undoing the change made by the 'up' migration.

## Side Effects
- Executing the 'up' migration will modify the schema of the 'ctr_data' table, adding a new 'type' column.
- Existing rows in the 'ctr_data' table will have NULL values for the new 'type' column unless a default value is specified (which is not the case in this script).
- Executing the 'down' migration will remove the 'type' column and any data it contains from the 'ctr_data' table.
- Applications or queries that interact with the 'ctr_data' table may need to be updated to account for the presence or absence of the 'type' column, depending on which migration has been applied.

## Performance Considerations
- Adding or removing a column from a large table can be a time-consuming operation, depending on the database system and table size.
- These operations may briefly lock the 'ctr_data' table, potentially impacting concurrent database operations.
- The performance impact will vary based on factors such as the current size of the 'ctr_data' table and the specific database management system in use.

## Dependencies
These migration scripts assume the existence of a 'ctr_data' table in the database. If this table doesn't exist, the migrations will fail.

## Error Handling
The 'down' migration uses the 'IF EXISTS' clause when dropping the column, preventing errors if the column doesn't exist. This provides a basic level of error handling for the removal process.

In conclusion, this directory contains a pair of SQL migration scripts designed to add and remove a 'type' column from the 'ctr_data' table, allowing for flexible management of the database schema in a version-controlled manner.
