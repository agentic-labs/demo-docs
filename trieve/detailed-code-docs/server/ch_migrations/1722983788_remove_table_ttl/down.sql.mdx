## High-level description
This SQL script is designed to revert changes made to several tables in a database. It specifically adds a Time-To-Live (TTL) clause to five different tables, setting the TTL to 30 days after the `created_at` timestamp for each record.

### ALTER TABLE statements
#### Description
Each `ALTER TABLE` statement modifies a specific table to add a TTL clause. The TTL is set to expire records 30 days after their creation date.

#### Internal Logic
For each table, the script:
1. Identifies the table to be altered
2. Uses the `MODIFY TTL` clause to set the TTL
3. Calculates the expiration time as `created_at + INTERVAL 30 DAY`

The affected tables are:
1. `dataset_events`
2. `search_queries`
3. `rag_queries`
4. `recommendations`
5. `ctr_data`

## Side Effects
Executing this script will modify the structure of the specified tables, adding a TTL clause to each. This will cause records in these tables to be automatically deleted 30 days after their creation date.

## Performance Considerations
Adding TTL clauses can impact database performance, particularly for large tables:
- It may increase the overhead of insert operations slightly.
- It will trigger automatic deletion processes, which could affect query performance during cleanup operations.
- It can help manage database size by automatically removing old data, potentially improving overall performance in the long run.

## Error Handling
This script does not include explicit error handling. If a table doesn't exist or if the `created_at` column is missing from any table, the SQL execution will fail.

## Configuration
The TTL interval is hard-coded to 30 days for all tables. If different retention periods are needed for different tables, the script would need to be modified.

## TODOs
Consider adding error handling or checks to ensure tables and columns exist before attempting to modify them.
