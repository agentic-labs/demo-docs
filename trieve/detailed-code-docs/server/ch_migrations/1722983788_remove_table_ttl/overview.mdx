## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for removing Time-To-Live (TTL) settings from five specific tables in a database. The migration consists of two files: `up.sql` for applying the changes (removing TTL) and `down.sql` for reverting the changes (re-adding TTL).

## What does it do?
The migration scripts in this directory modify the structure of five database tables:
1. `dataset_events`
2. `search_queries`
3. `rag_queries`
4. `recommendations`
5. `ctr_data`

The `up.sql` script removes the TTL settings from these tables, which means that the data in these tables will no longer be automatically deleted after a certain period. This allows the data to persist indefinitely in the database.

The `down.sql` script does the opposite by adding back the TTL settings to these tables. It sets a 30-day TTL for each table, meaning that records will be automatically deleted 30 days after their creation date.

These changes affect how long data is retained in the database and can have implications for storage, performance, and data management strategies.

## Key Files

### up.sql
This file contains SQL statements to remove the TTL settings from the five specified tables. Here's an example of one of the statements:

```sql
ALTER TABLE dataset_events REMOVE TTL;
```

This statement is repeated for each of the five tables, effectively disabling automatic data expiration for all of them.

### down.sql
This file contains SQL statements to add back the TTL settings to the five tables. Each statement sets a 30-day TTL based on the `created_at` column. Here's an example:

```sql
ALTER TABLE dataset_events MODIFY TTL created_at + INTERVAL 30 DAY;
```

This pattern is repeated for all five tables, ensuring that if the migration needs to be rolled back, the original TTL settings are restored.

## Configuration
The migration scripts do not use any external configuration files or environment variables. However, there are some implicit configuration aspects to note:

1. Table names: The scripts are hardcoded to work with five specific table names. If these table names change or if additional tables need similar treatment, the scripts would need to be modified.

2. TTL duration: In the `down.sql` script, the TTL duration is set to 30 days for all tables. This is a fixed value and would need to be changed in the script if a different retention period is desired.

3. TTL column: The scripts assume that each table has a `created_at` column which is used as the basis for the TTL calculation. If this column name changes or if a different column should be used, the scripts would need to be updated.

## Performance Considerations
While the execution of these migration scripts is likely to be quick and straightforward, the changes they implement can have significant performance implications:

1. Removing TTL (up.sql):
   - Tables may grow larger over time as old data is no longer automatically removed.
   - This could lead to increased storage requirements and potentially slower query performance on large datasets.
   - Backup and maintenance operations may take longer as the amount of data increases.

2. Adding TTL (down.sql):
   - Implementing TTL can help manage database size by automatically removing old data.
   - There may be a slight overhead on insert operations.
   - Periodic cleanup operations triggered by TTL could impact database performance.

It's important to consider these factors when deciding whether to apply or revert this migration, and to plan for appropriate data management strategies based on the chosen approach.

## TODOs
While not explicitly stated in the scripts, there are some potential improvements that could be considered:

1. Error handling: Add checks to ensure tables and columns exist before attempting to modify them.
2. Configurability: Consider making the TTL duration configurable, perhaps through environment variables or a configuration file.
3. Data management strategy: If removing TTL, implement alternative data retention policies or archiving strategies to manage long-term data growth.
4. Performance monitoring: Set up monitoring to track the impact of these changes on database size and query performance over time.

By addressing these points, the migration scripts could be made more robust and flexible for different deployment scenarios.
