## High-level description
This file, `server/src/data/mod.rs`, is a module declaration file that defines the structure of the `data` module in the server application. It exposes two submodules: `models` and `schema`.

## Code Structure
The file contains two public module declarations:
1. `pub mod models;`: This exposes the `models` submodule.
2. `pub mod schema;`: This exposes the `schema` submodule.

These declarations make the contents of the `models` and `schema` modules available to other parts of the application that import the `data` module.

## Symbols

### `models`
#### Description
This is a public submodule that likely contains data models used throughout the application. Based on the related code snippet, it appears to include various structs and implementations for database entities and data transfer objects.

### `schema`
#### Description
This is a public submodule that likely contains database schema definitions. It's common for this module to define table structures and relationships using an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) system.

## Dependencies
The `data` module doesn't directly import any external dependencies in this file. However, the submodules it exposes (`models` and `schema`) likely have their own dependencies, as seen in the related code snippet for the `models` module.

## Notes
1. This module structure is typical for Rust applications using a database, where `models` contain the data structures and `schema` defines the database layout.
2. The actual implementations and details of these submodules are not visible in this file, but they are made accessible to other parts of the application through these public declarations.
3. The related code snippet for the `models` module shows a complex set of data structures and implementations, indicating that this is a substantial part of the application's data layer.

This module serves as an entry point for the application's data-related functionality, providing a clean separation of concerns between data models and database schema definitions.
