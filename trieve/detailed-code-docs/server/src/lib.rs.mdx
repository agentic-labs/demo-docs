Here's a high-level description of the server/src/lib.rs file:

This file serves as the main library module for the Trieve server application. It sets up the server configuration, defines API routes, initializes database connections, and configures various middleware and services. The file also includes OpenAPI documentation for the API endpoints and implements error handling and logging functionality.

## Code Structure

The code is organized into several main sections:

1. External crate imports and module declarations
2. Constants and configuration settings
3. Database connection and migration functions
4. OpenAPI documentation setup
5. Server setup and configuration
6. Route definitions and handlers
7. Error handling and middleware

The main symbols in the code are interconnected as follows:

- The `main()` function sets up the server configuration and starts the HTTP server.
- The `MIGRATIONS` constant is used in the `run_migrations()` function to apply database migrations.
- The `ApiDoc` struct defines the OpenAPI documentation, which is used in the server setup to provide API documentation endpoints.
- Various handler functions are defined in separate modules and imported here to be used in route definitions.

## Symbols

### `main()`

#### Description
The main entry point for the server application. It sets up logging, database connections, Redis, and starts the HTTP server with all the configured routes and middleware.

#### Internal Logic
1. Initialize logging and Sentry monitoring if configured
2. Set up database connection pool
3. Configure Redis connection pool
4. Initialize OpenAPI documentation
5. Set up HTTP server with routes, middleware, and services
6. Start the server on the specified port

### `run_migrations()`

#### Description
Runs pending database migrations using Diesel.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| url | &str | Database connection URL |

#### Internal Logic
1. Establish a database connection
2. Run pending migrations using the `MIGRATIONS` constant

### `establish_connection()`

#### Description
Creates an asynchronous database connection using the provided configuration.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| config | &str | Database connection configuration string |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| - | BoxFuture&lt;diesel::ConnectionResult&lt;diesel_async::AsyncPgConnection&gt;&gt; | Future resolving to a database connection |

#### Internal Logic
1. Set up SSL configuration
2. Establish a connection to the database
3. Spawn a background task to handle the connection
4. Convert the connection to an async Diesel connection

### `ApiDoc`

#### Description
Struct defining the OpenAPI documentation for the API. It includes information about all the endpoints, request/response schemas, and security requirements.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| actix-web | Web framework for building the HTTP server |
| diesel | ORM for database operations |
| utoipa | OpenAPI documentation generation |
| sentry | Error monitoring and reporting |
| redis | Caching and session management |
| openssl | SSL/TLS support for database connections |

## Configuration

The application uses environment variables for configuration. Some key options include:

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| DATABASE_URL | String | - | Database connection URL |
| REDIS_URL | String | - | Redis connection URL |
| SENTRY_URL | String | - | Sentry monitoring URL |
| OPENAI_API_KEY | String | - | OpenAI API key for embeddings |
| QDRANT_URL | String | - | Qdrant vector database URL |
| QDRANT_API_KEY | String | - | Qdrant API key |

## Error Handling

The application uses a custom `ServiceError` enum for error handling. It implements the `ResponseError` trait from actix-web to convert errors into HTTP responses.

## Logging

The application uses the `tracing` crate for logging. It sets up a subscriber with console output and Sentry integration if configured.

## API/Interface Reference

The API is documented using OpenAPI 3.0 specification. The `ApiDoc` struct defines all the endpoints, their parameters, request/response bodies, and security requirements. The documentation is served at the `/redoc` and `/swagger-ui` endpoints.
