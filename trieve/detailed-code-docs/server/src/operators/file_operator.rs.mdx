Here's a comprehensive documentation of the `file_operator.rs` file:

## High-level description
This file contains operations related to file handling in the Trieve server. It includes functions for interacting with AWS S3, creating and managing files and their associated chunks, and querying file metadata.

## Code Structure
The file defines several functions that interact with the database, AWS S3, and other parts of the system to handle file-related operations. These functions are used by other parts of the application, particularly the file handling routes.

## Symbols

### `get_aws_bucket`
#### Description
Creates and returns an AWS S3 Bucket instance based on environment variables.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Result | Result&lt;Bucket, ServiceError&gt; | An S3 Bucket instance or an error |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves AWS configuration from environment variables.
2. Creates an AWS region and credentials.
3. Creates and returns a new S3 Bucket instance.

### `create_file_query`
#### Description
Creates a new file record in the database.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| file_id | uuid::Uuid | The ID of the file |
| file_size | i64 | The size of the file |
| upload_file_data | UploadFileReqPayload | File upload data |
| dataset_id | uuid::Uuid | The ID of the dataset |
| pool | web::Data&lt;Pool&gt; | Database connection pool |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Result | Result&lt;File, ServiceError&gt; | The created file record or an error |

#### Internal Logic
1. Connects to the database.
2. Creates a new File instance from the provided details.
3. Inserts the new file record into the database.

### `create_file_chunks`
#### Description
Creates chunks from a file's HTML content and stores them in the database.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| created_file_id | uuid::Uuid | The ID of the created file |
| upload_file_data | UploadFileReqPayload | File upload data |
| html_content | String | HTML content of the file |
| dataset_org_plan_sub | DatasetAndOrgWithSubAndPlan | Dataset, organization, and subscription information |
| pool | web::Data&lt;Pool&gt; | Database connection pool |
| event_queue | web::Data&lt;EventQueue&gt; | Event queue for notifications |
| redis_conn | MultiplexedConnection | Redis connection |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Result | Result&lt;(), ServiceError&gt; | Success or an error |

#### Internal Logic
1. Converts HTML to text and splits it into chunks.
2. Creates chunk metadata and groups.
3. Checks chunk count against plan limits.
4. Pushes chunk ingestion messages to Redis.
5. Sends a file uploaded event.

### `get_file_query`
#### Description
Retrieves file metadata and generates a signed S3 URL for file download.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| file_uuid | uuid::Uuid | The ID of the file |
| dataset_id | uuid::Uuid | The ID of the dataset |
| pool | web::Data&lt;Pool&gt; | Database connection pool |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Result | Result&lt;FileDTO, actix_web::Error&gt; | File metadata with signed URL or an error |

#### Internal Logic
1. Queries the database for file metadata.
2. Generates a presigned S3 URL for file download.
3. Returns file metadata with the signed URL.

### `get_dataset_file_query`
#### Description
Retrieves files for a specific dataset with pagination.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| dataset_id | uuid::Uuid | The ID of the dataset |
| page | u64 | Page number for pagination |
| pool | web::Data&lt;Pool&gt; | Database connection pool |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Result | Result&lt;Vec&lt;(File, i64, Option&lt;uuid::Uuid&gt;)&gt;, actix_web::Error&gt; | List of files with metadata or an error |

#### Internal Logic
1. Queries the database for files in the specified dataset.
2. Applies pagination.
3. Returns a list of files with their metadata and associated group IDs.

### `delete_file_query`
#### Description
Deletes a file from S3 and removes its record from the database.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| file_uuid | uuid::Uuid | The ID of the file to delete |
| dataset | Dataset | The dataset the file belongs to |
| pool | web::Data&lt;Pool&gt; | Database connection pool |
| dataset_config | DatasetConfiguration | Dataset configuration |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Result | Result&lt;(), actix_web::Error&gt; | Success or an error |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves file metadata from the database.
2. Deletes the file from S3.
3. Removes the file record from the database in a transaction.

## Dependencies
- `super::chunk_operator`: For creating chunk metadata and querying chunk counts.
- `super::clickhouse_operator`: For handling events.
- `super::group_operator`: For creating groups from files.
- `super::parse_operator`: For text processing and chunking.
- Various Diesel and database-related modules for database operations.
- AWS S3 related modules for interacting with S3.

## Error Handling
The code uses a `ServiceError` enum for error handling, which is propagated up the call stack. Errors are logged and, in some cases, captured by Sentry for monitoring.

## Performance Considerations
- The code uses connection pooling for database operations to improve performance.
- File uploads and chunk creation are handled asynchronously to avoid blocking operations.
- Presigned URLs are used for S3 operations to offload file transfer to the client.

This documentation provides an overview of the main functionalities in the `file_operator.rs` file. Each function is responsible for a specific aspect of file handling, from creation and storage to retrieval and deletion, integrating with various parts of the Trieve server ecosystem.
