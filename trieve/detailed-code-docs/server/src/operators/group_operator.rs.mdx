title: "group_operator.rs"
---

Here's a high-level description of the `group_operator.rs` file:

The `group_operator.rs` file contains functions and structures related to managing chunk groups in the Trieve system. It provides operations for creating, updating, deleting, and querying chunk groups, as well as managing the relationships between chunks and groups. The file includes database queries, API endpoint handlers, and utility functions for working with chunk groups.

## Code Structure

The file is organized into several main sections:

1. Database query functions: These functions interact with the database to perform CRUD operations on chunk groups and their relationships with chunks.

2. API endpoint handlers: These functions handle HTTP requests for chunk group operations, such as creating groups, updating groups, and retrieving group information.

3. Helper functions: These functions assist in various tasks related to chunk groups, such as data validation and conversion.

4. Data structures: The file defines several structs and enums used for representing chunk group data and API request/response payloads.

## Symbols

Here are some of the key symbols in the code:
