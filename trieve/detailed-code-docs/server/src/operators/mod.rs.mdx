This code defines the `operators` module for the server application. Here's a high-level description of the module's purpose and main functionality:

The `operators` module contains various submodules that handle different aspects of the server's operations. These submodules include:

1. `analytics_operator`: Handles analytics-related operations.
2. `chunk_operator`: Manages operations related to chunks of data.
3. `clickhouse_operator`: Interacts with ClickHouse database.
4. `dataset_operator`: Handles dataset-related operations.
5. `email_operator`: Manages email operations.
6. `event_operator`: Handles event-related operations.
7. `file_operator`: Manages file operations.
8. `group_operator`: Handles group-related operations.
9. `invitation_operator`: Manages invitation operations.
10. `message_operator`: Handles message-related operations.
11. `model_operator`: Manages model operations.
12. `organization_operator`: Handles organization-related operations.
13. `parse_operator`: Manages parsing operations.
14. `qdrant_operator`: Interacts with Qdrant vector database.
15. `search_operator`: Handles search-related operations.
16. `stripe_operator`: Manages Stripe payment operations.
17. `topic_operator`: Handles topic-related operations.
18. `user_operator`: Manages user-related operations.

These submodules work together to provide the core functionality of the server application, handling various aspects of data processing, storage, retrieval, and user interactions.

## Code Structure

The `mod.rs` file serves as the main entry point for the `operators` module. It declares and makes public all the submodules mentioned above. This structure allows other parts of the application to import and use the functionality provided by these submodules.

## References

The `operators` module is likely referenced by other parts of the application, such as route handlers, middleware, and other business logic components that need to perform specific operations related to the functionality provided by these submodules.
