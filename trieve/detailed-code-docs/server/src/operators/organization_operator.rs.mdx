Here's a high-level description and documentation of the `organization_operator.rs` file:

## High-level description

This file contains functions for managing organizations within the Trieve system. It includes operations such as creating, updating, and deleting organizations, as well as querying organization data and usage statistics. The functions interact with a database (likely PostgreSQL) and a Redis cache to perform these operations.

## Code Structure

The file consists of several asynchronous functions that handle different aspects of organization management. These functions typically take a database pool (`Pool`) as an argument and return `Result` types, handling potential errors using the custom `ServiceError` type.

## Symbols

### `create_organization_query`
#### Description
Creates a new organization with a given name.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| name | &str | The name of the organization to create |
| pool | web::Data&lt;Pool&gt; | Database connection pool |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Result&lt;Organization, ServiceError&gt; | Result | The created organization or an error |

#### Internal Logic
- Generates a new `Organization` struct with a random UUID and the provided name
- Attempts to insert the new organization into the database
- If a name conflict occurs, generates a random organization name and retries

### `update_organization_query`
#### Description
Updates an existing organization's name and clears related Redis cache entries.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | uuid::Uuid | The ID of the organization to update |
| name | &str | The new name for the organization |
| pool | web::Data&lt;Pool&gt; | Database connection pool |
| redis_pool | web::Data&lt;RedisPool&gt; | Redis connection pool |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Result&lt;Organization, ServiceError&gt; | Result | The updated organization or an error |

#### Internal Logic
- Updates the organization's name and timestamp in the database
- Fetches all users associated with the organization
- Clears Redis cache entries for all associated users

### `delete_organization_query`
#### Description
Soft-deletes an organization and its associated data.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| req | Option&lt;&HttpRequest&gt; | Optional HTTP request |
| calling_user_id | Option&lt;uuid::Uuid&gt; | ID of the user initiating the deletion |
| org_id | uuid::Uuid | ID of the organization to delete |
| pool | web::Data&lt;Pool&gt; | Database connection pool |
| redis_pool | web::Data&lt;RedisPool&gt; | Redis connection pool |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Result&lt;(), ServiceError&gt; | Result | Success or an error |

#### Internal Logic
- Clears Redis cache entries for all users in the organization
- Deletes associated Stripe subscription if exists
- Soft-deletes all datasets belonging to the organization
- Marks the organization as deleted in the database
- Adds the organization ID to a Redis set of deleted organizations

### Other Functions
The file includes several other functions for querying organization data, usage statistics, and performing various operations related to organizations. These functions follow similar patterns of interacting with the database and Redis cache.

## Error Handling
The functions in this file use the `ServiceError` type to handle and propagate errors. Common error scenarios include database connection issues, query execution failures, and data inconsistencies.

## Dependencies
This file relies on several external crates and internal modules, including:
- `actix_web` for web-related functionality
- `diesel` and `diesel_async` for database operations
- `redis` for caching
- Custom error types and models from the project's modules

The code makes extensive use of asynchronous programming with the `async/await` syntax and handles database transactions and Redis operations in a concurrent manner.
