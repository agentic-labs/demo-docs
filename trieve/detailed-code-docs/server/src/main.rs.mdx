## High-level description
This is the main entry point for the Trieve server application. It delegates the main functionality to the `trieve_server::main()` function, which is defined in a separate module.

## Symbols

### `main`
#### Description
The `main` function is the entry point of the Rust program. It calls the `trieve_server::main()` function and returns its result.

#### Inputs
This function takes no inputs.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Result | `std::io::Result&lt;()&gt;` | The result of running the server, which can be either success (Ok) or an I/O error (Err) |

#### Internal Logic
1. The function simply calls `trieve_server::main()`.
2. The result of this call is implicitly returned.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| trieve_server | Contains the main server implementation |

## Notes
1. This main function is very minimal, serving only as an entry point that delegates to the actual server implementation.
2. The use of `std::io::Result&lt;()&gt;` suggests that the server implementation may perform I/O operations that could potentially fail.
3. Error handling is implicitly done by returning the Result type, allowing the Rust runtime to handle any errors that might occur during server execution.
