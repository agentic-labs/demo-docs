## High-level description
This Rust module provides a utility function for generating random organization names. It combines two randomly selected four-letter words from a predefined list to create unique and memorable organization names.

## Symbols

### `random_organization_name`
#### Description
This function generates a random organization name by combining two four-letter words from a predefined list. The words are separated by a hyphen.

#### Inputs
This function takes no inputs.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| - | String | A randomly generated organization name |

#### Internal Logic
1. The function reads a list of four-letter words from a file named "4-letter-words.txt" using the `include_str!` macro.
2. It creates a random number generator using `rand::thread_rng()`.
3. Two random indices are generated within the range of the word list's length.
4. The function selects two words from the list using these random indices.
5. Finally, it formats and returns the organization name by combining the two selected words with a hyphen.

#### Performance Considerations
The function uses `include_str!` macro, which includes the content of the file at compile-time. This approach is efficient for small, static files as it avoids runtime file I/O operations.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rand | Used for generating random numbers |
| tracing | Used for instrumenting the function for tracing purposes |

## Error Handling
This function does not implement explicit error handling. It assumes that the "4-letter-words.txt" file exists and is properly formatted. If the file is missing or empty, the function may panic at runtime.

## Logging
The function is instrumented with the `#[tracing::instrument]` attribute, which allows for automatic tracing of function calls and their parameters when used with a tracing system.

## TODOs
- Consider adding error handling for cases where the word file might be missing or empty.
- The function could be extended to allow customization of the word list or the number of words in the generated name.
- Performance optimization might be needed if this function is called frequently, as it reads the file and creates a new RNG instance on each call.
