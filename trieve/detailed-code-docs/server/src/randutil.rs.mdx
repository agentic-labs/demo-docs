## High-level description
This Rust module provides a utility function for generating random organization names. It combines two randomly selected 4-letter words from a predefined list to create unique and memorable organization names.

## Symbols

### `random_organization_name`
#### Description
This function generates a random organization name by combining two 4-letter words from a predefined list. It uses the `rand` crate for random number generation and is instrumented with tracing for observability.

#### Inputs
This function takes no inputs.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| - | String | A randomly generated organization name consisting of two 4-letter words separated by a hyphen |

#### Internal Logic
1. Reads a list of 4-letter words from an embedded text file ("4-letter-words.txt").
2. Collects the words into a vector.
3. Generates two random indices using a thread-local random number generator.
4. Selects two words from the vector using the random indices.
5. Formats and returns the selected words as a hyphenated string.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rand | Used for random number generation |
| tracing | Used for instrumenting the function for observability |

## Error Handling
This function does not implement explicit error handling. It assumes that the "4-letter-words.txt" file is present and correctly formatted.

## Performance Considerations
The function reads and processes the word list on each call, which may impact performance for frequent invocations. Consider caching the word list for improved efficiency in high-frequency usage scenarios.

## TODOs
- Consider caching the word list to improve performance for repeated calls.
- Implement error handling for file reading and processing.
- Add configuration options for customizing the word list or separator character.
