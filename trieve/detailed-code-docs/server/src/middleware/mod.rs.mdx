title: "mod.rs"
---

## High-level description
This code defines a module structure for middleware components in a server application. It includes three submodules: `api_version`, `auth_middleware`, and `json_middleware`, which are likely used to handle API versioning, authentication, and JSON processing respectively in the server's request-response cycle.

## Code Structure
The `mod.rs` file serves as the entry point for the middleware module, declaring and exposing three submodules. These submodules can be accessed from other parts of the application using the `pub` keyword.

## Symbols

### `api_version`
#### Description
A public submodule that likely contains functionality for handling API versioning.

### `auth_middleware`
#### Description
A public submodule that probably implements authentication-related middleware.

### `json_middleware`
#### Description
A public submodule that likely handles JSON processing in the request-response cycle.

## Dependencies
This file doesn't directly import any external libraries or modules. However, it organizes and exposes internal modules that may have their own dependencies.

## References
While the `mod.rs` file itself doesn't reference other parts of the codebase, it makes the following modules available for use in other parts of the application:
- `server::middleware::api_version`
- `server::middleware::auth_middleware`
- `server::middleware::json_middleware`

Based on the related code snippet provided for `api_version.rs`, we can infer that at least the `api_version` module has significant functionality related to API versioning, including version detection, request processing, and response modification.
