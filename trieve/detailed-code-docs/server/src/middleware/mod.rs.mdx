title: "mod.rs"
---

## High-level description
This code defines a module structure for middleware components in a Rust server application. It includes three submodules: `api_version`, `auth_middleware`, and `json_middleware`, which are likely used to handle API versioning, authentication, and JSON processing respectively.

## Code Structure
The `mod.rs` file serves as the entry point for the middleware module, declaring three submodules. These submodules are made public, allowing them to be used by other parts of the application.

## Symbols

### `api_version`
#### Description
A public module that likely contains functionality for handling API versioning.

### `auth_middleware`
#### Description
A public module that probably implements authentication-related middleware.

### `json_middleware`
#### Description
A public module that likely handles JSON processing in the middleware pipeline.

## Dependencies
This file doesn't directly depend on any external libraries. However, it organizes the middleware components that may have their own dependencies.

Based on the related code snippet provided for `api_version.rs`, we can infer more details about the `api_version` module:

### `APIVersion` (from api_version.rs)
#### Description
An enum representing different API versions (V1 and V2).

#### Inputs
N/A (It's an enum)

#### Outputs
N/A (It's an enum)

### `ApiVersionCheckFactory` (from api_version.rs)
#### Description
A struct that implements the `Transform` trait, used to create the API version middleware.

### `ApiVersionMiddleware` (from api_version.rs)
#### Description
The actual middleware struct that handles API version checking and setting.

#### Internal Logic
1. Extracts the API version from the request headers or determines it based on the dataset creation date.
2. Inserts the API version into the request extensions.
3. Adds the API version to the response headers.

This middleware is crucial for maintaining backward compatibility and managing different API versions in the application.

Note: The `auth_middleware` and `json_middleware` modules are not provided in the related code snippets, so we cannot provide detailed information about their implementation.
