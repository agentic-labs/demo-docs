## High-level description
This code defines a middleware for Actix Web that ensures JSON content type is set for incoming requests. It also provides a factory for creating this middleware.

## Code Structure
The code consists of two main structures: `JsonMiddleware` and `JsonMiddlewareFactory`. The `JsonMiddleware` implements the `Service` trait, while `JsonMiddlewareFactory` implements the `Transform` trait. These structures work together to provide the middleware functionality.

## Symbols

### `JsonMiddleware&lt;S&gt;`
#### Description
A middleware struct that wraps an inner service and ensures that the Content-Type header is set to "application/json" if it's not already present.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| service | Rc&lt;S&gt; | The inner service wrapped by this middleware |

#### Internal Logic
The `call` method of this middleware checks if the Content-Type header is present in the request. If not, it adds the header with the value "application/json". Then it forwards the request to the inner service.

### `JsonMiddlewareFactory`
#### Description
A factory struct for creating instances of `JsonMiddleware`.

#### Internal Logic
The `new_transform` method creates a new `JsonMiddleware` instance, wrapping the provided service in an `Rc`.

## Performance Considerations
The use of `Rc` (Reference Counting) for the inner service allows for efficient cloning of the service reference without deep copying. This is important for performance in a concurrent environment.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| actix_http | For HTTP-related types and constants |
| actix_web | For web service and middleware traits |
| futures_util | For future-related utilities |
| std::rc::Rc | For reference-counted smart pointers |

## Error Handling
The middleware propagates any errors from the inner service. It doesn't introduce any additional error handling of its own.

___

This middleware is designed to work within the Actix Web framework, ensuring that JSON is the default content type for requests that don't specify one. This can be particularly useful in API services where most or all endpoints expect JSON data.
