Here's a documentation for the target file `server/src/bin/queue-bm25-migration.rs`:

## High-level description
This script is responsible for migrating vector collections in Qdrant to include BM25 scoring. It iterates through predefined vector sizes, creates corresponding collection names, and queues migration tasks for each collection to Redis.

## Code Structure
The main function sets up the environment, establishes connections to Redis, and then iterates through vector collections to queue migration tasks.

## Symbols

### `main`
#### Description
The entry point of the script. It sets up the environment, initializes connections, and orchestrates the migration process.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up environment variables and logging.
2. Establishes connections to Redis.
3. Defines vector sizes and corresponding collection names.
4. Iterates through collections:
   - Scrolls through Qdrant collection IDs.
   - Queues migration messages to Redis for each batch of point IDs.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| tracing_subscriber | For logging and tracing |
| trieve_server | Core server functionality |
| tokio | Asynchronous runtime |
| dotenvy | Environment variable management |
| bb8_redis | Redis connection pooling |
| serde_json | JSON serialization/deserialization |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| REDIS_URL | String | N/A | URL for Redis connection |
| REDIS_CONNECTIONS | u32 | 2 | Number of Redis connections |
| VECTOR_SIZES | Vec&lt;u64&gt; | [384,512,768,1024,1536,3072] | Vector sizes for collections |

## Error Handling
The script uses the `ServiceError` type for error handling. Errors are logged and propagated up the call stack.

## Logging
Logging is set up using `tracing_subscriber` with INFO level directives.

## TODOs
- None explicitly mentioned in the code.

This script is crucial for updating the vector collections in Qdrant to include BM25 scoring, which can improve search relevance. It's designed to work asynchronously, queueing tasks to Redis for processing, which allows for efficient handling of large-scale migrations.
