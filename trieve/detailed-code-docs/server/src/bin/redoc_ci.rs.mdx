## High-level description
This code defines a command-line executable that generates a JSON representation of the application's API documentation using the `utoipa` and `trieve_server` crates. The generated JSON is then printed to the standard output.

## References
- `trieve_server::ApiDoc`: This symbol refers to a struct or module named `ApiDoc` within the `trieve_server` crate, which is responsible for generating the API documentation.
- `utoipa::OpenApi`: This symbol refers to a trait or struct named `OpenApi` within the `utoipa` crate, which is likely used for defining and serializing the OpenAPI specification.

## Symbols
### `main`
#### Description
This function is the entry point of the executable. It retrieves the API documentation as a JSON string and prints it to the standard output.

#### Inputs
This function takes no inputs.

#### Outputs
This function returns a `std::io::Result&lt;()&gt;`, indicating success or an error during the output process.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Generate API documentation:** It calls `ApiDoc::openapi()` to obtain an OpenAPI object representing the API documentation.
2. **Serialize to JSON:** The `to_pretty_json()` method is called on the OpenAPI object to serialize it into a pretty-printed JSON string.
3. **Print to stdout:** The generated JSON string is printed to the standard output using `println!()`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `trieve_server` | Provides the `ApiDoc` struct/module for generating API documentation. |
| `utoipa` | Offers tools for defining and serializing OpenAPI specifications, likely used for generating the JSON output. |
