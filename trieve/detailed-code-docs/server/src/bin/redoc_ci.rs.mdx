## High-level description
This code generates and prints the OpenAPI documentation for the Trieve server API in JSON format. It utilizes the `utoipa` crate to create the OpenAPI specification from the `ApiDoc` struct defined in the `trieve_server` module.

## Symbols

### `main`
#### Description
The `main` function is the entry point of the program. It generates the OpenAPI documentation and prints it to the standard output in a pretty-printed JSON format.

#### Inputs
This function takes no inputs.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Result | `std::io::Result&lt;()&gt;` | An empty `Ok` result if the operation succeeds, or an `Err` if an I/O error occurs |

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls `ApiDoc::openapi()` to generate the OpenAPI specification.
2. Converts the OpenAPI specification to a pretty-printed JSON string using `to_pretty_json()`.
3. Prints the JSON string to the standard output.
4. Returns `Ok(())` to indicate successful execution.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| trieve_server | Provides the `ApiDoc` struct for generating OpenAPI documentation |
| utoipa | Offers the `OpenApi` trait for converting the API documentation to OpenAPI format |

## Error Handling
The `main` function returns a `std::io::Result&lt;()&gt;`, which allows for potential I/O errors to be propagated. However, the function itself does not explicitly handle any errors. If `to_pretty_json()` fails, the program will panic due to the use of `unwrap()`.

## Attributes
- `#[allow(clippy::print_stdout)]`: This attribute suppresses the Clippy lint warning for using `println!` in the `main` function, indicating that printing to stdout is intentional in this context.

## Performance Considerations
Generating and pretty-printing the OpenAPI documentation may be a relatively expensive operation, especially for large APIs. However, as this is likely a development or CI tool, performance is not a critical concern.

## Notes
1. This code is likely part of a Continuous Integration (CI) process or a development tool, as suggested by the filename `redoc_ci.rs`.
2. The generated OpenAPI documentation can be used with tools like ReDoc to create interactive API documentation for the Trieve server.
3. The use of `unwrap()` on `to_pretty_json()` assumes that the conversion to JSON will always succeed. In a more robust implementation, this potential failure point might be handled more gracefully.
