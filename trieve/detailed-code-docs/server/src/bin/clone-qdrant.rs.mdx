## High-level description
This code implements a utility for cloning data from one Qdrant collection to another. It connects to two Qdrant instances (origin and new), retrieves points from the origin collection, and upserts them into the new collection.

## Code Structure
The main function orchestrates the cloning process, using environment variables for configuration. It iteratively fetches points from the origin collection and inserts them into the new collection.

## Symbols

### `main`
#### Description
The entry point of the script. It sets up the environment, establishes connections to Qdrant instances, and performs the cloning process.

#### Inputs
None (uses environment variables)

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Result | Result&lt;(), ServiceError&gt; | Ok if successful, ServiceError if an error occurs |

#### Internal Logic
1. Loads environment variables
2. Establishes connections to origin and new Qdrant instances
3. Iteratively fetches points from the origin collection
4. Transforms the retrieved points into a format suitable for insertion
5. Upserts the transformed points into the new collection
6. Continues until all points are processed

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| qdrant_client | Interacting with Qdrant databases |
| trieve_server | Custom server functionality and error handling |
| tokio | Asynchronous runtime |
| dotenvy | Loading environment variables |
| uuid | Handling UUIDs |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| ORIGIN_QDRANT_URL | String | N/A | URL of the origin Qdrant instance |
| NEW_QDRANT_URL | String | N/A | URL of the new Qdrant instance |
| QDRANT_API_KEY | String | N/A | API key for Qdrant authentication |
| COLLECTION_TO_CLONE | String | N/A | Name of the collection to clone |

## Error Handling
The code uses the `ServiceError` enum for error handling, which is likely defined in the `trieve_server` crate. Errors are propagated up the call stack and returned as part of the `Result` type.

## Logging
The code uses the `log` crate for error logging, particularly when inserting chunks to Qdrant fails.

## TODOs
None present in the code.
