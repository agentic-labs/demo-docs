## High-level description
This code defines the main function for a Rust web server using the Actix framework. It sets up database connections, configures middleware, and defines the API routes for a service called Trieve. The server handles various operations related to authentication, data management, and search functionality.

## Code Structure
The main function initializes the server configuration, including database connections, Redis session store, and various middleware. It then defines the API routes and their corresponding handler functions. The code also includes OpenAPI documentation for the API endpoints.

## Symbols

### `main`
#### Description
The main function that sets up and runs the Actix web server.

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes environment variables and logging.
2. Sets up database connections (PostgreSQL and Redis).
3. Runs database migrations.
4. Configures server settings, including CORS, session management, and logging.
5. Sets up API routes and their corresponding handlers.
6. Starts the HTTP server.

### `ApiDoc`
#### Description
A struct that generates OpenAPI documentation for the API endpoints.

### `SecurityAddon`
#### Description
A struct that modifies the OpenAPI documentation to include security schemes.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| actix_web | Web framework for building the server |
| diesel | ORM for database operations |
| utoipa | Generates OpenAPI documentation |
| sentry | Error tracking and monitoring |
| redis | Session storage |
| clickhouse | Analytics database |

## Configuration
The server uses various environment variables for configuration:
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| DATABASE_URL | String | Required | PostgreSQL database URL |
| REDIS_URL | String | Required | Redis URL for session storage |
| SENTRY_URL | String | Optional | Sentry URL for error tracking |
| QUANTIZE_VECTORS | bool | false | Whether to quantize vectors in Qdrant |
| REPLICATION_FACTOR | u32 | 2 | Replication factor for Qdrant collections |
| VECTOR_SIZES | Vec&lt;u64&gt; | [384,512,768,1024,1536,3072] | Vector sizes for Qdrant collections |

## Error Handling
The server uses custom error handlers for JSON parsing errors and path errors. It also integrates with Sentry for error tracking if configured.

## Logging
The server uses the `tracing` crate for logging, with different configurations based on whether Sentry is enabled or not.

## API/Interface Reference
The server exposes numerous API endpoints, which are documented using OpenAPI specifications. The main categories include:
- Authentication
- User management
- Organization management
- Dataset operations
- Chunk operations (search, recommendations, etc.)
- File operations
- Analytics

The full API documentation is available through the `/redoc` and `/swagger-ui/` endpoints when the server is running.
