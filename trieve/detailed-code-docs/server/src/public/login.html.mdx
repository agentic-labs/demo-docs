## High-level description
This HTML file implements a simple login page for authenticating a CLI (Command Line Interface) application. It performs a POST request to generate an API key and then redirects to a local URL with the obtained API key as a parameter.

## Code Structure
The file consists of a basic HTML structure with an embedded JavaScript that handles the authentication process.

## Symbols

### Embedded JavaScript
#### Description
This script is responsible for extracting a host parameter from the URL, making a POST request to generate an API key, and then redirecting to a local URL with the obtained API key.

#### Internal Logic
1. Extract the 'host' parameter from the URL using URLSearchParams.
2. Make a POST request to `${host}/api/user/api_key` to generate an API key.
3. On successful response, redirect to `http://localhost:65535` with the API key as a query parameter.

#### Side Effects
- Redirects the browser to a new URL upon successful API key generation.
- Logs errors to the console if the API request fails.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Fetch API | Used to make the HTTP POST request for generating the API key |

## Error Handling
The script uses a simple `catch` block to log any errors that occur during the fetch operation to the console.

## API/Interface Reference
| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| /api/user/api_key | POST | JSON body: `{ name: "Trieve CLI", role: 1 }` | JSON containing `api_key` | Generates an API key for the CLI |

Note: The API endpoint is dynamically constructed using the 'host' parameter from the URL.

This HTML file serves as a bridge between a web-based authentication flow and a CLI application. It automates the process of obtaining an API key and passing it back to the local CLI application, likely running on port 65535.
