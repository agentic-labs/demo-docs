## High-level description
This HTML file provides a login mechanism for a command-line interface (CLI) by authenticating with a backend server and obtaining an API key. It then redirects the user to a local web server running on port 65535, passing the obtained API key as a query parameter.

## References
- This code references a backend API endpoint `/api/user/api_key` hosted on a server specified by the `host` query parameter.

## Symbols
### `login.html`
#### Description
This HTML file handles the authentication process for a CLI by sending a request to the backend server to generate an API key. It then redirects the user to a local web server with the API key.

#### Inputs
- **host** (query parameter): The base URL of the backend server.

#### Outputs
- Redirects the user to `http://localhost:65535` with the obtained API key as a query parameter.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Extract Host:** Retrieves the `host` value from the URL query parameters.
2. **API Request:** Sends a POST request to the `/api/user/api_key` endpoint on the specified host.
    - The request body includes the name "Trieve CLI" and a role ID of 1.
    - Credentials are included in the request.
3. **Handle Response:**
    - If successful, parses the JSON response to obtain the `api_key`.
    - Redirects the user to `http://localhost:65535`, appending the `api_key` as a query parameter.
    - If an error occurs, logs the error to the console.

## Side Effects
- This code makes a network request to the backend server to authenticate and obtain an API key.
- It redirects the browser window to a local web server running on port 65535.

## Error Handling
- Basic error handling is implemented by catching errors during the fetch request and logging them to the console.

## API/Interface Reference
This code interacts with the following backend API endpoint:

| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| /api/user/api_key | POST | `{ "name": "Trieve CLI", "role": 1 }` | `{ "api_key": "your_api_key" }` | Generates an API key for the CLI. |
