## High-level description
This file, `server/src/handlers/mod.rs`, serves as a module declaration file for the handlers in the server application. It exports various handler modules that likely correspond to different API endpoints or functionalities of the server.

## Symbols

### Modules
The file declares and makes public several modules:

- `analytics_handler`: Likely handles analytics-related endpoints.
- `auth_handler`: Probably manages authentication-related endpoints.
- `chunk_handler`: Likely deals with chunk-related operations.
- `dataset_handler`: Probably handles dataset-related endpoints.
- `event_handler`: Likely manages event-related functionalities.
- `file_handler`: Probably handles file-related operations.
- `group_handler`: Likely deals with group-related endpoints.
- `invitation_handler`: Probably manages invitation-related functionalities.
- `message_handler`: Likely handles message-related operations.
- `metrics_handler`: Probably deals with metrics-related endpoints.
- `organization_handler`: Likely manages organization-related functionalities.
- `stripe_handler`: Probably handles Stripe integration for payments.
- `topic_handler`: Likely deals with topic-related operations.
- `user_handler`: Probably manages user-related endpoints.

Each of these modules is declared using the `pub mod` keyword, making them accessible to other parts of the application that import this `handlers` module.

## Dependencies
This file doesn't directly use any external crates or standard library modules. Its main purpose is to organize and expose the various handler modules used in the server application.

___

This module structure suggests a well-organized API with separate handlers for different aspects of the application, such as authentication, data management, analytics, and payment processing. The handlers are likely implemented in their respective files (e.g., `auth_handler.rs`, `chunk_handler.rs`, etc.) within the same directory.
