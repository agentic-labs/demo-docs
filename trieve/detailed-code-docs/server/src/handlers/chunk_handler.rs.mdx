title: "chunk_handler.rs"
---

Here's a high-level description of the `chunk_handler.rs` file:

The `chunk_handler.rs` file is a crucial component of the Trieve server, responsible for handling various operations related to chunks of data. It defines structures and functions for creating, updating, deleting, searching, and managing chunks within datasets. The file implements RESTful API endpoints for chunk-related operations, including semantic search, full-text search, and hybrid search capabilities.

## Code Structure

The file is organized into several main sections:

1. Imports and use statements
2. Struct definitions for request and response payloads
3. API endpoint handler functions
4. Helper functions for chunk operations

The main symbols in the code relate to each other as follows:

- `ChunkReqPayload`: Defines the structure for creating or updating chunks
- `SearchChunksReqPayload`: Specifies parameters for searching chunks
- `ScoreChunkDTO`: Represents a chunk with its search score
- Various handler functions (e.g., `create_chunk`, `search_chunks`, `get_chunk_by_id`) implement the API endpoints
- Helper functions (e.g., `parse_query`, `get_qdrant_vector`) support the main handler functions

## References

The code references other parts of the codebase, including:

- `data::models`: For various data structures and types
- `errors::ServiceError`: For error handling
- `operators::*`: For database and search operations
- `middleware::api_version::APIVersion`: For API versioning

## Symbols

Here are some of the significant symbols in the code:

### `create_chunk`

#### Description
Handles the creation of new chunks or upserts existing ones.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| create_chunk_data | web::Json&lt;CreateChunkReqPayloadEnum&gt; | The chunk data to be created or upserted |
| pool | web::Data&lt;Pool&gt; | Database connection pool |
| _user | AdminOnly | Authenticated admin user |
| dataset_org_plan_sub | DatasetAndOrgWithSubAndPlan | Dataset and organization information |
| redis_pool | web::Data&lt;RedisPool&gt; | Redis connection pool |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
| ReturnQueuedChunk | HttpResponse | Response containing the created or upserted chunk information |

#### Internal Logic
1. Validates the request payload
2. Checks if the chunk limit has been reached for the organization
3. Processes the chunk data (single or batch)
4. Inserts the chunk metadata into the database
5. Queues the chunk for ingestion processing
6. Returns the created or upserted chunk information

### `search_chunks`

#### Description
Performs a search operation on chunks based on the provided query and parameters.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
| data | web::Json&lt;SearchChunksReqPayload&gt; | Search parameters and query |
| _user | LoggedUser | Authenticated user |
| pool | web::Data&lt;Pool&gt; | Database connection pool |
| event_queue | web::Data&lt;EventQueue&gt; | Event queue for logging |
| api_version | APIVersion | API version information |
| dataset_org_plan_sub | DatasetAndOrgWithSubAndPlan | Dataset and organization information |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
| SearchResponseTypes | HttpResponse | Search results containing matching chunks |

#### Internal Logic
1. Parses and processes the search query
2. Performs the search operation based on the specified search type (semantic, full-text, or hybrid)
3. Retrieves and formats the search results
4. Logs the search event
5. Returns the search results

## Side Effects
- Creates or updates chunks in the database
- Queues chunk ingestion tasks
- Logs search and analytics events

## Dependencies
- actix-web
- serde
- uuid
- chrono
- openai_dive
- qdrant_client
- redis

This file is central to the chunk management and search functionality of the Trieve server, implementing core features for handling and retrieving data chunks.
