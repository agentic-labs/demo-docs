## High-level description
This code defines handlers for managing invitations in a server application. It includes functionality for creating, sending, and managing invitations for users to join organizations. The handlers interact with a database and use email services to send invitation emails.

## Code Structure
The main symbols in this code are handler functions that process different invitation-related operations. These functions use various operator functions from other modules to interact with the database and perform specific tasks. The handlers are designed to be used as endpoints in a web server, likely using the Actix web framework.

## Symbols

### `email_regex()`
#### Description
A function that returns a compiled regular expression for validating email addresses.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| regex | regex::Regex | A compiled regular expression for email validation |

### `InvitationResponse`
#### Description
A struct representing the response for an invitation, containing a registration URL.

### `InvitationData`
#### Description
A struct representing the data required to create an invitation, including organization details and user information.

### `post_invitation`
#### Description
Handles the creation and sending of an invitation to a user.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| invitation_data | web::Json&lt;InvitationData&gt; | The invitation data from the request |
| pool | web::Data&lt;Pool&gt; | Database connection pool |
| redis_pool | web::Data&lt;RedisPool&gt; | Redis connection pool |
| user | AdminOnly | The authenticated admin user |

#### Internal Logic
1. Validates the email address
2. Checks if the user is not inviting themselves
3. Verifies the user's role in the organization
4. Attempts to add an existing user to the organization

6. Sends the invitation email

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| app_url | String | The application URL |
| email | String | The invitee's email |
| organization_id | uuid::Uuid | The organization ID |
| redirect_uri | String | The redirect URI after registration |
| user_role | i32 | The role of the invited user |
| pool | web::Data&lt;Pool&gt; | Database connection pool |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| invitation | Result&lt;InvitationWithUrl, ServiceError&gt; | The created invitation with a registration URL |

### `get_invitations`
#### Description
Retrieves all invitations for a specific organization.

|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Result&lt;HttpResponse, ServiceError&gt; | Confirmation of deletion or an error |

## Error Handling
The code uses a `ServiceError` enum for error handling, which is likely defined in a separate module. This allows for consistent error responses across the application.

## Dependencies
The code relies on several external crates and internal modules:
- actix_web for web server functionality
- serde for serialization/deserialization
- uuid for handling UUIDs
- utoipa for API documentation
- Various internal modules for database operations and authentication

This code is part of a larger application that manages users, organizations, and invitations. It provides a RESTful API for handling invitation-related operations with proper authentication and authorization checks.
