title: "group_handler.rs"

Here's a high-level description of the `group_handler.rs` file:

The `group_handler.rs` file contains handlers and related functions for managing chunk groups in the Trieve API. It provides functionality for creating, updating, deleting, and searching chunk groups, as well as managing the relationships between chunks and groups. The file implements various API endpoints for group-related operations and integrates with the Qdrant vector database for efficient searching and recommendation of groups.

## Code Structure

The file is organized into several main sections:

1. Imports and use statements
2. Handler functions for various group-related API endpoints
3. Helper functions and structs for group operations
4. Implementation of search and recommendation functionality for groups

The main symbols in the code relate to each other as follows:

- Handler functions (e.g., `create_chunk_group`, `get_chunks_in_group`) implement the API endpoints.
- These handlers use helper functions and structs to perform database operations and interact with Qdrant.
- Search and recommendation functions (e.g., `search_over_groups`, `get_recommended_groups`) utilize the Qdrant integration for vector search capabilities.

## Symbols

Here are some of the key symbols in the code:

### create_chunk_group
#### Description
Creates a new chunk group or groups.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| create_group_data | web::Json&lt;CreateChunkGroupReqPayloadEnum&gt; | JSON payload containing group creation data |
| _user | AdminOnly | Authenticated admin user |
| dataset_org_plan_sub | DatasetAndOrgWithSubAndPlan | Dataset, organization, and subscription information |
| pool | web::Data&lt;Pool&gt; | Database connection pool |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| HttpResponse | Result&lt;HttpResponse, actix_web::Error&gt; | HTTP response with created group(s) or error |

#### Internal Logic
1. Extracts group data from the request payload
2. Validates the number of groups to be created
3. Separates upsert and non-upsert payloads
4. Creates groups in the database
5. Returns the created groups in the response

### search_over_groups
#### Description
Performs a search over groups, returning groups as results instead of individual chunks.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| data | web::Json&lt;SearchOverGroupsReqPayload&gt; | JSON payload containing search parameters |
| pool | web::Data&lt;Pool&gt; | Database connection pool |
| event_queue | web::Data&lt;EventQueue&gt; | Queue for logging events |
| api_version | APIVersion | API version for response formatting |
| _required_user | LoggedUser | Authenticated user |
| dataset_org_plan_sub | DatasetAndOrgWithSubAndPlan | Dataset, organization, and subscription information |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| HttpResponse | Result&lt;HttpResponse, actix_web::Error&gt; | HTTP response with search results or error |

#### Internal Logic
1. Parses and processes the search query
2. Performs the search operation based on the specified search type (fulltext, semantic, or hybrid)
3. Retrieves and formats the search results
4. Logs the search event
5. Returns the search results in the response

## Dependencies
The file relies on several external libraries and internal modules:

- `actix_web` for handling HTTP requests and responses
- `serde` for JSON serialization and deserialization
- `utoipa` for API documentation
- Internal modules for database operations, Qdrant integration, and error handling

## Error Handling
The file uses the `ServiceError` enum for error handling, which is propagated through the `Result` type. Common error scenarios include bad requests, unauthorized access, and internal server errors.

## API Endpoints
The file defines several API endpoints for group-related operations, including:

- Creating groups
- Updating groups
- Deleting groups
- Searching within groups
- Recommending groups
- Adding/removing chunks to/from groups

These endpoints are documented using the `utoipa` crate for OpenAPI specification generation.
