## High-level description
This directory contains Helm chart templates for deploying and configuring Qdrant, a vector database and search engine, on Kubernetes. The templates define various Kubernetes resources such as ConfigMaps, Ingress, PodDisruptionBudget, Secrets, Services, ServiceAccount, ServiceMonitor, and StatefulSet to set up a complete Qdrant deployment.

## What does it do?
These templates work together to create a fully functional Qdrant deployment in a Kubernetes environment. They handle various aspects of the deployment, including:

1. Configuring Qdrant instances with custom settings
2. Setting up network access through Services and Ingress
3. Managing high availability with PodDisruptionBudget
4. Securing API access with Secrets
5. Providing service discovery with headless Services
6. Monitoring the deployment with ServiceMonitor
7. Deploying Qdrant pods using StatefulSet for persistent storage
8. Running integration tests to verify the deployment

The templates allow for customization of various aspects of the deployment through Helm values, making it flexible for different use cases and environments.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this directory is the `statefulset.yaml` file, which defines the core Qdrant deployment. Other important files include:

1. `configmap.yaml`: Defines configuration data for Qdrant pods
2. `service.yaml` and `service-headless.yaml`: Set up network access to Qdrant
3. `ingress.yaml`: Configures external access to the Qdrant service
4. `secret.yaml`: Manages API keys for Qdrant
5. `servicemonitor.yaml`: Sets up monitoring for the Qdrant service

The templates work together to create a complete Qdrant deployment, with the StatefulSet managing the core application and other resources providing supporting functionality.

## Key Files
1. `statefulset.yaml`: Defines the Qdrant StatefulSet, including pod specifications, storage, and scaling options.
2. `configmap.yaml`: Contains configuration data for Qdrant, including initialization scripts and production settings.
3. `service.yaml` and `service-headless.yaml`: Define Kubernetes Services for accessing Qdrant pods.
4. `ingress.yaml`: Configures Ingress for external access to Qdrant.
5. `secret.yaml`: Manages API keys for securing Qdrant access.
6. `servicemonitor.yaml`: Sets up Prometheus monitoring for Qdrant metrics.
7. `pdb.yaml`: Defines a PodDisruptionBudget for maintaining high availability.
8. `tests/test-db-interaction.yaml`: Contains integration tests for verifying Qdrant functionality.

## Dependencies
The templates rely on the following external dependencies:

1. Kubernetes API (various versions, including `apps/v1`, `networking.k8s.io/v1`, `policy/v1`, and `monitoring.coreos.com/v1`)
2. Helm templating engine
3. Qdrant Docker image (specified in the values)
4. Prometheus Operator (for ServiceMonitor functionality)

## Configuration
The templates are highly configurable through Helm values. Key configuration options include:

1. Qdrant image repository and tag
2. Replica count and scaling options
3. Resource requests and limits
4. Persistence storage configuration
5. Service ports and types
6. Ingress settings
7. API key management
8. Monitoring configuration

These options allow users to customize the Qdrant deployment to fit their specific requirements and infrastructure.
