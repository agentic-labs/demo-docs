## High-level description
This directory contains Kubernetes manifest templates for deploying and configuring Qdrant, a vector database, using Helm. The templates define various Kubernetes resources such as ConfigMaps, Ingress, PodDisruptionBudget, Secrets, Services, ServiceMonitor, StatefulSet, and test resources. These templates work together to create a fully functional and configurable Qdrant deployment in a Kubernetes environment.

## What does it do?
The templates in this directory collectively define a Kubernetes deployment for Qdrant with the following features:

1. Deployment of Qdrant instances using a StatefulSet for stable network identities and persistent storage.
2. Configuration management using ConfigMaps for initialization scripts and Qdrant settings.
3. Ingress setup for external access to the Qdrant service.
4. PodDisruptionBudget for maintaining availability during voluntary disruptions.
5. Secure storage of API keys using Kubernetes Secrets.
6. Service definitions for both headless (for direct pod communication) and regular services.
7. Prometheus monitoring configuration using ServiceMonitor.
8. Test resources for verifying the Qdrant deployment's functionality.

These templates allow for flexible configuration of the Qdrant deployment through Helm values, enabling customization of various aspects such as replica count, resource allocation, persistence settings, and monitoring options.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this Helm chart is the StatefulSet definition (`statefulset.yaml`), which defines the core Qdrant deployment. Other key files include:

1. `configmap.yaml`: Defines the configuration and initialization scripts for Qdrant.
2. `service.yaml` and `service-headless.yaml`: Define the services for accessing Qdrant.
3. `ingress.yaml`: Configures external access to the Qdrant service.
4. `secret.yaml`: Manages API keys for Qdrant.
5. `servicemonitor.yaml`: Sets up Prometheus monitoring for Qdrant.

The flow of control typically starts with the StatefulSet, which references the ConfigMap for configuration and the Secret for API keys. The Services expose the StatefulSet pods, while the Ingress (if enabled) provides external access. The ServiceMonitor configures Prometheus to scrape metrics from the Qdrant service.

## Key Files
1. `statefulset.yaml`: Defines the core Qdrant deployment, including container specifications, volume mounts, and persistent storage configuration.
2. `configmap.yaml`: Contains the initialization script and Qdrant configuration, crucial for setting up the Qdrant instances.
3. `service.yaml` and `service-headless.yaml`: Define how the Qdrant pods are exposed within the cluster and potentially externally.
4. `ingress.yaml`: Configures external access to the Qdrant service when enabled.
5. `secret.yaml`: Manages the secure storage of API keys for Qdrant authentication.
6. `servicemonitor.yaml`: Sets up Prometheus monitoring for the Qdrant service.
7. `tests/test-connection.yaml`: Defines a test pod and script to verify the functionality of the Qdrant deployment.

## Dependencies
The templates in this directory rely on the following external dependencies:

1. Kubernetes: The target platform for deploying these resources.
2. Helm: Used for templating and customization of the deployment.
3. Prometheus Operator: Required for the ServiceMonitor resource to function.
4. Qdrant Docker Image: The actual Qdrant application container image (referenced in the StatefulSet).

## Configuration
The templates are highly configurable through Helm values. Key configuration options include:

1. Replica count for Qdrant instances
2. Resource requests and limits
3. Persistence settings for storage
4. Ingress configuration for external access
5. API key settings for authentication
6. Monitoring configuration for Prometheus
7. Service type and port configurations
8. TLS and security settings

These configuration options allow for flexible deployment of Qdrant across different environments and use cases.

In conclusion, this directory contains a comprehensive set of Kubernetes manifest templates for deploying Qdrant using Helm. It provides a flexible and configurable way to set up Qdrant in a Kubernetes environment, with features for scaling, persistence, monitoring, and security.
