## High-level description
This Kubernetes manifest file defines a test pod and a ConfigMap for testing database interactions with Qdrant, a vector database. The test creates a collection, inserts points with vector data, and performs a search query to verify the functionality of the Qdrant instance deployed in the cluster.

## Code Structure
The file contains two main Kubernetes resources:
1. A Pod that runs the test script
2. A ConfigMap that contains the test script

These resources are interconnected, with the Pod mounting the ConfigMap as a volume to access the test script.

## Symbols

### Pod Resource
#### Description
Defines a Kubernetes Pod that runs the test script against the Qdrant database.

#### Internal Logic
- Uses the `registry.suse.com/bci/bci-base:latest` image to run the test script
- Mounts the test script from a ConfigMap
- Allows for additional volume mounts and volumes through `.Values.additionalVolumeMounts` and `.Values.additionalVolumes`
- Sets the restart policy to "Never" to ensure the test runs only once
- Uses a service account named after the Qdrant release

### ConfigMap Resource
#### Description
Defines a ConfigMap containing the test script (`entrypoint.sh`) that interacts with the Qdrant database.

#### Internal Logic
The test script performs the following steps:
1. Sets up curl configuration for retries and timeouts
2. Copies CA certificates if present
3. Determines the Qdrant URL based on the service configuration
4. Sets up API key headers if provided
5. Deletes the test collection if it exists
6. Creates a new collection with specified vector parameters
7. Inserts sample points with vector data and payload
8. Runs a search query on the inserted points

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| curl | Used for making HTTP requests to the Qdrant API |
| bash | Scripting language used for the test script |

## Configuration
The test pod and script use several configuration options from the Helm values:

| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| .Values.additionalVolumeMounts | list | Additional volume mounts for the test pod |
| .Values.additionalVolumes | list | Additional volumes for the test pod |
| .Values.apiKey | string | API key for authenticating with Qdrant |
| .Values.readOnlyApiKey | string | Read-only API key for Qdrant |
| .Values.config.service.enable_tls | boolean | Enables TLS for the Qdrant service |

## Error Handling
The test script uses `set -xe` to exit immediately if any command fails and to print each command before execution. The curl commands use the `--fail-with-body` option to fail on HTTP errors while still displaying the response body.

## API/Interface Reference
The test script interacts with the following Qdrant API endpoints:

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:------------|
| /collections/{collection_name} | DELETE | Deletes the test collection |
| /collections/{collection_name} | PUT | Creates a new collection |
| /collections/{collection_name}/points | PUT | Inserts points into the collection |
| /collections/{collection_name}/points/search | POST | Performs a search query on the collection |
