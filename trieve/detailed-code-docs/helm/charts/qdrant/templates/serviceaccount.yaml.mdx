## High-level description
This YAML file defines a Kubernetes ServiceAccount resource for the Qdrant application. It creates a ServiceAccount with a dynamically generated name, optional annotations, and labels specific to the Qdrant deployment.

### ServiceAccount Resource
#### Description
This YAML defines a Kubernetes ServiceAccount, which is used to provide an identity for processes running in a Pod. It allows for fine-grained control over what the Pod can access within the cluster.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `apiVersion` and `kind` fields specify that this is a ServiceAccount resource.
2. The `metadata` section contains:
   - A `name` field that uses a template function to generate a full name for the ServiceAccount.
   - An optional `annotations` section that adds annotations if specified in the Helm values.
   - A `labels` section that includes labels specific to the Qdrant application.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Helm | This template uses Helm functions and syntax for templating and value injection. |

## Configuration
The following Helm values can be configured:

| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| serviceAccount.annotations | map | Optional annotations to add to the ServiceAccount |

## References
This template references other parts of the Helm chart:

1. `{{ include "qdrant.fullname" . }}`: This likely refers to a template defined elsewhere in the chart that generates a full name for Qdrant resources.
2. `{{ include "qdrant.labels" . }}`: This refers to a template that generates standard labels for Qdrant resources.

These references suggest that there are helper templates defined elsewhere in the Helm chart to maintain consistency in naming and labeling across different Kubernetes resources for the Qdrant application.
