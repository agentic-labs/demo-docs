title: "service-headless.yaml"
---

## High-level description
This YAML file defines a Kubernetes Headless Service for Qdrant, a vector database. It creates a service without a cluster IP, allowing direct communication with individual pods, which is useful for stateful applications like databases.

## Code Structure
The file consists of a single Kubernetes Service resource definition with metadata and spec sections. It uses Helm templating to dynamically generate values based on the chart's configuration.

### Service Definition
#### Description
Defines a Kubernetes Service of type Headless (clusterIP: None) for Qdrant.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the service name using the `qdrant.fullname` template with a "-headless" suffix.
2. Applies labels using the `qdrant.labels` template.
3. Adds additional labels if specified in `.Values.service.additionalLabels`.
4. Configures the service spec:
   - Sets `clusterIP: None` to make it a headless service.
   - Enables `publishNotReadyAddresses` for all pod IPs to be published.
   - Defines ports based on `.Values.service.ports`.
   - Sets selector labels using the `qdrant.selectorLabels` template.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Helm | Used for templating and value injection |

## Configuration
The service configuration is highly dependent on Helm values. Key configurable aspects include:

| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| .Values.service.additionalLabels | map | Additional labels to apply to the service |
| .Values.service.ports | list | Ports to be exposed by the service |

Each port in `.Values.service.ports` should have the following structure:
```yaml
- name: portName
  port: portNumber
  targetPort: targetPortNumber
  protocol: TCP  # Optional, defaults to TCP
```

## Notes
1. This is a headless service, which is typically used for stateful applications to allow direct communication with individual pods.
2. The `publishNotReadyAddresses: true` setting ensures that all pod IPs are published, even if they're not ready, which can be useful for certain database clustering scenarios.
3. The service uses Helm templates (e.g., `{{ include "qdrant.fullname" . }}`) to generate consistent naming and labeling across the Helm chart.
4. The port configuration is flexible, allowing multiple ports to be defined in the Helm values and automatically included in the service.
