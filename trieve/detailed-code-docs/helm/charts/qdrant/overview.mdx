## High-level description
This directory contains the Helm chart for deploying Qdrant, a vector database, on Kubernetes. It includes configuration files, templates, and documentation for setting up and managing a Qdrant instance or cluster using Helm.

## What does it do?
The Qdrant Helm chart automates the deployment and configuration of Qdrant in a Kubernetes environment. It allows users to:

1. Deploy single or multiple Qdrant instances
2. Configure persistence for data storage
3. Set up authentication using API keys
4. Enable external access through Ingress
5. Configure monitoring with Prometheus
6. Customize Qdrant settings through a ConfigMap
7. Manage updates and rollbacks of the Qdrant deployment

The chart handles the creation of necessary Kubernetes resources such as StatefulSets, Services, ConfigMaps, Secrets, and optionally Ingress and ServiceMonitor objects. It provides a streamlined way to deploy and manage Qdrant with various configuration options to suit different use cases and environments.

## Key Files
1. `Chart.yaml`: Defines metadata for the Helm chart, including version information and dependencies.
2. `values.yaml`: Contains default configuration values for the Qdrant deployment, which can be overridden during installation or upgrade.
3. `templates/`: Directory containing Kubernetes manifest templates for various resources:
   - `statefulset.yaml`: Defines the core Qdrant deployment
   - `configmap.yaml`: Manages Qdrant configuration and initialization scripts
   - `service.yaml` and `service-headless.yaml`: Define services for accessing Qdrant
   - `ingress.yaml`: Configures external access (when enabled)
   - `secret.yaml`: Manages API keys for authentication
   - `servicemonitor.yaml`: Sets up Prometheus monitoring
4. `README.md`: Provides documentation on how to install, configure, and use the Helm chart.
5. `CHANGELOG.md`: Lists changes and updates to the chart across versions.

## Dependencies
The Qdrant Helm chart has the following dependencies:

1. Kubernetes (v1.24+): The target platform for deployment
2. Helm: Used for packaging and deploying the chart
3. Qdrant Docker Image: The actual Qdrant application container (referenced in `values.yaml`)
4. Prometheus Operator (optional): Required if using the ServiceMonitor for monitoring

## Configuration
The chart is highly configurable through the `values.yaml` file. Key configuration options include:

1. `replicaCount`: Number of Qdrant replicas (default: 4)
2. `image`: Container image settings (repository, tag, pull policy)
3. `persistence`: Storage configuration for Qdrant data
4. `service`: Service type and port configurations
5. `ingress`: Settings for external access (disabled by default)
6. `apiKey`: API key configuration for authentication
7. `config`: Allows overriding default Qdrant configuration
8. `podManagementPolicy`: Controls how pods are created and terminated

Users can customize these values during installation or upgrade to tailor the Qdrant deployment to their specific needs. For example, to enable a distributed setup, users would increase the `replicaCount` and set `config.cluster.enabled` to true.

The chart also supports advanced features such as snapshot restoration for single-node setups and metrics exposure for monitoring.

In conclusion, this Helm chart provides a comprehensive and flexible solution for deploying and managing Qdrant on Kubernetes, catering to both simple single-instance deployments and more complex distributed setups with various configuration options.
