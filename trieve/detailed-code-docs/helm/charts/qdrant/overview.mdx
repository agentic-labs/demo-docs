## High-level description
This directory contains the Helm chart for deploying Qdrant, a vector database and search engine, on Kubernetes. The chart includes templates for various Kubernetes resources, configuration files, and values for customizing the deployment. It provides a comprehensive solution for setting up a Qdrant instance or cluster with features like persistence, monitoring, and security.

## What does it do?
The Qdrant Helm chart automates the deployment and configuration of Qdrant in a Kubernetes environment. It sets up the following:

1. Deploys Qdrant pods using a StatefulSet for data persistence and scaling.
2. Configures networking with Services and optional Ingress for external access.
3. Sets up persistent storage for Qdrant data.
4. Implements security measures like API key management and pod security contexts.
5. Enables monitoring through Prometheus ServiceMonitor.
6. Provides options for high availability with PodDisruptionBudget.
7. Allows for custom configuration of Qdrant instances.
8. Supports snapshot restoration for data recovery.
9. Includes integration tests to verify the deployment.

The chart is highly customizable through the `values.yaml` file, allowing users to tailor the deployment to their specific needs and infrastructure requirements.

## Entry points
The main entry points for this Helm chart are:

1. `Chart.yaml`: Defines the chart metadata, version, and dependencies.
2. `values.yaml`: Contains the default configuration values for the chart.
3. `templates/statefulset.yaml`: The core template for deploying Qdrant pods.

The deployment process typically starts with customizing the `values.yaml` file and then using the Helm CLI to install or upgrade the chart.

## Key Files
1. `templates/statefulset.yaml`: Defines the Qdrant StatefulSet, including pod specifications, storage, and scaling options.
2. `templates/configmap.yaml`: Contains configuration data for Qdrant, including initialization scripts and settings.
3. `templates/service.yaml` and `templates/service-headless.yaml`: Define Kubernetes Services for accessing Qdrant pods.
4. `templates/ingress.yaml`: Configures Ingress for external access to Qdrant.
5. `templates/secret.yaml`: Manages API keys for securing Qdrant access.
6. `templates/servicemonitor.yaml`: Sets up Prometheus monitoring for Qdrant metrics.
7. `templates/pdb.yaml`: Defines a PodDisruptionBudget for maintaining high availability.
8. `templates/tests/test-db-interaction.yaml`: Contains integration tests for verifying Qdrant functionality.

## Dependencies
The chart relies on the following external dependencies:

1. Kubernetes API (v1.24+)
2. Helm (v3+)
3. Qdrant Docker image (v1.8.4 by default)
4. Prometheus Operator (optional, for ServiceMonitor functionality)
5. PV provisioner (provided by the infrastructure)

## Configuration
The chart is highly configurable through the `values.yaml` file. Key configuration options include:

1. `replicaCount`: Number of Qdrant replicas to deploy.
2. `image`: Qdrant container image settings.
3. `service`: Network service configuration.
4. `ingress`: External access configuration.
5. `persistence`: Storage settings for Qdrant data.
6. `resources`: CPU and memory allocation for Qdrant pods.
7. `config`: Custom Qdrant configuration options.
8. `snapshotRestoration`: Settings for restoring from snapshots.
9. `metrics`: Prometheus monitoring configuration.
10. `apiKey` and `readOnlyApiKey`: API key management for security.

Users can customize these values to adapt the Qdrant deployment to their specific requirements, such as scaling, networking, storage, and security needs.

The chart also includes a `CHANGELOG.md` file that documents changes between versions, helping users understand updates and new features as they evolve.
