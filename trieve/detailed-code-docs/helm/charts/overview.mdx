## High-level description
This directory contains Helm charts for deploying and managing three key database systems on Kubernetes: PostgreSQL, Qdrant (a vector database), and Redis. Each chart provides comprehensive configuration options and templates for deploying these databases in various architectures, from standalone instances to distributed clusters, with features for high availability, security, monitoring, and scalability.

## What does it do?
The Helm charts in this directory automate the deployment and management of database systems on Kubernetes, offering the following functionalities:

1. PostgreSQL:
   - Deploy primary and read replica instances
   - Set up automated backups
   - Configure network policies and RBAC
   - Enable monitoring with Prometheus
   - Manage secrets and TLS certificates

2. Qdrant:
   - Deploy single or multiple Qdrant instances
   - Configure persistence for data storage
   - Set up authentication using API keys
   - Enable external access through Ingress
   - Configure monitoring with Prometheus

3. Redis:
   - Deploy standalone, replication, or sentinel architectures
   - Configure persistent storage and authentication
   - Set up monitoring and metrics collection
   - Manage network policies and RBAC
   - Support horizontal scaling of replica nodes

These charts simplify the process of deploying complex database systems on Kubernetes, allowing users to customize various aspects such as resource allocation, security settings, and high availability configurations through a single `values.yaml` file for each chart.

## Key Files
Each chart directory contains similar key files:

1. `Chart.yaml`: Defines metadata, version, and dependencies for the chart.
2. `values.yaml`: Contains default configuration values for the deployment.
3. `values.schema.json`: Provides validation rules for the configuration values.
4. `templates/`: Directory containing Kubernetes resource templates.
5. `README.md`: Offers comprehensive documentation on usage and configuration.

Additionally:
- PostgreSQL and Redis charts include a `charts/` directory with the Bitnami Common Library Chart as a dependency.
- Each chart has specific template files for their unique resources, such as StatefulSets, Services, and ConfigMaps.

## Dependencies
Common dependencies across the charts include:

1. Kubernetes: Generally designed for version 1.23+
2. Helm: Uses Helm v3 for templating and deployment management
3. Bitnami container images: Used for the respective database systems
4. Prometheus Operator (optional): For ServiceMonitor and metrics collection

Specific versions and additional dependencies are detailed in each chart's documentation.

## Configuration
Each chart offers extensive configuration options through its `values.yaml` file, including:

1. Database version and settings
2. Resource allocation and scaling
3. Persistence and storage configurations
4. Security settings (RBAC, NetworkPolicy, TLS, authentication)
5. Monitoring and metrics options
6. High availability and replication configurations
7. Custom initialization scripts and configurations

Users can customize these settings by modifying the `values.yaml` file or passing values during Helm installation or upgrade. The `values.schema.json` file in each chart provides validation rules for the configuration options, ensuring that users provide valid inputs.

The flexibility in configuration allows these charts to be used in various environments, from development to production, with appropriate settings for each scenario. They provide a streamlined way to deploy and manage complex database systems on Kubernetes while offering fine-grained control over the deployment architecture and features.
