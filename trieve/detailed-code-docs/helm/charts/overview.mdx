## High-level description
This directory contains Helm charts for deploying various database and search engine solutions on Kubernetes. The charts include PostgreSQL, Qdrant (a vector database), and Redis. These charts provide comprehensive deployment configurations for setting up production-ready instances of these databases with features like persistence, monitoring, security, and high availability.

## What does it do?
The Helm charts in this directory automate the deployment and configuration of database systems in a Kubernetes environment. They handle the following key aspects:

1. Deployment of database pods using StatefulSets for data persistence and scaling.
2. Configuration of networking with Services and optional Ingress for external access.
3. Setup of persistent storage for data.
4. Implementation of security measures like API key management, RBAC, and pod security contexts.
5. Enabling monitoring through Prometheus integration.
6. Configuration of high availability features like replication and failover.
7. Customization options for fine-tuning database instances.
8. Support for backup and restore operations.
9. Integration tests to verify deployments.

Each chart is highly customizable through its respective `values.yaml` file, allowing users to tailor the deployment to their specific needs and infrastructure requirements.

## Entry points
The main entry points for each chart are:

1. `Chart.yaml`: Defines the chart metadata, version, and dependencies.
2. `values.yaml`: Contains the default configuration values for the chart.
3. `templates/` directory: Contains the Kubernetes resource templates.

The deployment process typically starts with customizing the `values.yaml` file and then using the Helm CLI to install or upgrade the chart.

## Key Files
1. `postgresql/values.yaml`: Configuration for PostgreSQL deployment, including primary and replica settings, backups, metrics, and security options.
2. `qdrant/templates/statefulset.yaml`: Defines the Qdrant StatefulSet for deploying vector database pods.
3. `redis/values.yaml`: Comprehensive configuration for Redis deployment, including master, replica, and sentinel settings.

## Dependencies
The charts rely on the following external dependencies:

1. Kubernetes API (typically v1.24+)
2. Helm (v3+)
3. Respective database Docker images (PostgreSQL, Qdrant, Redis)
4. Prometheus Operator (optional, for ServiceMonitor functionality)
5. PV provisioner (provided by the infrastructure)

## Configuration
Each chart is highly configurable through its `values.yaml` file. Key configuration options include:

1. Replica count and scaling options
2. Container image settings
3. Networking and service configuration
4. Persistence and storage settings
5. Resource allocation (CPU and memory)
6. Security settings (API keys, RBAC, etc.)
7. Monitoring and metrics configuration
8. Backup and restore options
9. High availability and failover settings

Users can customize these values to adapt the database deployments to their specific requirements, such as scaling, networking, storage, and security needs.

The charts also include documentation files like `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` that provide usage instructions and version history, helping users understand updates and new features as they evolve.
