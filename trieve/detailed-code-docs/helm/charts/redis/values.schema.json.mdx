## High-level description
This JSON schema file defines the configuration options for a Redis Helm chart. It specifies the structure and validation rules for various Redis deployment settings, including architecture, authentication, persistence, metrics, and more.

## Symbols

### `properties`
#### Description
The root object containing all the configurable properties for the Redis Helm chart.

#### Internal Logic
- Defines the structure and validation rules for various configuration options.
- Uses nested objects to group related settings.
- Implements conditional visibility for certain fields based on other field values.

### `architecture`
#### Description
Specifies the Redis architecture type.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| architecture | string | Redis architecture type |

#### Internal Logic
- Allows values: "standalone" or "replication"
- Displayed as a form field

### `auth`
#### Description
Configures authentication settings for Redis.

#### Internal Logic
- Contains nested properties for enabling password authentication and setting the password.
- Implements conditional visibility for the password field based on the `enabled` property.

### `master`
#### Description
Configures settings for the Redis master node.

#### Internal Logic
- Defines properties for workload kind, persistence, and volume size.
- Implements conditional visibility for the volume size based on persistence being enabled.

### `replica`
#### Description
Configures settings for Redis replica nodes.

#### Internal Logic
- Similar structure to the `master` object, but with additional properties for replica count.
- Entire object is conditionally visible based on the `architecture` property.

### `volumePermissions`
#### Description
Configures volume permission settings.

### `metrics`
#### Description
Configures Prometheus metrics settings for Redis.

#### Internal Logic
- Contains properties for enabling metrics exporter and ServiceMonitor creation.
- Implements conditional visibility for ServiceMonitor settings based on metrics being enabled.

## Dependencies
This schema file doesn't directly depend on external libraries, but it is used in conjunction with the Helm chart for Redis deployment.

## Configuration
The schema defines various configuration options, including:
- Redis architecture (standalone or replication)
- Authentication settings
- Master and replica node configurations
- Persistence settings
- Metrics and monitoring options

## Error Handling
The schema provides validation rules for various fields, which can help prevent configuration errors during deployment.

## API/Interface Reference
This schema file defines the structure and validation rules for the Redis Helm chart's `values.yaml` file. It is used by Helm and potentially other tools to validate and provide a user interface for configuring Redis deployments.
