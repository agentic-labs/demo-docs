## High-level description
This YAML file defines configuration values for a Helm chart named "common" which is nested under `redis/charts/common`. This chart seems to be part of a larger deployment related to Redis, potentially managed by VMware. The specific purpose of this "common" chart is not clear from the provided context.

## Symbols

### `exampleValue`
#### Description
This value seems to be a placeholder used for demonstration or testing purposes. It holds the string "common-chart", potentially indicating that this chart is intended to be used as a common base for other charts.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
String: "common-chart"

#### Internal Logic
This symbol simply defines a key-value pair where the key is "exampleValue" and the value is the string "common-chart". 

## Configuration
This file defines a single configuration option:

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| exampleValue | string | "common-chart" | A placeholder value likely used for demonstration or testing. |
