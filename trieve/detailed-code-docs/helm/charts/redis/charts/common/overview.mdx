## High-level description
This directory contains the common library chart provided by Bitnami for use across various Bitnami charts. It serves as a shared resource, offering reusable logic and helper functions to streamline chart development and maintain consistency across different Bitnami Helm charts.

## What does it do?
The common library chart provides a set of template helpers and shared functionality that can be used in other Helm charts. It simplifies chart development by offering pre-defined functions for common tasks such as naming conventions, secret management, and value validation. This allows chart developers to focus on application-specific logic while leveraging standardized implementations for common chart elements.

## Key Files

1. Chart.yaml
   - Defines the metadata for the common library chart, including its name, version, and type.
   - Specifies that this is a library chart (type: library) and is not deployable on its own.
   - Provides information about the maintainers (VMware, Inc.) and the chart's home page.

2. README.md
   - Offers comprehensive documentation on how to use the common library chart.
   - Provides examples of how to include the chart as a dependency in other charts.
   - Explains special input schemas for common chart elements like ImageRoot, Persistence, and ExistingSecret.
   - Includes information on chart versioning and upgrading.

3. values.yaml
   - Contains a minimal set of default values for the chart.
   - Includes an `exampleValue` field, primarily used for CI/CD processes.

## Dependencies
The common library chart itself does not have external dependencies. However, it is designed to be used as a dependency in other Bitnami charts. To use this chart, other charts would include it as a dependency in their `Chart.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  - name: common
    version: 2.x.x
    repository: oci://registry-1.docker.io/bitnamicharts
```

## Configuration
The common library chart provides several reusable configuration schemas:

1. ImageRoot: For configuring container images, including registry, repository, tag, and pull policy.
2. Persistence: For setting up persistent storage, including storage class, access mode, and size.
3. ExistingSecret: For referencing existing Kubernetes secrets, allowing users to use their own secrets for sensitive data.

These schemas can be used in charts that depend on the common library to ensure consistent configuration across different Bitnami charts.

The `values.yaml` file in this directory is minimal, containing only an `exampleValue` field. This is because the common library chart is not meant to be deployed directly, but rather to provide shared functionality to other charts.

## Additional Notes
1. The chart requires Kubernetes 1.23+ and Helm 3.8.0+.
2. It includes helper functions for value validation, which can be used to ensure required values are provided when deploying charts.
3. The chart is licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.
4. The README provides information on upgrading from version 1.0.0, which marked the end of Helm v2 support and the transition to Helm v3 compatibility.

This common library chart plays a crucial role in the Bitnami chart ecosystem, providing a foundation of shared functionality that enhances consistency and reduces duplication across multiple charts.
