## High-level description
The "common" directory is a Helm library chart that provides shared logic, templates, and functions for use across other Bitnami charts. It's not meant to be deployed independently but serves as a reusable component for other Helm charts.

## What does it do?
This library chart offers a collection of common Helm chart helpers and templates that can be used to streamline the development and maintenance of other Helm charts. It provides standardized ways to handle naming, labels, secrets, validations, and other common chart operations. By centralizing these functions, it promotes consistency across different charts and reduces duplication of code.

## Key Files
1. Chart.yaml: This file defines the metadata for the library chart, including its name, version, description, and type.

2. README.md: Provides documentation on how to use the common library chart, including installation instructions, parameters, and usage examples.

3. values.yaml: Contains default configuration values for the chart. In this case, it only includes an example value, suggesting that most of the functionality is provided through templates and helpers rather than configuration.

## Dependencies
The common chart itself doesn't specify any external dependencies. However, it is designed to be used as a dependency in other Helm charts. To use this library chart, other charts would include it as a dependency in their own Chart.yaml file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  - name: common
    version: 2.x.x
    repository: oci://registry-1.docker.io/bitnamicharts
```

## Configuration
The values.yaml file in this chart is minimal, containing only an example value:

```yaml
exampleValue: "common-chart"
```

This suggests that the chart's functionality is primarily provided through its templates and helpers, rather than through configurable values.

The README provides information on special input schemas that can be used with the helpers provided by this chart:

1. ImageRoot: Used for configuring container images, including registry, repository, tag, and pull policy.
2. Persistence: Used for configuring persistent storage, including storage class, access mode, and size.
3. ExistingSecret: Used for referencing existing Kubernetes secrets.
4. ValidateValue: Used for validating input values and providing user-friendly error messages.

These schemas provide standardized ways to handle common configuration patterns across different Helm charts.

The chart is designed to be flexible and reusable, allowing other charts to leverage its functionality while maintaining their own specific configurations. By using this common library, chart developers can focus on the unique aspects of their applications while relying on standardized implementations for common Helm chart patterns.
