## High-level description
This directory contains Helm chart files for deploying Redis, an open-source, advanced key-value store. The chart supports deploying Redis in standalone, replication, and sentinel architectures with various configuration options for security, persistence, monitoring, and high availability.

## What does it do?
The Redis Helm chart deploys and manages Redis instances on Kubernetes clusters. It provides the following key functionalities:

1. Deploys Redis master and replica nodes
2. Optionally sets up Redis Sentinel for high availability
3. Configures persistent storage for data
4. Manages authentication and TLS encryption
5. Sets up monitoring and metrics collection
6. Configures network policies and RBAC
7. Allows customization of Redis configuration
8. Supports horizontal scaling of replica nodes
9. Provides init containers for volume permissions and system tuning

## Entry points
The main entry points for this chart are:

1. `values.yaml`: The default configuration file where users can customize their Redis deployment.
2. `templates/configmap.yaml`: Defines the core Redis configuration.
3. `templates/master/application.yaml`: Deploys the Redis master node.
4. `templates/replicas/application.yaml`: Deploys Redis replica nodes.
5. `templates/sentinel/statefulset.yaml`: Deploys Redis sentinel nodes (if enabled).

## Key Files
1. `Chart.yaml`: Defines the chart metadata, version, and dependencies.
2. `values.yaml`: Contains the default configuration values for the chart.
3. `values.schema.json`: Provides a JSON schema for validating the values.yaml file.
4. `templates/`: Directory containing Kubernetes resource templates for deploying Redis.
5. `charts/common/`: A subchart providing common utilities and helpers for Bitnami charts.

## Dependencies
The chart has the following main dependencies:

1. Bitnami Redis container images
2. Bitnami Redis Exporter image (for metrics)
3. Kubernetes API (v1.23+)
4. Helm (v3.8.0+)
5. Bitnami Common chart (included as a subchart)

## Configuration
The chart offers extensive configuration options through the `values.yaml` file, including:

1. Redis architecture (standalone, replication, sentinel)
2. Authentication and TLS settings
3. Persistence configuration
4. Resource allocation and scaling
5. Monitoring and metrics collection
6. Network policies
7. Service types and port configurations
8. Custom scripts and configurations

Users can customize these settings by providing their own values file or overriding specific values when installing or upgrading the chart.

This Redis Helm chart provides a flexible and feature-rich solution for deploying Redis on Kubernetes, suitable for various use cases from development environments to production-grade, highly available Redis clusters.
