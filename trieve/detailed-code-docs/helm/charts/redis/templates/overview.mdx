## High-level description
This directory contains Helm chart templates for deploying and configuring Redis in a Kubernetes environment. It includes templates for various Kubernetes resources such as ConfigMaps, Secrets, Services, Deployments/StatefulSets, NetworkPolicies, and monitoring resources. The templates are designed to support different Redis architectures, including standalone, replication, and sentinel modes.

## What does it do?
These templates collectively deploy and manage a Redis cluster in Kubernetes with the following key features:

1. Deployment of Redis master, replicas, and optionally sentinel nodes
2. Configuration management using ConfigMaps
3. Secret management for authentication and TLS
4. Service exposure for Redis and metrics
5. Network policies for traffic control
6. Horizontal Pod Autoscaling
7. Monitoring integration with Prometheus
8. RBAC configuration
9. Pod Disruption Budget for high availability
10. Service binding for easy application integration

The templates are highly configurable, allowing users to customize various aspects of the Redis deployment, such as authentication, persistence, replication, sentinel configuration, and monitoring.

## Entry points
The main entry points for this Redis Helm chart are:

1. `configmap.yaml`: Defines the core Redis configuration
2. `master/application.yaml`: Deploys the Redis master node
3. `replicas/application.yaml`: Deploys Redis replica nodes
4. `sentinel/statefulset.yaml`: Deploys Redis sentinel nodes (if enabled)

The control flow typically starts with the configuration resources (ConfigMaps, Secrets) being created, followed by the deployment of Redis nodes and associated services. Monitoring and network policies are applied as needed based on the configuration.

## Key Files

1. `configmap.yaml`: Contains Redis configuration for master, replica, and sentinel nodes
2. `scripts-configmap.yaml`: Includes shell scripts for node initialization and management
3. `secret.yaml` and `tls-secret.yaml`: Manage authentication and TLS secrets
4. `master/application.yaml` and `replicas/application.yaml`: Deploy Redis master and replica nodes
5. `sentinel/statefulset.yaml`: Deploys Redis sentinel nodes
6. `networkpolicy.yaml`: Defines network access rules for Redis pods
7. `metrics-svc.yaml` and `servicemonitor.yaml`: Set up metrics collection and monitoring
8. `pdb.yaml`: Defines Pod Disruption Budget for high availability
9. `role.yaml` and `rolebinding.yaml`: Configure RBAC for Redis pods

## Dependencies
The chart relies on the following main dependencies:

1. Redis container images (typically from Bitnami)
2. Kubernetes API (v1.23+)
3. Helm (v3.8.0+)
4. Prometheus Operator (optional, for ServiceMonitor)

## Configuration
The chart offers extensive configuration options through Helm values, including:

1. Redis architecture (standalone, replication, sentinel)
2. Authentication and TLS settings
3. Persistence configuration
4. Resource allocation and scaling
5. Monitoring and metrics collection
6. Network policies
7. Service types and port configurations
8. Custom scripts and configurations

For example, to enable sentinel mode with authentication:

```yaml
sentinel:
  enabled: true
auth:
  enabled: true
  password: "your-redis-password"
```

To configure persistence for the master node:

```yaml
master:
  persistence:
    enabled: true
    size: 8Gi
```

These templates provide a comprehensive and flexible solution for deploying Redis in various configurations on Kubernetes, with support for high availability, security, and monitoring.
