title: "extra-list.yaml"
---

## High-level description
This YAML template file is part of a Helm chart for Redis. It allows for the deployment of additional Kubernetes resources beyond the standard Redis components by iterating through a list of custom resource definitions provided in the chart's values.

## Code Structure
The file consists of a single range loop that iterates over the `extraDeploy` list from the chart's values.

## Symbols

### Range Loop
#### Description
This loop iterates over the `extraDeploy` list defined in the chart's values. For each item in the list, it renders the content using a common template function.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| .Values.extraDeploy | list | A list of additional Kubernetes resource definitions to be deployed |

#### Internal Logic
1. The loop starts with `{{- range .Values.extraDeploy }}`, indicating it will iterate over each item in the `extraDeploy` list.
2. For each iteration, it adds a YAML document separator `---`.
3. It then uses the `common.tplvalues.render` function to render the content of each item.
4. The `dict` function is used to pass a dictionary with two key-value pairs to the `common.tplvalues.render` function:
   - `"value"`: The current item from the `extraDeploy` list (represented by `.`)
   - `"context"`: The root context of the template (represented by `$`)

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| common.tplvalues.render | A helper function to render template values |

## Configuration
The primary configuration for this template comes from the `extraDeploy` list in the chart's values. Users can define additional Kubernetes resources in this list, which will be rendered and included in the final output.

## Notes
1. The file includes a copyright notice for VMware, Inc. with an APACHE-2.0 license.
2. This template provides flexibility for users to deploy custom resources alongside the standard Redis components without modifying the core chart templates.
3. The actual content and structure of the additional resources depend entirely on what users define in the `extraDeploy` list in their values file.
4. Care should be taken when using this feature to ensure that the additional resources are compatible with the Redis deployment and the target Kubernetes cluster.
