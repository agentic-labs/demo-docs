## High-level description
This Kubernetes manifest file defines a Redis master deployment or statefulset for a Redis cluster. It includes configurations for the Redis container, metrics exporter, and various Kubernetes-specific settings such as affinity rules, security contexts, and volume mounts.

## Code Structure
The main structure is a Kubernetes resource definition (Deployment or StatefulSet) for the Redis master. It includes specifications for the pod template, containers (Redis and optionally metrics), volumes, and various Kubernetes features like affinity, security contexts, and probes.

## Symbols

### `apiVersion`
#### Description
Specifies the Kubernetes API version for the resource.

### `kind`
#### Description
Defines the type of Kubernetes resource (Deployment or StatefulSet).

### `metadata`
#### Description
Contains metadata for the resource, including name, namespace, labels, and annotations.

### `spec`
#### Description
Defines the desired state for the Redis master deployment or statefulset.

### `spec.template`
#### Description
Defines the pod template for the Redis master.

### `spec.template.spec.containers`
#### Description
Specifies the containers to run in the pod, including the Redis container and optionally a metrics exporter.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Redis image | Main application container |
| Metrics exporter image | Optional container for exposing Prometheus metrics |

## Configuration
The manifest uses various configuration options defined in the Values file, including:

| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| master.kind | string | Specifies whether to use a Deployment or StatefulSet |
| master.count | integer | Number of Redis master replicas |
| auth.enabled | boolean | Whether to enable Redis authentication |
| tls.enabled | boolean | Whether to enable TLS for Redis connections |
| metrics.enabled | boolean | Whether to include a metrics exporter container |

## Error Handling
The manifest includes liveness and readiness probes for the Redis container to handle errors and ensure the container is running correctly.

## Logging
No specific logging configuration is present in this manifest.

## Performance Considerations
The manifest includes resource requests and limits for the Redis container, which can be configured to optimize performance.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code.

This manifest file is a comprehensive configuration for deploying a Redis master in Kubernetes, with various options for customization and monitoring.
