## High-level description

This YAML file defines a ConfigMap for a Redis Helm chart. It contains shell scripts used to start and manage Redis master, replica, and sentinel nodes in different deployment architectures (standalone or replication with sentinel). The scripts handle configuration, initialization, and graceful shutdown of Redis instances.

## Code Structure

The ConfigMap contains several shell scripts:
1. `start-node.sh`: Used in replication with sentinel architecture to start Redis nodes.
2. `start-sentinel.sh`: Used to start Redis sentinel nodes.
3. `prestop-sentinel.sh`: Handles graceful shutdown of sentinel nodes.
4. `prestop-redis.sh`: Handles graceful shutdown of Redis nodes.
5. `start-master.sh`: Used to start Redis master node in standalone or replication architecture.
6. `start-replica.sh`: Used to start Redis replica nodes in replication architecture.

These scripts are interconnected and share common functions and logic for node discovery, configuration, and management.

## Symbols

### `start-node.sh`
#### Description
This script is used to start Redis nodes in a replication with sentinel architecture. It determines whether the node should be a master or replica, configures the node, and starts the Redis server.

#### Internal Logic
1. Defines utility functions for port and hostname resolution.
2. Determines the node's role (master or replica) based on sentinel information or persisted configuration.
3. Configures the node with appropriate settings (e.g., replication, TLS, authentication).
4. Starts the Redis server with the configured arguments.

### `start-sentinel.sh`
#### Description
This script starts Redis sentinel nodes, configuring them to monitor the Redis master and manage failover.

#### Internal Logic
1. Configures sentinel settings (e.g., master set, quorum, known sentinels and replicas).
2. Sets up TLS if enabled.
3. Starts the Redis server in sentinel mode.

### `prestop-sentinel.sh` and `prestop-redis.sh`
#### Description
These scripts handle graceful shutdown of sentinel and Redis nodes, ensuring proper failover if necessary.

#### Internal Logic
1. Check if the node is a master.
2. If it's a master, initiate a failover process.
3. Wait for failover to complete before shutting down.

### `start-master.sh` and `start-replica.sh`
#### Description
These scripts are used in standalone or replication architecture to start Redis master and replica nodes, respectively.

#### Internal Logic
1. Configure node-specific settings (e.g., persistence, TLS, authentication).
2. Set up replication for replica nodes.
3. Start the Redis server with appropriate arguments.

## Dependencies
The scripts rely on the following external tools and libraries:
- Redis CLI
- OpenSSL (for TLS configuration)
- Standard Unix utilities (e.g., awk, sed, grep)

## Configuration
The scripts use various environment variables and Helm chart values to configure Redis nodes. Key configuration options include:
- TLS settings
- Authentication credentials
- Replication and sentinel parameters
- Custom flags and commands

## Error Handling
The scripts implement basic error handling and retries for operations like hostname resolution and sentinel commands.

## Performance Considerations
The scripts include mechanisms for proper node discovery and failover, which are crucial for maintaining high availability and performance in a Redis cluster.

This ConfigMap provides a flexible and robust way to manage Redis deployments in various architectures, handling different scenarios and configurations within a Kubernetes environment.
