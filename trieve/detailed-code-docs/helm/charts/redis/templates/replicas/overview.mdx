## High-level description
This directory contains Kubernetes manifest templates for deploying Redis replicas in a Helm chart. It includes configurations for the main application deployment, horizontal pod autoscaling, service exposure, and service account creation. These templates are designed to work together to create a fully functional Redis replica setup in a Kubernetes environment.

## What does it do?
This set of templates collectively deploys and manages Redis replicas in a Kubernetes cluster. Here's a breakdown of the main functionalities:

1. Deploys Redis replica pods using either a StatefulSet or DaemonSet, depending on the configuration.
2. Sets up automatic scaling of replica pods based on CPU and memory utilization.
3. Creates a Kubernetes Service to expose the Redis replicas, allowing other components to connect to them.
4. Optionally creates a ServiceAccount for the Redis replicas, which can be used for authentication and authorization within the cluster.

The templates are highly configurable, allowing users to customize various aspects of the deployment, such as replication settings, security contexts, persistence options, metrics collection, and resource allocation.

## Key Files

1. `application.yaml`: This is the main template for deploying Redis replicas. It defines a StatefulSet or DaemonSet that manages the Redis replica pods, including their configuration, security settings, persistence, and optional metrics exporter.

2. `hpa.yaml`: This template creates a Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) for the Redis replicas. It automatically adjusts the number of replica pods based on CPU and memory utilization, ensuring optimal performance and resource usage.

3. `service.yaml`: This template defines a Kubernetes Service resource that exposes the Redis replica pods, allowing other components to connect to the Redis replicas.

4. `serviceaccount.yaml`: This template conditionally creates a Kubernetes ServiceAccount for the Redis replicas, which can be used for authentication and authorization purposes within the cluster.

## Dependencies
The templates in this directory rely on the following main dependencies:

1. Redis image: The main application container used for running Redis replicas.
2. Metrics exporter image: An optional container for exposing Prometheus metrics from Redis.
3. Kubernetes: These templates are designed to work with Kubernetes and utilize its features for deployment, scaling, and service management.
4. Helm: The templates use Helm's templating language and functions for dynamic configuration and rendering.

## Configuration
The Redis replica deployment can be extensively configured through Helm values. Some key configuration options include:

1. Redis replication settings
2. Security contexts and authentication
3. Persistence options for data storage
4. Metrics and monitoring configuration
5. Affinity and tolerations for pod scheduling
6. Resource requests and limits
7. Autoscaling settings (min/max replicas, target CPU/memory utilization)
8. Service type and port configurations
9. ServiceAccount creation and settings

For example, to enable autoscaling for replicas, you would set:

```yaml
replica:
  autoscaling:
    enabled: true
    minReplicas: 3
    maxReplicas: 10
    targetCPU: 50
    targetMemory: 50
```

To configure the replica service, you might use:

```yaml
replica:
  service:
    type: ClusterIP
    ports:
      redis: 6379
    annotations:
      custom.annotation: "value"
```

These templates provide a flexible and powerful way to deploy and manage Redis replicas in a Kubernetes environment, with options for high availability, scalability, persistence, and monitoring.
