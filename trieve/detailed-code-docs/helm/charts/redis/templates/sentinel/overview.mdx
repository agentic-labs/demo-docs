## High-level description
This directory contains Helm chart templates for deploying Redis Sentinel in a Kubernetes environment. It includes configurations for horizontal pod autoscaling, node services, port allocation, main service, and the core StatefulSet for Redis replicas with Sentinel.

## What does it do?
These templates work together to create a highly available Redis cluster using the Sentinel architecture. Here's a breakdown of the main components:

1. Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA): Automatically scales the number of Redis replica pods based on CPU and memory utilization.
2. Node Services: Creates NodePort services for each Redis Sentinel node, exposing both Sentinel and Redis ports.
3. Ports ConfigMap: Dynamically allocates unused NodePort numbers for Redis and Sentinel services to avoid conflicts.
4. Main Service: Defines a Kubernetes Service for Redis Sentinel, supporting different service types (ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer).
5. StatefulSet: Deploys Redis replicas with Sentinel, including configurations for authentication, persistence, networking, and scaling.

This setup allows for a flexible and scalable Redis deployment with high availability features provided by Sentinel.

## Key Files

1. `hpa.yaml`: Defines the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler for Redis replica nodes.
2. `node-services.yaml`: Creates NodePort services for each Redis Sentinel node.
3. `ports-configmap.yaml`: Generates a ConfigMap for dynamic NodePort allocation.
4. `service.yaml`: Defines the main Kubernetes Service for Redis Sentinel.
5. `statefulset.yaml`: Sets up the StatefulSet for Redis replicas with Sentinel.

## Dependencies
The templates rely on the following dependencies:

1. Bitnami Redis container images
2. Kubernetes v1.23+
3. Helm v3.8.0+

These dependencies are used to provide the Redis functionality and integrate with the Kubernetes ecosystem.

## Configuration
The templates offer extensive configuration options through Helm values. Some key configurable aspects include:

1. Autoscaling settings (min/max replicas, target CPU/memory utilization)
2. Service types (ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer)
3. Port configurations for Redis and Sentinel
4. Authentication settings
5. Persistence options
6. Resource allocation
7. Security contexts
8. Probes and health checks
9. Affinity and anti-affinity rules
10. Scaling and update strategies

For example, in the `hpa.yaml` file, you can configure autoscaling like this:

```yaml
replica:
  autoscaling:
    enabled: true
    minReplicas: 3
    maxReplicas: 10
    targetCPU: 50
    targetMemory: 50
```

Similarly, in the `service.yaml` file, you can set up the service type and ports:

```yaml
sentinel:
  service:
    type: LoadBalancer
    ports:
      redis: 6379
      sentinel: 26379
```

These configuration options allow for fine-tuning the Redis Sentinel deployment to meet specific requirements and adapt to different environments.

The templates also include error handling mechanisms, such as various probes (startup, liveness, readiness) in the StatefulSet configuration, to handle and recover from potential failures in the Redis pods.

Overall, this directory provides a comprehensive set of templates for deploying a robust, scalable, and configurable Redis Sentinel cluster in a Kubernetes environment.
