## High-level description

This file contains the configuration values for deploying a Redis cluster using Helm. It defines various parameters for Redis master and replica nodes, Sentinel configuration, metrics, security settings, and other deployment options.

## Code Structure

The file is structured as a YAML configuration with nested key-value pairs. The main sections include global parameters, common parameters, Redis master and replica configurations, Sentinel settings, metrics, and various other deployment-related options.

## Symbols

### global
#### Description
Defines global parameters for the Redis deployment, including image registry, pull secrets, storage class, and global Redis password.

### master
#### Description
Configures the Redis master node, including its persistence, service, and security settings.

### replica
#### Description
Configures Redis replica nodes, including the number of replicas, persistence, and service settings.

### sentinel
#### Description
Configures Redis Sentinel, which provides high availability for Redis deployments.

### metrics
#### Description
Configures Prometheus metrics exporter for Redis.

### volumePermissions
#### Description
Configures an init container to set volume permissions.

### sysctl
#### Description
Configures an init container to modify kernel settings.

## Dependencies

The chart depends on the Bitnami Redis and Redis Exporter images, which are pulled from Docker Hub.

## Configuration

The file provides extensive configuration options, including:

- Redis version and image settings
- Authentication and security settings
- Persistence configuration
- Resource allocation for master and replica nodes
- Network policies and service configurations
- Metrics and monitoring settings
- Init container configurations

## Error Handling

Error handling is not explicitly defined in this configuration file. It would be handled by the Helm chart's templates and the Kubernetes cluster itself.

## Logging

Logging configuration is not directly specified in this file. It would typically be handled by the Redis configuration or the Kubernetes cluster's logging mechanisms.

This configuration file provides a comprehensive set of options for deploying a customizable and scalable Redis cluster with Helm, allowing users to fine-tune various aspects of the deployment to suit their specific requirements.
