## High-level description
This directory contains the Bitnami Common Library Chart, which is a Helm Library Chart designed to group common logic and helper functions used across various Bitnami charts. It's not meant to be deployed independently but serves as a shared resource for other charts.

## What does it do?
The Common Library Chart provides a set of reusable templates, helper functions, and common logic that can be utilized by other Helm charts. This approach helps to standardize and simplify the development of Helm charts by providing a consistent set of tools and patterns. It includes functionality for handling common tasks such as:

1. Naming conventions
2. Label management
3. Image configuration
4. Secret management
5. Persistence configuration
6. Value validation

By using this library, chart developers can focus on the specific requirements of their application while leveraging pre-built solutions for common Kubernetes and Helm patterns.

## Key Files

1. **Chart.yaml**: This file defines the metadata for the Common Library Chart. It specifies the chart name, version, type (library), and other relevant information. The chart is versioned at 2.19.1 and is licensed under Apache-2.0.

2. **README.md**: Provides comprehensive documentation on how to use the Common Library Chart. It includes installation instructions, prerequisites, and detailed explanations of various helper functions and patterns provided by the library.

3. **values.yaml**: Contains a minimal set of default values for the chart. It includes an `exampleValue` key, which is likely used for testing or CI/CD purposes.

## Dependencies
The Common Library Chart itself does not have external dependencies. However, it is designed to be used as a dependency by other Bitnami charts. To use this library in another chart, you would typically add it as a dependency in the chart's `Chart.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  - name: common
    version: 2.x.x
    repository: oci://registry-1.docker.io/bitnamicharts
```

## Configuration
The Common Library Chart provides various configuration options and helper functions. Some key configuration patterns include:

1. **ImageRoot**: A schema for configuring container images, including registry, repository, tag, and pull policy.

   Example:
   ```yaml
   registry: docker.io
   repository: bitnami/nginx
   tag: 1.16.1-debian-10-r63
   pullPolicy: IfNotPresent
   debug: false
   ```

2. **Persistence**: A schema for configuring persistent storage.

   Example:
   ```yaml
   enabled: true
   storageClass: "-"
   accessMode: ReadWriteOnce
   size: 8Gi
   path: /bitnami
   ```

3. **ExistingSecret**: A schema for referencing existing Kubernetes secrets.

   Example:
   ```yaml
   name: mySecret
   keyMapping:
     password: myPasswordKey
   ```

4. **ValidateValue**: A mechanism for validating required values and providing helpful error messages.

The library also includes various helper templates for common tasks such as generating full names, labels, and managing secrets. These can be used in other charts to standardize naming conventions and reduce boilerplate code.

In conclusion, the Bitnami Common Library Chart serves as a powerful tool for Helm chart developers, providing a set of standardized patterns and helper functions that can significantly simplify the process of creating and maintaining Kubernetes applications using Helm.
