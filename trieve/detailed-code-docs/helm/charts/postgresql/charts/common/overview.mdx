## High-level description
The `common` directory is a Helm library chart within the PostgreSQL chart. It serves as a repository for shared logic, templates, and functionalities that can be used across various Bitnami charts. This library chart is not meant to be deployed independently but rather to be included as a dependency in other charts.

## What does it do?
The `common` chart provides a set of reusable Helm templates and helper functions that simplify the development and maintenance of other Helm charts. It includes common logic for tasks such as:

1. Generating consistent naming conventions for resources
2. Managing image configurations
3. Handling persistence and storage options
4. Dealing with secrets and sensitive data
5. Validating input values

By centralizing these common functionalities, it reduces duplication of code across different charts and ensures consistency in how certain operations are performed.

## Key Files
1. `Chart.yaml`: This file defines the metadata for the `common` chart, including its version, description, and type (library).

2. `README.md`: Provides documentation on how to use the common library chart, including examples of how to include it as a dependency and use its templates.

3. `values.yaml`: Contains default values for the chart. In this case, it only includes an example value that is marked to be skipped during rendering.

## Dependencies
The `common` chart itself does not have external dependencies. However, it is designed to be used as a dependency in other Helm charts. To use this library chart, other charts would include it in their `Chart.yaml` file like this:

```yaml
dependencies:
  - name: common
    version: 2.x.x
    repository: oci://registry-1.docker.io/bitnamicharts
```

## Configuration
The `common` chart provides several special input schemas that can be used in charts that depend on it:

1. `ImageRoot`: Used for configuring container images, including registry, repository, tag, and pull policy.

2. `Persistence`: Configures persistence options for volumes, including storage class, access mode, and size.

3. `ExistingSecret`: Allows referencing existing Kubernetes secrets for sensitive data.

4. `ValidateValue`: Provides a mechanism for validating input values and generating helpful error messages.

These schemas are not configured directly in the `common` chart but are used as templates for other charts to implement their own configuration options.

The `values.yaml` file in the `common` chart contains only an example value:

```yaml
exampleValue: "common-chart" # @skip
```

This value is marked with `@skip`, indicating that it should be ignored during Helm template rendering and is likely used for demonstration purposes only.

In summary, the `common` directory contains a Helm library chart that provides a set of shared templates and helper functions for use in other Bitnami charts. It simplifies chart development by centralizing common logic and ensuring consistency across different charts in the repository.
