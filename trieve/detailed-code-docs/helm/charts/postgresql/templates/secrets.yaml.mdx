## High-level description
This Helm chart template file (secrets.yaml) is responsible for creating Kubernetes Secret resources for a PostgreSQL deployment. It generates and manages various passwords and credentials required for PostgreSQL authentication, replication, and service binding.

## Code Structure
The file consists of multiple sections that define different Secret resources:
1. Main PostgreSQL Secret
2. Service Binding Secrets (optional)

Each section uses Helm templating to dynamically generate the Secret content based on the provided values and configurations.

## Symbols

### Main PostgreSQL Secret
#### Description
This section creates the primary Secret resource for PostgreSQL authentication.

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves various passwords and credentials using Helm templating functions.
2. Conditionally includes different types of passwords based on the configuration.
3. Creates a Secret resource with the gathered credentials.

### Service Binding Secrets
#### Description
These sections create additional Secret resources for service binding, if enabled.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if service binding is enabled.
2. Creates separate Secrets for the postgres user and custom user (if applicable).
3. Includes connection details like host, port, username, password, and database.
4. Generates a URI for connecting to the PostgreSQL instance.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| common | Provides helper functions for naming and secret management |

## Configuration
The template uses various configuration options, including:
| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| architecture | string | Determines if replication is enabled |
| auth.enablePostgresUser | boolean | Enables the postgres admin user |
| serviceBindings.enabled | boolean | Enables creation of service binding secrets |

## Error Handling
The template includes conditional checks to handle cases where certain passwords or configurations are not provided, ensuring that the Secret resources are created correctly based on the available information.

## API/Interface Reference
This template creates Kubernetes Secret resources with the following types:
1. Opaque (for the main PostgreSQL Secret)
2. servicebinding.io/postgresql (for service binding Secrets)

These Secrets can be consumed by other Kubernetes resources that require PostgreSQL credentials and connection information.
