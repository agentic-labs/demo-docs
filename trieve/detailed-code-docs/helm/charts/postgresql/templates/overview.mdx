## High-level description
This directory contains Helm chart templates for deploying and managing PostgreSQL in a Kubernetes environment. It includes configurations for the primary PostgreSQL instance, read replicas, backups, monitoring, and various supporting resources such as secrets, service accounts, and network policies.

## What does it do?
The templates in this directory work together to create a comprehensive PostgreSQL deployment with the following capabilities:

1. Deploy a primary PostgreSQL instance using a StatefulSet with persistent storage.
2. Set up read replicas for improved read performance and scalability.
3. Configure automated backups using a CronJob.
4. Implement network policies for secure communication between components.
5. Set up monitoring and metrics collection using Prometheus.
6. Manage secrets for authentication and TLS certificates.
7. Create necessary RBAC resources (Role and RoleBinding) for proper permissions.
8. Allow for custom resource deployment through the `extraDeploy` feature.

These components work together to provide a robust, scalable, and secure PostgreSQL deployment in a Kubernetes environment, suitable for various use cases from development to production.

## Entry points
The main entry points for this directory are:

1. `primary/statefulset.yaml`: Defines the core PostgreSQL deployment as a StatefulSet.
2. `read/statefulset.yaml`: Sets up read replicas if enabled.
3. `backup/cronjob.yaml`: Configures automated backups.
4. `secrets.yaml`: Manages authentication secrets.
5. `serviceaccount.yaml`: Creates the necessary service account.

The deployment flow typically starts with the creation of secrets and service accounts, followed by the primary PostgreSQL instance, then read replicas and backups if enabled. Network policies, monitoring resources, and additional custom resources are set up alongside these core components.

## Key Files
1. `primary/`: Contains templates for the primary PostgreSQL instance, including StatefulSet, Services, ConfigMaps, and NetworkPolicies.
2. `read/`: Similar to `primary/`, but for read replicas.
3. `backup/`: Includes templates for setting up automated backups.
4. `secrets.yaml`: Manages various secrets for PostgreSQL authentication and credentials.
5. `serviceaccount.yaml`: Defines the ServiceAccount used by PostgreSQL pods.
6. `role.yaml` and `rolebinding.yaml`: Set up RBAC permissions.
7. `prometheusrule.yaml`: Defines alerting rules for Prometheus monitoring.
8. `tls-secrets.yaml`: Manages TLS certificates for secure communication.

## Dependencies
The templates in this directory rely on several external components:

1. Kubernetes: These templates are designed for Kubernetes 1.19+.
2. Helm: The chart uses Helm v3 for templating and deployment management.
3. PostgreSQL: The specific version is configurable, but templates are designed for PostgreSQL 14.x and later.
4. Prometheus Operator: For ServiceMonitor and PrometheusRule resources.
5. cert-manager (optional): Can be used for TLS certificate management.

## Configuration
The templates offer extensive configuration options through Helm values, including:

1. PostgreSQL version, settings, and resource allocation.
2. Replication and read replica configuration.
3. Backup schedules and retention policies.
4. Security settings (RBAC, NetworkPolicy, TLS).
5. Monitoring and metrics options.
6. Custom initialization scripts and configurations.

Users can customize these settings in the `values.yaml` file or by passing values during Helm installation or upgrade. The flexibility in configuration allows this chart to be used in various environments, from development to production, with appropriate settings for each scenario.
