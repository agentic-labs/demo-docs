title: "psp.yaml"
---

## High-level description
This YAML file defines a Kubernetes PodSecurityPolicy (PSP) for a PostgreSQL deployment using Helm. It sets up security constraints for pods running PostgreSQL, ensuring they operate with specific privileges and restrictions.

## Code Structure
The file consists of a single Kubernetes resource definition (PodSecurityPolicy) wrapped in a conditional block. It uses Helm templating to dynamically generate values and include common labels and annotations.

### PodSecurityPolicy
#### Description
Defines a PodSecurityPolicy named after the release fullname, setting security constraints for PostgreSQL pods.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| .Values.psp.create | Boolean | Determines if the PSP should be created |
| .Values.commonLabels | Map | Custom labels to be applied |
| .Values.commonAnnotations | Map | Custom annotations to be applied |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if PSP is supported and creation is enabled
2. Sets metadata (name, namespace, labels, annotations)
3. Defines spec with security constraints:
   - Disables privileged mode
   - Allows specific volume types
   - Disables host network, IPC, and PID access
   - Sets rules for user, group, and SELinux contexts
   - Configures filesystem permissions

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| common.capabilities.psp.supported | Checks if PSP is supported in the cluster |
| common.names.fullname | Generates the full name for the resource |
| common.labels.standard | Applies standard labels |
| common.tplvalues.render | Renders template values |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| psp.create | Boolean | N/A | Enables creation of the PodSecurityPolicy |
| commonLabels | Map | N/A | Custom labels to apply to the resource |
| commonAnnotations | Map | N/A | Custom annotations to apply to the resource |

## Notes
1. This file is part of a Helm chart for PostgreSQL deployment.
2. It uses conditional rendering based on PSP support and the `psp.create` value.
3. The PSP is relatively permissive, allowing various volume types and not enforcing a read-only root filesystem.
4. The policy uses "RunAsAny" for user and SELinux contexts, which may need to be tightened in high-security environments.
5. Supplemental groups and fsGroup are restricted to the range 1-65535.
