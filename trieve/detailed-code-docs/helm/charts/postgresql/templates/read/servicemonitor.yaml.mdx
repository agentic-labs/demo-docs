## High-level description
This YAML file defines a ServiceMonitor resource for monitoring PostgreSQL read replicas in a Kubernetes environment. It is specifically designed for use with Prometheus Operator and is conditionally created based on certain configuration values.

## Code Structure
The file consists of a single ServiceMonitor resource definition with various nested fields. The structure is heavily templated, using Helm's templating syntax to dynamically generate values based on the chart's configuration.

## Symbols

### ServiceMonitor
#### Description
Defines a ServiceMonitor resource for monitoring PostgreSQL read replicas. It is created only when metrics are enabled, ServiceMonitor is enabled, and the architecture is set to "replication".

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| .Values.metrics.enabled | boolean | Determines if metrics are enabled |
| .Values.metrics.serviceMonitor.enabled | boolean | Determines if ServiceMonitor should be created |
| .Values.architecture | string | Must be "replication" for this resource to be created |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if metrics are enabled, ServiceMonitor is enabled, and architecture is "replication".
2. Sets metadata including name, namespace, labels, and annotations.
3. Defines the spec for the ServiceMonitor, including job label, selector, endpoints, and namespace selector.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| monitoring.coreos.com/v1 | API version for ServiceMonitor resource |

### Configuration
The ServiceMonitor configuration is highly customizable through various `.Values` options:

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| .Values.metrics.serviceMonitor.namespace | string | .Release.Namespace | Namespace for the ServiceMonitor |
| .Values.metrics.serviceMonitor.labels | object | - | Additional labels for the ServiceMonitor |
| .Values.commonLabels | object | - | Common labels to be applied |
| .Values.commonAnnotations | object | - | Common annotations to be applied |
| .Values.metrics.serviceMonitor.jobLabel | string | - | Job label for the ServiceMonitor |
| .Values.metrics.serviceMonitor.selector | object | - | Selector for the ServiceMonitor |
| .Values.metrics.serviceMonitor.interval | string | - | Scrape interval |
| .Values.metrics.serviceMonitor.scrapeTimeout | string | - | Scrape timeout |
| .Values.metrics.serviceMonitor.relabelings | array | - | Relabeling configurations |
| .Values.metrics.serviceMonitor.metricRelabelings | array | - | Metric relabeling configurations |
| .Values.metrics.serviceMonitor.honorLabels | boolean | - | Whether to honor labels |

## Notes
- This file is part of a Helm chart for PostgreSQL and is specifically for monitoring read replicas in a replication setup.
- It uses several custom template functions (e.g., `include "postgresql.v1.readReplica.fullname"`) which are likely defined in other files within the chart.
- The ServiceMonitor is designed to work with Prometheus Operator, which is commonly used for monitoring in Kubernetes environments.
- The configuration is highly flexible, allowing for customization of labels, annotations, job labels, selectors, and various monitoring parameters.
