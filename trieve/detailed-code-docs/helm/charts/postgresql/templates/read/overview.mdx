## High-level description
This directory contains Helm chart templates for deploying and managing PostgreSQL read replicas in a Kubernetes environment. It is specifically designed for a replication architecture where read-only instances are set up to offload queries from the primary PostgreSQL instance.

## What does it do?
The templates in this directory work together to create a complete setup for PostgreSQL read replicas:

1. They deploy a StatefulSet of read-only PostgreSQL instances that replicate data from a primary instance.
2. They set up various Kubernetes Services to expose these read replicas both internally and externally.
3. They configure network policies to control traffic to and from the read replica pods.
4. They set up monitoring and metrics collection for the read replicas.
5. They manage configuration for both PostgreSQL and metrics collection.

This setup allows for scalable read capacity in a PostgreSQL cluster, improving performance for read-heavy workloads while maintaining data consistency through replication from the primary instance.

## Key Files

1. **statefulset.yaml**: Defines the core StatefulSet for PostgreSQL read replicas. It sets up the PostgreSQL containers, configures replication, manages persistent storage, and optionally includes a metrics exporter.

2. **svc.yaml** and **svc-headless.yaml**: Create Kubernetes Services to expose the read replicas. The regular service is for general access, while the headless service is used for inter-pod communication, especially during initialization.

3. **networkpolicy.yaml**: Establishes network access rules for the read replica pods, controlling both ingress and egress traffic to ensure secure communication within the cluster.

4. **metrics-svc.yaml** and **servicemonitor.yaml**: Set up monitoring for the read replicas when metrics are enabled. They create a Service to expose metrics and a ServiceMonitor for Prometheus to scrape these metrics.

5. **extended-configmap.yaml** and **metrics-configmap.yaml**: Manage configuration for PostgreSQL and metrics collection, allowing for customization of the read replica setup.

## Dependencies
The templates in this directory rely on several external components:

1. **PostgreSQL Docker Image**: The core database engine used for the read replicas.
2. **Metrics Exporter Image**: Optional component for exposing PostgreSQL metrics.
3. **Prometheus Operator**: Used in conjunction with the ServiceMonitor for metrics collection.
4. **Kubernetes NetworkPolicy API**: Required for implementing network access controls.

## Configuration
The behavior of these templates can be extensively customized through values in the Helm chart's `values.yaml` file. Key configuration options include:

- `readReplicas.replicaCount`: Number of read replica pods to deploy.
- `readReplicas.persistence.enabled`: Whether to use persistent storage for data.
- `readReplicas.resources`: CPU and memory resource requests and limits.
- `metrics.enabled`: Whether to enable the PostgreSQL metrics exporter.
- `readReplicas.networkPolicy`: Configuration for network access controls.
- `readReplicas.service`: Settings for the Kubernetes Services exposing the read replicas.

These templates provide a flexible and scalable way to deploy PostgreSQL read replicas in a Kubernetes environment, with options for customization, monitoring, and security.
