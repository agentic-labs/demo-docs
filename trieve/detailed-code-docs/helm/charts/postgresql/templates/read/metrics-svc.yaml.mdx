title: "metrics-svc.yaml"
---

## High-level description
This YAML template defines a Kubernetes Service for PostgreSQL metrics in a read-replica setup. It's specifically designed to expose metrics for read replicas when metrics are enabled and the architecture is set to replication mode.

## Symbols

### Conditional Block
#### Description
The entire Service definition is wrapped in a conditional block that checks if metrics are enabled and the architecture is set to replication.

```yaml
{{- if and .Values.metrics.enabled (eq .Values.architecture "replication") }}
# ... Service definition ...
{{- end }}
```

### Service Definition
#### Description
Defines a Kubernetes Service resource for exposing PostgreSQL metrics from read replicas.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the API version and kind for a Kubernetes Service.
2. Defines metadata including name, namespace, labels, and annotations.
3. Specifies the Service type as ClusterIP.
4. Configures the port for metrics exposure.
5. Sets the selector to target read replica pods.

### Metadata
#### Description
Defines the Service's metadata, including its name, namespace, labels, and annotations.

#### Internal Logic
- Uses Helm templating to generate the Service name.
- Sets the namespace from the Release.Namespace value.
- Applies common labels and custom labels for the metrics read component.
- Conditionally adds annotations if specified in values.

### Spec
#### Description
Specifies the Service configuration, including type, session affinity, cluster IP, and port details.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets the Service type to ClusterIP.
- Configures session affinity from values.
- Optionally sets a specific cluster IP if provided.
- Defines a port named "http-metrics" with the port number from values.
- Sets the selector to target read replica pods using labels.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| common | Provides helper templates for labels, annotations, and value merging |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| .Values.metrics.enabled | boolean | - | Enables or disables metrics collection |
| .Values.architecture | string | - | Defines the PostgreSQL architecture (must be "replication" for this Service) |
| .Values.metrics.service.sessionAffinity | string | - | Sets the session affinity for the Service |
| .Values.metrics.service.clusterIP | string | - | Optional: Sets a specific cluster IP for the Service |
| .Values.metrics.service.ports.metrics | number | - | Defines the port number for the metrics endpoint |

Note: This template is part of a larger Helm chart for PostgreSQL and relies on values that would be defined in the chart's values.yaml file or overridden during installation.
