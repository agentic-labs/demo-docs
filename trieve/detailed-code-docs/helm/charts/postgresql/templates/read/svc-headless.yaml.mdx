## High-level description
This YAML file defines a headless Kubernetes Service for PostgreSQL read replicas in a replication architecture. It's designed to expose all read replica pods, including those not yet ready, to facilitate communication between PostgreSQL pods during the initialization process.

### Service Definition
#### Description
Defines a headless Kubernetes Service for PostgreSQL read replicas.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| .Values.architecture | string | The PostgreSQL deployment architecture |
| .Release.Namespace | string | The Kubernetes namespace for the release |
| .Values.commonLabels | map | Common labels to be applied to the service |
| .Values.readReplicas.service.headless.annotations | map | Annotations for the headless service |
| .Values.commonAnnotations | map | Common annotations to be applied to the service |
| .Values.readReplicas.podLabels | map | Labels for the read replica pods |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the architecture is "replication".
2. Sets the service name using a template function.
3. Applies labels and annotations, merging common and specific ones.
4. Configures the service as headless (ClusterIP: None) with publishNotReadyAddresses set to true.
5. Defines a port for PostgreSQL traffic.
6. Sets the selector to match read replica pods.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| common | Provides helper templates for labels, annotations, and value merging |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| .Values.architecture | string | N/A | Must be "replication" for this service to be created |
| .Values.readReplicas.service.headless.annotations | map | {} | Custom annotations for the headless service |
| .Values.readReplicas.service.port | number | N/A | Port number for the PostgreSQL service |

## Notes
1. The service uses the `service.alpha.kubernetes.io/tolerate-unready-endpoints: "true"` annotation to ensure compatibility with older Kubernetes versions that have issues with the `publishNotReadyAddresses` field.
2. The service is designed to publish addresses for all pods, including those not ready, to facilitate inter-pod communication during the PostgreSQL cluster initialization process.
