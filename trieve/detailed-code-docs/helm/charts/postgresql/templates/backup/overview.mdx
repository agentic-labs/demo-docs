## High-level description

This directory contains Helm chart templates for managing PostgreSQL backups in a Kubernetes environment. It includes configurations for a CronJob to perform scheduled backups, a NetworkPolicy to control network traffic for the backup process, and a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) for storing backup data.

## What does it do?

This set of templates enables automated, scheduled backups of a PostgreSQL database cluster running in Kubernetes. Here's a breakdown of the functionality:

1. Scheduled Backups: A CronJob is set up to run `pg_dumpall` at specified intervals, creating full backups of the PostgreSQL cluster.

2. Network Security: A NetworkPolicy is implemented to control the outbound traffic from the backup pods, ensuring they can only connect to the PostgreSQL service on its default port (5432).

3. Persistent Storage: A PVC is created to provide durable storage for the backup data, ensuring that backups are retained even if the backup pod is terminated.

These components work together to create a robust, secure, and configurable backup solution for PostgreSQL databases in a Kubernetes environment.

## Key Files

1. `cronjob.yaml`: This file defines the CronJob resource for scheduled PostgreSQL backups. It specifies the backup schedule, container configuration, and volume mounts for storing backups and certificates.

2. `networkpolicy.yaml`: This file creates a NetworkPolicy resource to control egress traffic for the backup CronJob, allowing outbound connections only to the PostgreSQL port.

3. `pvc.yaml`: This file defines a PersistentVolumeClaim for storing PostgreSQL backups, providing persistent storage for the backup data.

## Dependencies

The templates in this directory primarily depend on the PostgreSQL database itself, which is the target of the backup operations. They also rely on Kubernetes resources and APIs, including CronJob, NetworkPolicy, and PersistentVolumeClaim.

## Configuration

The backup functionality is highly configurable through Helm values. Key configuration options include:

1. Enabling/disabling backups: 
   ```yaml
   backup:
     enabled: true
   ```

2. CronJob schedule:
   ```yaml
   backup:
     cronjob:
       schedule: "0 1 * * *"  # Daily at 1 AM
   ```

3. Network policy:
   ```yaml
   backup:
     cronjob:
       networkPolicy:
         enabled: true
   ```

4. Persistent storage:
   ```yaml
   backup:
     cronjob:
       storage:
         enabled: true
         size: "10Gi"
         accessModes:
           - ReadWriteOnce
   ```

5. Resource limits and requests for the backup container:
   ```yaml
   backup:
     cronjob:
       resources:
         limits:
           cpu: 100m
           memory: 128Mi
         requests:
           cpu: 100m
           memory: 128Mi
   ```

These configurations allow users to fine-tune the backup process according to their specific requirements, including scheduling, network security, storage capacity, and resource allocation.

The templates make extensive use of conditional logic to create resources only when they are enabled in the configuration, providing flexibility in deployment scenarios.
