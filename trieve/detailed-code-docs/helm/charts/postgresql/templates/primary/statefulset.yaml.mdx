title: "statefulset.yaml"

## High-level description
This YAML file defines a Kubernetes StatefulSet for deploying a PostgreSQL database. It includes configurations for container specifications, volume mounts, environment variables, and various other Kubernetes-specific settings to manage the PostgreSQL deployment.

## Code Structure
The file is structured as a Kubernetes StatefulSet resource, with nested fields for metadata, spec, and template configurations. It uses extensive templating via the Helm chart templating syntax to allow for customization of various aspects of the deployment.

## Symbols

### StatefulSet
#### Description
Defines a Kubernetes StatefulSet resource for deploying and managing PostgreSQL.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets up metadata including name, labels, and annotations
- Configures the StatefulSet spec with replicas, service name, and update strategy
- Defines a pod template with container specifications, volume mounts, and environment variables
- Handles various conditional logic based on configuration values (e.g., TLS, LDAP, replication)

### Container: postgresql
#### Description
Specifies the main PostgreSQL container within the pod template.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets up the container image, security context, and resource requirements
- Configures a large number of environment variables for PostgreSQL settings
- Defines probes for liveness, readiness, and startup checks
- Sets up volume mounts for data persistence and configuration

### Container: metrics (optional)
#### Description
An optional sidecar container for exporting PostgreSQL metrics.

#### Internal Logic
- Only included if metrics are enabled in the configuration
- Sets up the metrics exporter with appropriate environment variables and ports
- Configures probes for health checking

## Dependencies
The file relies heavily on Helm chart templating functions and helpers, likely defined in other files within the chart.

## Configuration
The StatefulSet's behavior can be extensively customized through Helm values, with many conditional blocks based on these values.

## Error Handling
Error handling is primarily managed through Kubernetes probes (liveness, readiness, startup) defined for the containers.

## Logging
No explicit logging configuration is present in this file. Logging would typically be handled by the PostgreSQL process itself.

This StatefulSet definition provides a comprehensive and highly configurable way to deploy PostgreSQL in a Kubernetes environment, with options for replication, metrics, security settings, and more.
