title: "Overview"
---

I apologize, but it seems the content was cut off before I could finish summarizing all the inputs for the `primary` section and subsequent sections. However, I can provide a high-level overview of the remaining structure based on the information available:

The `values.yaml` file continues to define configuration options for various aspects of the PostgreSQL deployment, including:

- `readReplicas`: Configuration for read-only replica instances, with similar options to the `primary` section.
- `backup`: Settings for configuring database backups, including scheduling and storage options.
- `volumePermissions`: Configuration for managing volume permissions using init containers.
- `metrics`: Options for enabling and configuring Prometheus metrics exporter.
- `serviceAccount`: Settings for creating and configuring a Kubernetes ServiceAccount for the PostgreSQL pods.
- `rbac`: Configuration for Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) resources.
- `psp`: Settings for Pod Security Policies.
- `networkPolicy`: Configuration for Kubernetes NetworkPolicy resources to control pod-to-pod communication.
- `tls`: Options for configuring TLS/SSL encryption for PostgreSQL connections.
- `audit`: Settings for PostgreSQL audit logging.
- `ldap`: Configuration options for LDAP authentication.

Each of these sections would contain multiple configuration parameters similar to those seen in the `primary` section, allowing for fine-grained control over various aspects of the PostgreSQL deployment.

The `values.yaml` file serves as a central configuration point for the Helm chart, allowing users to customize the PostgreSQL deployment to their specific needs by overriding these default values when installing or upgrading the chart.
