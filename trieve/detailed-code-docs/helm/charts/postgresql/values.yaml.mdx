Here's a high-level description of the `values.yaml` file for the PostgreSQL Helm chart:

## High-level description

This `values.yaml` file is a configuration file for deploying PostgreSQL using Helm. It contains a comprehensive set of parameters to customize the PostgreSQL deployment, including settings for authentication, replication, networking, resources, security, and more. The file is structured to allow for fine-grained control over both the primary PostgreSQL instance and any read replicas.

## Code Structure

The file is organized into several main sections:

1. Global parameters: These affect the entire deployment.
2. Common parameters: General Kubernetes-related settings.
3. PostgreSQL common parameters: Settings that apply to all PostgreSQL instances.
4. PostgreSQL Primary parameters: Specific settings for the primary PostgreSQL instance.
5. PostgreSQL read replica parameters: Settings for read replicas (when using replication).
6. Metrics parameters: Configuration for Prometheus metrics exporter.
7. Volume Permissions parameters: Settings for volume permissions initialization.
8. Other parameters: Miscellaneous settings like service bindings and RBAC.

Each section contains multiple configuration options, often with nested structures for more complex settings.

## Symbols

Some key symbols (configuration options) in this file include:

- `global`: Contains global settings that can override other sections.
- `image`: Specifies the PostgreSQL image to use.
- `auth`: Contains authentication-related settings.
- `primary`: Configures the primary PostgreSQL instance.
- `readReplicas`: Configures read replicas (if using replication).
- `metrics`: Settings for Prometheus metrics exporter.
- `persistence`: Configures persistent storage for PostgreSQL data.

These symbols are used to define various aspects of the PostgreSQL deployment, from basic configuration to advanced features like replication and monitoring.

## References

This file references several external components and concepts:

- Docker image registries and repositories
- Kubernetes concepts like PersistentVolumeClaims, SecurityContext, and NetworkPolicies
- PostgreSQL-specific concepts like replication and client authentication
- Prometheus for metrics collection
- LDAP for external authentication

Understanding these references is crucial for properly configuring and deploying PostgreSQL using this Helm chart.
