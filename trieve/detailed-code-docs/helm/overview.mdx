## High-level description
This directory contains Helm charts and templates for deploying and managing the Trieve application and its dependencies on Kubernetes. It includes configurations for the main Trieve components, as well as essential services like PostgreSQL, Redis, and Qdrant. The charts are designed to be flexible, allowing for deployment across different environments (local, AWS, Google Cloud) with customizable configurations.

## What does it do?
The Helm charts in this directory automate the deployment and configuration of a complex microservices-based application stack. Specifically, they:

1. Deploy core Trieve services including analytics, chat, search, and server components.
2. Set up supporting services such as Keycloak for authentication, ClickHouse for analytics, and Apache Tika for content analysis.
3. Configure networking through Services and Ingress rules to enable inter-service communication and external access.
4. Manage database deployments (PostgreSQL, Redis, Qdrant) with options for using subcharts or external instances.
5. Provide environment-specific configurations for local, AWS, and Google Cloud deployments.
6. Set up worker deployments for background tasks like file processing and data synchronization.
7. Define ConfigMaps and environment variables to configure application components.
8. Enable optional features like analytics, GPU usage, and unlimited usage based on configuration.

## Entry points
The main entry points for this Helm chart are:

1. `Chart.yaml`: Defines the chart metadata and dependencies.
2. `local-values.yaml`: Provides default configuration values for a local deployment.
3. `templates/ingress-*.yaml`: Define how external traffic reaches the services.
4. `templates/*-deployment.yaml`: Set up the core application components and their configurations.
5. `templates/*-service.yaml`: Expose the deployments within the cluster.

The control flow typically follows this pattern:
1. External requests come through the Ingress rules.
2. Requests are routed to appropriate Services.
3. Services direct traffic to the corresponding Deployments.
4. Deployments manage the pods running the application components.

## Key Files
1. `Chart.yaml`: Specifies chart metadata and dependencies on Redis, PostgreSQL, and Qdrant.
2. `local-values.yaml`: Contains comprehensive configuration settings for local deployment.
3. `templates/server-deployment.yaml`: Defines the main application server deployment.
4. `templates/clickhouse-deployment.yaml`: Sets up the ClickHouse database for analytics.
5. `templates/keycloak.yaml`: Configures Keycloak for authentication and user management.
6. `templates/*-worker-deployment.yaml`: Set up background processing tasks.
7. `charts/`: Contains subcharts for PostgreSQL, Qdrant, and Redis.

## Dependencies
The Helm charts rely on several external services and tools:

1. Kubernetes: The target platform for deployment (version 1.23+).
2. Helm: Used for templating and managing Kubernetes resources (v3).
3. Docker: Container images are used for all deployments.
4. PostgreSQL: Primary database (chart version 15.2.5).
5. Redis: Used for caching or as a message broker (chart version 18.9.0).
6. Qdrant: Vector database for similarity search (chart version 0.8.4).
7. Keycloak: Authentication and authorization.
8. ClickHouse: Analytics database.
9. Apache Tika: File parsing.
10. External APIs: OpenAI, Anthropic, Jina AI (for embeddings).
11. Cloud services: S3-compatible storage, SMTP (Gmail), Stripe for payments.

## Configuration
Configuration is primarily managed through Helm values, with key settings including:

1. `environment`: Determines the deployment environment (local, aws, gcloud).
2. `domain`: Sets the base domain for services.
3. `useGpu`: Flag to enable/disable GPU usage.
4. `containers`: Specifies container images and tags for various services.
5. `postgres`, `config.redis`, `config.qdrant`: Database configurations, including options to use subcharts.
6. `config.analytics`: Controls analytics features.
7. `config.trieve`: Trieve-specific settings, including unlimited usage and cookie security.
8. `config.oidc`: OpenID Connect configuration for authentication.
9. `config.smtp`: Email configuration settings.
10. `config.llm`, `config.openai`: Language model and OpenAI API configurations.
11. `config.s3`: S3 storage configuration.
12. `config.stripe`: Stripe payment configuration.
13. `embeddings`: Defines embedding models used in the application.

The templates make extensive use of environment variables to configure the application components, allowing for easy customization and secret management through Kubernetes mechanisms. The configuration options provide flexibility for deploying Trieve across different environments and with various optional features enabled or disabled as needed.
