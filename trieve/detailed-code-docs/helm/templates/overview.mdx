## High-level description
This directory contains Helm templates for deploying various components of a microservices-based application, including analytics, chat, search, server, and supporting services like Keycloak, ClickHouse, and Apache Tika. The templates define Kubernetes resources such as Deployments, Services, Ingress rules, and ConfigMaps, allowing for flexible and configurable deployment across different environments.

## What does it do?
These Helm templates collectively define the infrastructure and configuration for deploying a complex application stack. They:

1. Set up core application services (analytics, chat, search, server) with appropriate configurations and environment variables.
2. Configure networking through Services and Ingress rules to enable communication between components and external access.
3. Deploy supporting services like Keycloak for authentication, ClickHouse for analytics, and Apache Tika for content analysis.
4. Provide environment-specific configurations for local, AWS, and Google Cloud deployments.
5. Define worker deployments for background tasks such as file processing and data synchronization.
6. Set up necessary ConfigMaps and environment variables to configure the application components.

## Entry points
The main entry points for this Helm chart would typically be:

1. `ingress-*.yaml` files: Define how external traffic reaches the services.
2. `*-deployment.yaml` files: Set up the core application components and their configurations.
3. `*-service.yaml` files: Expose the deployments within the cluster.

The exact flow of control depends on the specific application architecture, but generally:
1. External requests come through the Ingress rules.
2. Requests are routed to appropriate Services.
3. Services direct traffic to the corresponding Deployments.
4. Deployments manage the pods running the application components.

## Key Files
1. `server-deployment.yaml`: Defines the main application server deployment.
2. `clickhouse-deplolyment.yaml`: Sets up the ClickHouse database for analytics.
3. `keycloak.yaml`: Configures Keycloak for authentication and user management.
4. `ingress-*.yaml` files: Define routing rules for different environments.
5. `*-worker-deployment.yaml` files: Set up background processing tasks.

## Dependencies
The templates rely on several external services and tools:

1. Kubernetes: The target platform for deployment.
2. Helm: Used for templating and managing the Kubernetes resources.
3. Docker: Container images are used for all deployments.
4. External services: Redis, PostgreSQL, S3-compatible storage, OpenAI API, Stripe, etc.
5. Cloud-specific services: Depends on the deployment environment (AWS, Google Cloud, or local).

## Configuration
Configuration is primarily managed through Helm values, with key settings including:

1. `.Values.environment`: Determines the deployment environment (local, aws, gcloud).
2. `.Values.domain`: Sets the base domain for services.
3. `.Values.containers.*`: Specifies container images and tags.
4. `.Values.config.*`: Configures various application settings, API keys, and service URLs.

Environment-specific configurations are often handled through conditional statements in the templates, allowing for flexible deployment across different infrastructures.

The templates make extensive use of environment variables to configure the application components, allowing for easy customization and secret management through Kubernetes mechanisms.
