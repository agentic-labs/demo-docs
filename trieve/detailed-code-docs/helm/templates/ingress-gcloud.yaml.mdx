title: "ingress-gcloud.yaml"

## High-level description
This Helm template file defines Kubernetes Ingress resources for a Google Cloud environment. It sets up routing rules for different services (dashboard, chat, server, and search) and includes network policies to allow all ingress and egress traffic.

## Code Structure
The file contains multiple Kubernetes resource definitions, including four Ingress resources and two NetworkPolicy resources. Each Ingress resource is associated with a specific service and domain, while the NetworkPolicy resources define broad access rules.

### Ingress Resources
#### Description
Four Ingress resources are defined for different services: dashboard, chat, server, and search. Each Ingress resource specifies routing rules for incoming HTTP traffic to the respective service.

#### Internal Logic
- Each Ingress resource is conditionally created based on the environment being "gcloud".
- The host for each Ingress is set using a subdomain of the `$domain` variable.
- All Ingress resources use the GCE ingress class.
- Each Ingress routes all traffic (`path: /`) to the corresponding service.

### NetworkPolicy Resources
#### Description
Two NetworkPolicy resources are defined to allow all ingress and egress traffic within the cluster.

#### Internal Logic
- `allow-all-ingress`: Allows all incoming traffic to any pod.
- `allow-all-egress`: Allows all outgoing traffic from any pod.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Kubernetes | The target platform for these resources |
| Google Cloud | The specific cloud provider for which these Ingress resources are configured |

### Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| .Values.environment | string | N/A | Determines if the resources should be created (must be "gcloud") |
| .Values.domain | string | N/A | The base domain for the Ingress hosts |

## Notes
1. The file uses Helm templating syntax, indicated by the `{{- }}` delimiters.
2. The entire template is wrapped in a conditional check `{{- if (eq .Values.environment "gcloud") }}`, ensuring these resources are only created in a Google Cloud environment.
3. The `$domain` variable is set at the beginning of the file and used throughout to construct the hostnames for each Ingress.
4. Each Ingress uses the `gce` ingress class, which is specific to Google Cloud.
5. The `external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/hostname` annotation suggests that external DNS might be used to automatically configure DNS records for these Ingress resources.
6. The NetworkPolicy resources are very permissive, allowing all traffic. This might not be suitable for production environments where more restrictive policies are typically recommended.
