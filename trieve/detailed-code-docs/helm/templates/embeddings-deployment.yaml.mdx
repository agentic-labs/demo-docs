title: "embeddings-deployment.yaml"
---

## High-level description
This Helm template generates Kubernetes Deployment manifests for embedding services. It iterates over a list of embedding services defined in the Helm values, creating a separate Deployment for each service with specific configurations based on the provided values.

## Code Structure
The template uses a range loop to iterate over `.Values.embeddings`, creating a Deployment for each embedding service. It extracts values for revision, model, name, and args from each service configuration and uses them to populate the Deployment specification.

### Deployment Template
#### Description
This template creates a Kubernetes Deployment for each embedding service defined in the Helm values.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| .Values.embeddings | List | List of embedding service configurations |
| .Values.environment | String | Deployment environment (e.g., "gcloud") |
| .Values.useGpu | Boolean | Flag to determine if GPU should be used |
| $.Release.Name | String | Helm release name |

#### Internal Logic
1. Iterates over each embedding service in `.Values.embeddings`.
2. Extracts revision, model, name, and args for each service.
3. Creates a Deployment with metadata and labels based on the service name and release.
4. Sets up a container with the appropriate image, args, and port.
5. Configures node selector for GCloud environment if applicable.
6. Adds GPU resources if `useGpu` is true.
7. Sets up a readiness probe for the container.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Kubernetes | The template generates Kubernetes Deployment manifests |
| Helm | The template uses Helm templating syntax and values |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| useGpu | Boolean | N/A | Determines whether to use GPU resources |
| environment | String | N/A | Specifies the deployment environment |

## Performance Considerations
The template includes conditional logic for GPU usage, which can significantly affect the performance and resource allocation of the deployed embedding services. When `useGpu` is true, the Deployment is configured to use NVIDIA GPUs, which can greatly accelerate embedding computations but also requires specific node selection in cloud environments like GCloud.
