title: "groupworker-deployment.yaml"
---

## High-level description
This code defines a Kubernetes Deployment for a "group-worker" application. It specifies the container image, environment variables, resource limits, and other configuration options for the deployment. The deployment ensures that a specified number of replicas (in this case, 1) of the group-worker application are running at all times.

## Code Structure
The code defines a Kubernetes Deployment object with specifications for selecting pods, defining a template for creating pods, and configuring containers within those pods. The container specification includes the image to use, environment variables to set, and optional sidecar containers for specific environments.

## Symbols

### `group-worker` Deployment
#### Description
This deployment manages the deployment of the "group-worker" application, which likely handles background tasks related to grouping data. It specifies a single replica, meaning only one instance of the application will be running at a time.

#### Inputs
This deployment takes inputs from a Helm chart's values file, including:
* `.Release.Name`: The name of the Helm release.
* `.Values.environment`: The environment the application is deploying to (e.g., "local", "gcloud").
* `.Values.containers.group_worker.tag`: The Docker tag for the group-worker image.
* `.Values.config.*`: Various configuration options for the application, including API keys, database connection strings, and other settings.

#### Outputs
This deployment creates a single-replica deployment in the Kubernetes cluster, running the specified group-worker container image with the provided configuration.

#### Internal Logic
The deployment uses a ternary operator to determine the image repository based on the environment. It also conditionally includes a sidecar container for Cloud SQL Proxy if the environment is "gcloud".

## Side Effects
This deployment creates Kubernetes resources (Deployment, ReplicaSet, Pods) and configures them according to the provided specifications. It also potentially pulls container images from a registry.

## Dependencies
This deployment depends on the following:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Kubernetes API server | To create and manage the deployment and its associated resources. |
| Container registry | To pull the specified container images. |
| Various services (Redis, Qdrant, PostgreSQL, etc.) | The application running in the container depends on these services, as indicated by the environment variables. |

## Configuration
The deployment is configured through various values passed from a Helm chart, including:
* Image tag for the group-worker container.
* Environment-specific settings (e.g., database connection strings).
* Application-specific configuration options (API keys, service URLs, etc.).

## Error Handling
This deployment does not implement specific error handling mechanisms within the YAML itself. Error handling is expected to be handled within the application code running in the container.

## Logging
This deployment does not explicitly define logging mechanisms. Logging is expected to be handled within the application code running in the container.
