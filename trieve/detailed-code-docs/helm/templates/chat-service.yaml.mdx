title: "chat-service.yaml"
---

## High-level description
This code defines a Kubernetes Service named "chat-service" that exposes a deployment named "chat" on port 80 within the cluster. It uses a ClusterIP, making the service accessible only from within the Kubernetes cluster.

## Code Structure
This code defines a single Kubernetes Service resource. It uses Helm templating to dynamically generate values for names and selectors based on the release name.

## Symbols
### `chat-service`
#### Description
This symbol defines a Kubernetes Service resource that exposes a deployment named "chat" on port 80 within the cluster.

#### Inputs
This code block doesn't have explicit input parameters. It uses values from the Helm context, such as:
* `.Release.Name`: The name of the Helm release.

#### Outputs
This code defines a Kubernetes Service resource with the following specifications:
* `name`: {{ $name }} (defaults to "chat-service")
* `labels`: Includes labels for the application name and instance.
* `spec.type`: ClusterIP (accessible only within the cluster)
* `spec.ports`: Defines a single port mapping:
    * `port`: 80
    * `targetPort`: 80
    * `protocol`: TCP
    * `name`: chat
* `spec.selector`: Used to select pods belonging to the "chat" deployment with the current release name.

#### Internal Logic
The code uses Helm templating to dynamically generate values for names and selectors based on the release name. It defines a Service resource with a ClusterIP, making it accessible only from within the Kubernetes cluster. The service targets pods with specific labels, ensuring traffic is routed to the correct deployment.

## Dependencies
This code depends on Kubernetes and Helm.

* **Kubernetes:**  This code defines a Kubernetes Service resource, relying on the Kubernetes API for deployment and management.
* **Helm:** This code uses Helm templating syntax (e.g., `{{ .Release.Name }}`) for dynamic value generation.

## Configuration
This code doesn't define any specific configuration options. The service name, port, and target port are hardcoded, while the selectors are dynamically generated based on the Helm release name.
