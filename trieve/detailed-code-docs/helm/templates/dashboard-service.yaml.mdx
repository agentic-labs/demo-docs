### Service Definition
#### Description
This YAML defines a Kubernetes Service resource named "dashboard-service". It's designed to provide network access to a set of pods running the dashboard application within the cluster.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up variables for name and selector.
2. Defines the Service resource with metadata and specifications.
3. Configures the service type as ClusterIP for internal cluster access.
4. Specifies port mapping and protocol for incoming traffic.
5. Sets up selector labels to identify the target pods.

### Variables
#### `$name`
- **Value**: "dashboard-service"
- **Usage**: Used as the name of the Service and in labels.

#### `$selector`
- **Value**: "dashboard"
- **Usage**: Used in the selector to identify target pods.

### Metadata
#### Description
Defines the name and labels for the Service resource.

| Field | Value | Description |
|:------|:------|:------------|
| name | {{ $name }} | Sets the name of the Service to "dashboard-service" |
| labels.app.kubernetes.io/name | {{ $name }} | Adds a label with the service name |

### Spec
#### Description
Specifies the Service configuration, including type, ports, and selector.

| Field | Value | Description |
|:------|:------|:------------|
| type | ClusterIP | Exposes the Service on an internal IP in the cluster |
| ports.port | 80 | The port on which the Service is exposed |
| ports.targetPort | 80 | The port on the pod to which traffic is sent |
| ports.protocol | TCP | The network protocol used |
| ports.name | dashboard | A name for this port definition |
| selector.app.kubernetes.io/name | {{ $selector }} | Selects pods with the label "dashboard" |
| selector.app.kubernetes.io/instance | {{ .Release.Name }} | Selects pods from the current Helm release |

## Dependencies
This YAML file is a Helm template, indicated by the use of template variables (e.g., `{{ $name }}`). It relies on Helm for variable substitution and template rendering.

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Helm | Template rendering and variable substitution |

## Configuration
The configuration of this Service is partly determined by Helm variables:

| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| .Release.Name | string | The name of the Helm release, used in pod selector |

This allows for flexibility in deployment, as the actual values will be provided when the Helm chart is installed or upgraded.
