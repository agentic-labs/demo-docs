title: "ingress-aws.yaml"

## High-level description
This Helm template file defines Kubernetes Ingress resources for an AWS environment. It sets up routing rules for various services (dashboard, chat, server, and search) and includes network policies to allow all ingress and egress traffic.

## Code Structure
The file contains multiple Kubernetes resource definitions, including five Ingress resources and two NetworkPolicy resources. Each Ingress resource is configured for a specific service, and the NetworkPolicy resources are set to allow all ingress and egress traffic.

### Ingress Resources
#### Description
These Kubernetes Ingress resources define how external HTTP and HTTPS traffic should be routed to the services within the cluster.

#### Internal Logic
Each Ingress resource is configured with:
- Metadata: Including name, labels, and annotations for ALB (Application Load Balancer) configuration
- Spec: Defining the ingress class and routing rules based on the host and path

The following Ingress resources are defined:
1. ingress-dashboard
2. ingress-chat
3. ingress-server
4. ingress-search

Each Ingress is configured to use the ALB ingress class and is set up for internet-facing access.

### NetworkPolicy Resources
#### Description
These Kubernetes NetworkPolicy resources define the network traffic rules for the cluster.

#### Internal Logic
Two NetworkPolicy resources are defined:
1. allow-all-ingress: Allows all incoming traffic to any pod in the cluster
2. allow-all-egress: Allows all outgoing traffic from any pod in the cluster

These policies effectively disable network isolation within the cluster.

## Dependencies
This template relies on Helm for variable substitution and conditional rendering.

### Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| .Values.environment | string | N/A | Determines if the resources should be created (must be "aws") |
| .Values.domain | string | N/A | The domain name used for constructing hostnames |

## Notes
- The entire template is wrapped in a conditional check `{{- if (eq .Values.environment "aws") }}`, ensuring these resources are only created in an AWS environment.
- The `$domain` variable is set at the beginning of the file using `.Values.domain` and is used throughout the template to construct hostnames.
- Each Ingress resource uses annotations specific to AWS ALB Ingress Controller.
- The server Ingress includes a health check configuration pointing to "/api/health" on port 8090.
- The NetworkPolicy resources effectively allow all network traffic, which might not be suitable for production environments requiring stricter security controls.
