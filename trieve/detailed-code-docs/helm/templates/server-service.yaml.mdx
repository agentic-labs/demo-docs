## High-level description
This Helm template defines a Kubernetes Service for a server application. It also includes a Google Cloud-specific BackendConfig for health checks when deployed in a Google Cloud environment. The template uses variables and conditional statements to customize the configuration based on the deployment environment.

## Code Structure
The template is divided into two main parts:
1. A conditional BackendConfig resource for Google Cloud deployments.
2. A Kubernetes Service resource for exposing the server application.

## Symbols

### BackendConfig (Google Cloud specific)
#### Description
Defines a Google Cloud BackendConfig resource for configuring health checks on the server service. This is only included when the deployment environment is set to "gcloud".

#### Internal Logic
- Checks if the environment is "gcloud" using a conditional statement.
- If true, creates a BackendConfig resource with specific health check settings.

### Service
#### Description
Defines a Kubernetes Service resource to expose the server application within the cluster.

#### Internal Logic
- Uses variables `$name` and `$selector` for consistent naming and selection.
- Sets metadata including name, annotations, and labels.
- Configures the service type as ClusterIP.
- Defines a port configuration for the server.
- Sets up a selector to target the appropriate server pods.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Helm | Template rendering and variable substitution |
| Kubernetes | Service resource definition |
| Google Cloud (conditional) | BackendConfig resource for GCP deployments |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| environment | string | N/A | Determines whether to include GCP-specific configurations |
| Release.Name | string | N/A | Used in the selector to identify the correct instance |

## API/Interface Reference
| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| /api/health | GET | N/A | N/A | Health check endpoint for the server service |

This template defines a Kubernetes Service that exposes port 8090 for the server application. When deployed in a Google Cloud environment, it also includes a BackendConfig for health checks. The Service uses ClusterIP type, making it internally accessible within the Kubernetes cluster. The health check, when applicable, is configured to check the `/api/health` endpoint every 15 seconds.
