## High-level description
This YAML file defines a Kubernetes Deployment for an analytics application. It specifies the deployment configuration, including container image, port, and environment variables, using Helm templating for dynamic value insertion.

### Deployment
#### Description
This Kubernetes Deployment resource defines how to deploy and manage the analytics application.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets metadata for the deployment, including name and labels.
2. Defines a selector to match pods managed by this deployment.
3. Specifies the pod template, including labels and container specifications.
4. Configures a single container named "analytics" with:
   - Dynamic image selection based on environment
   - Exposed port 80
   - Environment variables for API host and dashboard URL

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Kubernetes | For deploying and managing the application |
| Helm | For templating and value substitution |

### Configuration
| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| .Release.Name | string | Helm release name, used in labels |
| .Values.environment | string | Environment setting, affects image repository |
| .Values.containers.analytics.tag | string | Tag for the analytics container image |
| .Values.config.vite.apiHost | string | API host for the VITE_API_HOST environment variable |
| .Values.config.vite.dashboardUrl | string | Dashboard URL for the VITE_DASHBOARD_URL environment variable |

## Notes
1. The image repository is dynamically set based on the environment:
   - If not "local", it uses "trieve/"
   - If "local", it uses "localhost:5001/"
2. The full image name is constructed using the repository, "analytics-site", and the specified tag.
3. The deployment uses app.kubernetes.io/name and app.kubernetes.io/instance labels for identification and selection.
4. The container exposes port 80, suggesting it might be serving web content.
5. Two environment variables (VITE_API_HOST and VITE_DASHBOARD_URL) are set, indicating this might be a Vite-based application.

This deployment configuration allows for flexible deployment across different environments while maintaining consistent labeling and selection criteria.
