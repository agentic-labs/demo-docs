title: "fileworker-deployment.yaml"
---

## High-level description
This code defines a Kubernetes Deployment for a "file-worker" application. It specifies the container image, environment variables, resource limits, and other configuration options for the deployment. The deployment is managed by Helm and includes logic for different environments (local, gcloud).

## Code Structure
The code defines a Kubernetes Deployment resource using a YAML configuration file. It includes specifications for metadata, selectors, templates, containers, and environment variables. The template section defines labels and specifications for the pod, including service account, containers, and their configurations.

## References
This code references values from a `values.yaml` file, which is a common practice in Helm charts. These values are used to configure various aspects of the deployment, such as container image tag, environment variables, and resource limits.

## Symbols
### `file-worker` Deployment
#### Description
This deployment defines a Kubernetes Deployment named "file-worker". It's responsible for deploying the "file-worker" application, which likely handles file processing tasks within the Trieve system.

#### Inputs
This deployment doesn't take direct inputs. It relies on values provided through a `values.yaml` file during deployment.

#### Outputs
This deployment creates a Deployment resource in the Kubernetes cluster, which in turn manages the lifecycle of the "file-worker" pods.

#### Internal Logic
The deployment utilizes conditional logic based on the `environment` value to apply specific configurations. For instance, if the environment is "gcloud", it sets up a service account and a sidecar container for Cloud SQL Proxy.

#### Side Effects
- Creates a Deployment in the Kubernetes cluster.
- Pulls the specified container image from the registry.
- Creates pods based on the deployment specification.

## Dependencies
This code depends on the following:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Kubernetes API | Defines the Deployment resource and its configuration options. |
| Helm | Provides templating and deployment capabilities for the deployment. |

### Configuration
The deployment relies on values provided through a `values.yaml` file. These values configure various aspects of the deployment, including:
- Container image tag
- Environment variables for various services and configurations
- Resource limits for the container
- Service account for the pod (in specific environments)

## Error Handling
The code doesn't implement specific error handling mechanisms. It relies on Kubernetes' built-in mechanisms for handling pod and container failures.

## Logging
The code doesn't explicitly define logging mechanisms. It likely relies on the logging configurations of the "file-worker" application itself.
