title: "tika-service.yaml"
---

## High-level description
This YAML file defines a Kubernetes Service resource for a Tika application. It exposes the Tika service within the cluster, allowing other components to communicate with it using a stable internal IP address and port.

## Symbols

### Service
#### Description
This Kubernetes Service resource named "tika" is designed to provide network access to Tika pods within the cluster. It uses the ClusterIP type, which means it's only accessible within the cluster.

#### Internal Logic
The Service selects pods with specific labels and forwards traffic to them on a specified port.

1. **Metadata**: 
   - Name: "tika"
   - Label: app.kubernetes.io/name: tika

2. **Spec**:
   - Type: ClusterIP (internal cluster access only)
   - Port configuration:
     - Port: 9998 (the port on which the Service is exposed)
     - TargetPort: 9998 (the port on the pod to which traffic is forwarded)
     - Protocol: TCP
     - Name: tika
   - Selector:
     - app.kubernetes.io/name: tika (uses a variable `$selector`)
     - app.kubernetes.io/instance: trieve

## Dependencies
This YAML file is a Kubernetes resource definition and depends on the Kubernetes API server to process and apply it.

## Configuration
The configuration is defined inline within the YAML structure. Key configurations include:

| Option | Type | Value | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------|:------------|
| metadata.name | string | tika | The name of the Service |
| spec.type | string | ClusterIP | The type of Service (internal cluster access) |
| spec.ports[0].port | integer | 9998 | The port on which the Service is exposed |
| spec.ports[0].targetPort | integer | 9998 | The port on the pod to which traffic is forwarded |
| spec.selector | map | app.kubernetes.io/name: tika, app.kubernetes.io/instance: trieve | Labels used to select pods that this Service will route traffic to |

## Notes
1. The file uses a Helm template variable `$selector` to set the value for the `app.kubernetes.io/name` selector. This allows for potential customization of the selector when rendering the template.
2. The Service is configured to work with Tika pods running on port 9998, which is likely the default port for Tika server.
3. The `app.kubernetes.io/instance: trieve` label in the selector suggests that this Service is part of a larger application or deployment named "trieve".
