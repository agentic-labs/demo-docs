## High-level description
This Kubernetes Deployment manifest defines the configuration for deploying the server component of the Trieve application. It specifies container settings, environment variables, and resource requirements for the server, as well as additional configurations for cloud deployments.

## Code Structure
The manifest is structured as a Kubernetes Deployment resource, containing metadata, selector, and template specifications. The template defines the pod configuration, including containers, environment variables, and optional cloud-specific settings.

### Deployment
#### Description
Defines a Kubernetes Deployment for the server component of the Trieve application.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up metadata and labels for the deployment
2. Defines selector for pod matching
3. Specifies pod template with container configurations
4. Configures environment variables for the server container
5. Adds cloud-specific configurations when deployed in Google Cloud

## Configuration
The deployment configuration includes numerous environment variables that control various aspects of the server's behavior and connections to external services. Key configurations include:

| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| SENTRY_URL | string | URL for Sentry error tracking |
| ADMIN_API_KEY | string | API key for admin access |
| BASE_SERVER_URL | string | Base URL for the server |
| REDIS_URL | string | Connection URL for Redis |
| QDRANT_URL | string | URL for Qdrant vector database |
| DATABASE_URL | string | Connection URL for PostgreSQL database |
| OPENAI_API_KEY | string | API key for OpenAI services |
| S3_ENDPOINT | string | Endpoint for S3 storage |
| STRIPE_SECRET | string | Secret key for Stripe integration |
| OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET | string | Client secret for OpenID Connect |
| GPU_SERVER_ORIGIN | string | Origin for GPU server |
| EMBEDDING_SERVER_ORIGIN | string | Origin for embedding server |
| CLICKHOUSE_URL | string | URL for ClickHouse analytics database |

## Dependencies
The deployment relies on several external services and components:

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Redis | Caching and temporary data storage |
| Qdrant | Vector database for similarity search |
| PostgreSQL | Primary relational database |
| S3 | Object storage |
| OpenAI | AI services |
| Stripe | Payment processing |
| ClickHouse | Analytics database |

## Error Handling
The deployment includes Sentry integration for error tracking, configured through the `SENTRY_URL` environment variable.

## Performance Considerations
1. The server container requests 1 CPU unit.
2. For Google Cloud deployments, a Cloud SQL Proxy is included with specific resource requests (2Gi memory, 1 CPU).
3. The deployment uses environment variables to configure connection details for various services, allowing for flexible scaling and management of external dependencies.

## API/Interface Reference
The server exposes port 8090, which is likely the main API endpoint for the Trieve application.

## Notes
1. The deployment includes conditional logic for Google Cloud deployments, adding a Cloud SQL Proxy container and using a specific service account.
2. The image used for the server container is determined dynamically based on the deployment environment (local vs. non-local).
3. Many configuration options are parameterized using Helm templating, allowing for easy customization across different environments.
