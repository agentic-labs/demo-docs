title: "keycloak-realm-configmap.yaml"
---

## High-level description
This file defines a Kubernetes ConfigMap named `keycloak-realm-export` that contains the configuration of a Keycloak realm named "trieve". This configuration includes details about authentication flows, clients, roles, identity providers, and other realm settings.

## References
This code references various Keycloak concepts and settings, such as:
- Realm: A Keycloak realm represents a logical unit that isolates users, applications, and roles.
- Client: A client is an application that interacts with Keycloak for authentication and authorization.
- Role: A role defines a set of permissions that can be assigned to users or clients.
- Identity Provider: An identity provider is an external system that Keycloak can use to authenticate users.

## Symbols
### `keycloak-realm-export`
#### Description
This symbol defines a Kubernetes ConfigMap that stores the exported configuration of a Keycloak realm. This ConfigMap can be used to import the realm configuration into a Keycloak instance.

#### Inputs
This symbol does not take any explicit inputs.

#### Outputs
This symbol does not produce any explicit outputs.

#### Internal Logic
The ConfigMap contains a single data entry named `realm-export.json`, which holds a JSON object representing the Keycloak realm configuration. The JSON object includes various settings and configurations for the realm, such as:

- Realm settings: General settings for the realm, like session timeouts, SSL requirements, and registration options.
- Roles: Definitions of realm and client roles, including their names, descriptions, and associated permissions.
- Groups: Definitions of user groups within the realm.
- Clients: Configurations for clients that interact with the realm, including their redirect URIs, web origins, and allowed scopes.
- Client Scopes: Definitions of client scopes that group together related permissions.
- Identity Providers: Configurations for external identity providers, such as Google and GitHub.
- Authentication Flows: Definitions of authentication flows that determine how users authenticate to the realm.
- Required Actions: Configurations for required actions that users need to perform, such as verifying their email address.

## Side Effects
This ConfigMap, when applied to a Kubernetes cluster, creates a new ConfigMap object that can be consumed by other Kubernetes resources, such as Keycloak deployments.

## Dependencies
This code depends on Kubernetes APIs for defining ConfigMaps.

## Configuration
This code does not define any specific configuration options. The configuration is provided within the `realm-export.json` data entry.
