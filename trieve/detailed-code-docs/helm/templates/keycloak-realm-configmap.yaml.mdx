## High-level description
This file contains a Kubernetes ConfigMap definition for a Keycloak realm export. It defines the configuration for a Keycloak realm named "trieve", including authentication settings, client configurations, user roles, and identity providers.

## Code Structure
The file consists of a single Kubernetes ConfigMap resource. The main content is in the `data` field, which contains a JSON structure defining the Keycloak realm configuration.

### ConfigMap
#### Description
This Kubernetes ConfigMap is used to store the Keycloak realm configuration as a JSON string. It allows for easy deployment and management of the Keycloak realm settings within a Kubernetes environment.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| metadata.name | string | The name of the ConfigMap: "keycloak-realm-export" |
| data.realm-export.json | string | JSON string containing the Keycloak realm configuration |

#### Internal Logic
The ConfigMap stores the entire Keycloak realm configuration as a single JSON string in the `realm-export.json` key. This configuration includes:

1. Realm settings (ID, name, access token lifespans, etc.)
2. Role definitions (realm roles and client roles)
3. Client configurations
4. Authentication flows
5. Identity provider settings
6. Required actions
7. Client scopes
8. Protocol mappers

## Dependencies
This ConfigMap is likely used in conjunction with a Keycloak deployment in a Kubernetes environment. It depends on the Keycloak server to interpret and apply the realm configuration.

## Configuration
The main configuration is the Keycloak realm itself, defined in the `realm-export.json` data. Key configuration points include:

1. Realm name: "trieve"
2. Enabled identity providers: Google and GitHub
3. Client configurations, including a client named "trieve"
4. Various token lifespans and security settings
5. Role definitions and default roles
6. Authentication flows and required actions

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this ConfigMap. Error handling would be managed by the Keycloak server when it attempts to import this realm configuration.

## API/Interface Reference
This ConfigMap doesn't expose an API directly. It's consumed by Keycloak to configure a realm. The structure of the JSON data corresponds to Keycloak's realm export format.
