## High-level description
This YAML file defines a Kubernetes Deployment for a search application. It specifies the deployment configuration, including container image, ports, and environment variables for the search service.

## Symbols

### Deployment
#### Description
This Kubernetes resource defines a Deployment named "search" that manages the search application pods.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets metadata for the deployment, including name and labels.
2. Defines a selector to match pods with specific labels.
3. Specifies the pod template with container configuration.
4. Configures a single container named "search" with image, port, and environment variables.

### Container Configuration
#### Description
Defines the container specifications for the search application.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the container name to "search".
2. Determines the image based on the environment:
   - For non-local environments: `trieve/search:&lt;tag&gt;`
   - For local environment: `localhost:5001/search:&lt;tag&gt;`
3. Exposes port 80 for the container.
4. Sets environment variables for the application.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Helm | Template rendering (implied by the use of `{{ }}` syntax) |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| `.Release.Name` | string | Helm release name, used in labels |
| `.Values.environment` | string | Environment setting (e.g., "local" or other) |
| `.Values.containers.search.tag` | string | Tag for the search container image |
| `.Values.config.vite.apiHost` | string | API host configuration for Vite |
| `.Values.config.vite.searchUiUrl` | string | Search UI URL configuration for Vite |
| `.Values.config.vite.dashboardUrl` | string | Dashboard URL configuration for Vite |

## Notes
1. The image repository is determined dynamically based on the environment:
   - If not local, it uses "trieve/" as the prefix.
   - If local, it uses "localhost:5001/" as the prefix.
2. The deployment uses app.kubernetes.io/name and app.kubernetes.io/instance labels for consistency.
3. The container exposes port 80, suggesting it might be running a web server.
4. Environment variables are set for Vite configuration, indicating this might be a frontend application.
