## High-level description
This YAML file defines a Kubernetes Service resource for an analytics service. It creates a ClusterIP service that routes traffic to pods labeled with the "analytics" selector, exposing port 80 for internal cluster communication.

### Service Definition
#### Description
This YAML defines a Kubernetes Service resource named "analytics-service". It uses ClusterIP type to expose the service internally within the cluster and routes traffic to pods labeled with "analytics".

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up variables:
   - `$name`: "analytics-service"
   - `$selector`: "analytics"
2. Defines the Service resource:
   - `kind`: Service
   - `apiVersion`: v1
3. Configures metadata:
   - `name`: Uses the `$name` variable
   - `labels`: Sets an app.kubernetes.io/name label with the `$name` value
4. Specifies the service:
   - `type`: ClusterIP (for internal cluster access)
   - `ports`: Defines a single port configuration
     - `port`: 80 (the port on which the service is exposed)
     - `targetPort`: 80 (the port on the pod to which traffic is forwarded)
     - `protocol`: TCP
     - `name`: analytics
   - `selector`: Defines labels to select the target pods
     - `app.kubernetes.io/name`: Uses the `$selector` variable ("analytics")
     - `app.kubernetes.io/instance`: "trieve"

## Dependencies
This YAML file is a Helm template, as indicated by the use of Go template syntax ({{ }}). It relies on Helm for variable substitution and template rendering.

## Configuration
The configuration is mostly hardcoded within the YAML, with two variables defined at the top:
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| $name | string | "analytics-service" | The name of the service |
| $selector | string | "analytics" | The selector used to target pods |

These variables are used in the metadata and selector fields, allowing for potential customization if needed in the future.

## Notes
1. The service uses ClusterIP, which means it's only accessible within the Kubernetes cluster.
2. The service forwards traffic from port 80 to port 80 on the selected pods.
3. The selector targets pods with labels `app.kubernetes.io/name: analytics` and `app.kubernetes.io/instance: trieve`.
4. This template is likely part of a larger Helm chart for deploying an analytics application.
