Here's a comprehensive documentation for the provided Kubernetes Deployment YAML file:

## High-level description
This YAML file defines a Kubernetes Deployment for a delete worker in a Trieve application. It sets up the necessary configuration for deploying and running the delete worker container, including environment variables, service account, and container specifications.

## Code Structure
The YAML file defines a single Kubernetes Deployment resource with various nested fields for configuring the deployment, pod template, and container specifications.

## Symbols

#### Description
Defines a Kubernetes Deployment for the delete worker.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| metadata | Object | Metadata for the deployment |
| spec | Object | Specification for the deployment |

#### Internal Logic
- Sets up labels for the deployment
- Defines the selector for matching pods
- Configures the pod template with labels, service account, and container specifications

### Container Specification
#### Description
Defines the container configuration for the delete worker.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| name | String | Name of the container |
| image | String | Docker image for the container |
| env | Array | Environment variables for the container |

#### Internal Logic

## Side Effects
The deployment may create and manage pods running the delete worker container, which could interact with various external services and resources based on the provided configuration.

## Performance Considerations
The deployment does not specify resource limits or requests, which could affect performance and resource allocation in the cluster.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the provided YAML.

This deployment YAML is part of a larger Helm chart for deploying a Trieve application, with the delete worker being one component of the overall system. It's designed to be configurable through Helm values and integrates with various services like Redis, Qdrant, PostgreSQL, and cloud services.
