title: "clustering-cronjob.yaml"
---

## High-level description
This YAML file defines a Kubernetes CronJob named "clustering-cronjob" that runs a clustering task on an hourly basis. The job uses a custom Docker image to perform clickhouse clustering operations, likely involving data processing or analysis tasks.

## Symbols

### CronJob
#### Description
The CronJob resource schedules a job to run periodically according to a specified schedule. In this case, it's configured to run a clustering task every hour.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| schedule | string | Cron expression defining when the job should run |
| jobTemplate | object | Template for the job to be created |

#### Internal Logic
The CronJob is set to run every hour (at the start of each hour) using the cron schedule "0 * * * *". When triggered, it creates a new Pod based on the defined template.

### Pod Template
#### Description
Defines the specification for the Pod that will be created by the CronJob.

#### Internal Logic
The Pod runs a single container named "clustering-task" using the "trieve/clickhouse-clustering:latest" image. It sets two environment variables:
1. ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: Sourced from the Helm values
2. CLICKHOUSE_DSN: Sourced from the Helm values

The restart policy is set to "OnFailure", meaning the Pod will be restarted if it fails to complete successfully.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| trieve/clickhouse-clustering:latest | Docker image containing the clustering task logic |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| .Values.config.trieve.anthropicAPIKey | string | N/A | API key for Anthropic services |
| .Values.config.trieve.clickhouseDSN | string | N/A | DSN for connecting to ClickHouse database |

Note: The actual values for these configurations are not present in this file and would be provided separately in the Helm values file.

## Performance Considerations
The CronJob is scheduled to run every hour, which could impact system resources depending on the complexity and duration of the clustering task. It's important to monitor the job's performance and adjust the schedule if necessary to balance data freshness with system load.
