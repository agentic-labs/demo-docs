title: "Chart.yaml"

## High-level description
This Chart.yaml file defines a Helm chart for the Trieve application. It specifies the chart's metadata and declares dependencies on Redis, PostgreSQL, and Qdrant, which can be optionally included as subcharts based on configuration conditions.

### Chart Metadata
#### Description
The top-level fields in the YAML file define the basic metadata for the Helm chart.

| Name | Value | Description |
|:-----|:------|:------------|
| apiVersion | v2 | Specifies the version of the Chart.yaml schema |
| name | trieve | The name of the Helm chart |
| description | Helm chart expressing Trieve deployment and dependencies | A brief description of the chart's purpose |
| type | application | Indicates that this chart is for an application |
| version | 0.1.0 | The version of the chart itself |
| appVersion | "1.16.0" | The version of the application being deployed |

### Dependencies
#### Description
The `dependencies` section lists other Helm charts that this chart depends on. Each dependency is conditionally included based on a specified condition.

| Dependency | Repository | Version | Condition |
|:-----------|:-----------|:--------|:----------|
| redis | https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami | 18.9.0 | config.redis.useSubchart |
| postgresql | https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami | 15.2.5 | postgres.useSubchart |
| qdrant | https://qdrant.github.io/qdrant-helm | 0.8.4 | config.qdrant.useSubchart |

#### Internal Logic
The inclusion of each dependency is controlled by a condition. This allows for flexible deployment configurations where these services can either be included as subcharts or provided externally.

## Configuration
The chart uses conditions to determine whether to include subcharts. These conditions are likely defined in a separate values file:

| Option | Description |
|:-------|:------------|
| config.redis.useSubchart | Controls whether to include the Redis subchart |
| postgres.useSubchart | Controls whether to include the PostgreSQL subchart |
| config.qdrant.useSubchart | Controls whether to include the Qdrant subchart |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Redis | Likely used for caching or as a message broker |
| PostgreSQL | Probably serves as the primary database for the application |
| Qdrant | A vector database, possibly used for similarity search or other vector operations |

Note: The exact usage of these dependencies would depend on the specifics of the Trieve application, which are not provided in this Chart.yaml file.
