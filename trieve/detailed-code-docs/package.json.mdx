## Configuration
This `package.json` file serves as the root configuration for the entire monorepo. It uses Yarn workspaces to manage multiple packages within the repository and Turborepo for optimizing the build and development processes.

The configuration enables developers to run commands across all workspaces simultaneously, such as starting development servers, building, and linting. This setup promotes code sharing and consistency across the various frontend applications and client libraries within the project.
