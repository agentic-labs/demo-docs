## High-level description
The `Navbar` component is a React component that renders a navigation bar for a chat application. It provides functionality for displaying and editing the current topic name, toggling the sidebar, and creating new topics. The component is designed to be responsive, with different layouts for mobile and desktop views.

## Code Structure
The `Navbar` component is defined as a function that takes `NavbarProps` as its input. It uses various Solid.js primitives like `createSignal`, `createEffect`, and `Show` to manage state and conditional rendering. The component interacts with the `UserContext` to access user-related data and makes API calls to update topic information.
