## High-level description
The `Navbar` component is a React component that renders a navigation bar for a chat application. It provides functionality for displaying and editing the current topic name, as well as creating new topics. The component is responsive and adapts its layout for mobile and desktop views.

## Code Structure
The `Navbar` component is defined as a function that takes `NavbarProps` as its input. It uses various Solid.js primitives like `createSignal`, `createEffect`, and `useContext` to manage state and side effects. The component renders different UI elements based on the current state and props.

## References
- `UserContext`: Used to access the current user's dataset information.
- `Topic`: Imported from `../../utils/apiTypes`, representing the structure of a chat topic.
