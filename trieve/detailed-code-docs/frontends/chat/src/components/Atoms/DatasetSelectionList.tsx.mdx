## High-level description
The `DatasetSelectionList` component is a reusable React component that renders a list of selectable datasets. It allows users to choose a dataset from the provided list and updates the current dataset in the user context when selected.

## Code Structure
The main component `DatasetSelectionList` uses the `UserContext` to access and update the current dataset. It renders a list of `MenuItem` components for each dataset, with a checkmark icon for the currently selected dataset.

### DatasetSelectionList
#### Description
A functional component that renders a list of selectable datasets.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| onSelect | () =&gt; void | Callback function to be called when a dataset is selected |
| datasets | DatasetAndUsageDTO[] | Array of dataset objects to be displayed in the list |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the current user context using `useContext(UserContext)`.
2. Maps through the first 500 datasets in the `datasets` prop.
3. For each dataset, renders a `MenuItem` component with the dataset name.
4. Applies conditional styling to highlight the currently selected dataset.
5. Adds a checkmark icon for the currently selected dataset.
6. Handles click events on dataset items, updating the current dataset in the user context and calling the `onSelect` callback.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| solid-js | For using Solid.js features like `For`, `Show`, and `useContext` |
| terracotta | For using the `MenuItem` component |
| solid-icons/fa | For using the `FaSolidCheck` icon |

## Performance Considerations
The component limits the number of displayed datasets to 500 using `slice(0, 500)`, which helps prevent rendering an excessive number of items and potential performance issues with very large dataset lists.
