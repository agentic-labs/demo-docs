## High-level description
The `frontends/chat/src/components/Atoms` directory houses a collection of reusable React components that serve as the building blocks for the chat interface. These components are self-contained and focus on specific UI elements or functionalities, promoting code reusability and maintainability within the larger application.

## What does it do?
This directory provides a library of basic UI components used throughout the chat frontend. These components range from simple elements like a logo to more complex ones like modal dialogs and dataset selection dropdowns. They handle user interaction, data display, and styling for their respective functionalities.

## Key Files

### AfMessage.tsx
This component renders individual messages within the chat interface. It supports different message roles (user, assistant, system), allows for message editing, and displays metadata and citations for assistant messages. It utilizes SolidJS for its reactive programming model and leverages external libraries for markdown rendering and UI elements.

### DatasetSelectBox.tsx and DatasetSelectionList.tsx
These components work together to provide a dropdown menu for selecting datasets. `DatasetSelectBox` handles the overall dropdown functionality, including search and display, while `DatasetSelectionList` renders the list of selectable datasets. They interact with the application's user context to manage the currently selected dataset.

### FullScreenModal.tsx
This component creates a full-screen modal dialog, providing a customizable container for displaying content over the main interface. It utilizes the `terracotta` library for its dialog components and SolidJS for conditional rendering and state management.

### InputRowsForm.tsx
This component generates a dynamic form with multiple input fields. It supports different input types (text, textarea, custom components) and provides customizable styling and button actions. It's designed for reusability in various form-based scenarios within the application.

### OnScreenThemeModeController.tsx
This component provides a visual controller for switching between light and dark themes. It manages the theme state, persists the user's preference in local storage, and updates the application's styling accordingly.

### OrganizationSelectBox.tsx
This component renders a dropdown menu for selecting an organization. It interacts with the user context to display the currently selected organization and update it upon user selection. It utilizes the `terracotta` library for its UI elements and SolidJS for reactivity.
