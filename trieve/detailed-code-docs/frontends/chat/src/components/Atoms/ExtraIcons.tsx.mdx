## High-level description
This file defines a React component called `TrieveLogo` that renders the Trieve logo as an image. The component is simple and straightforward, displaying the logo from a specified URL.

## Symbols

### `TrieveLogo`
#### Description
`TrieveLogo` is a functional React component that renders an `img` element with the Trieve logo.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props.

#### Outputs
Returns a JSX element representing an `img` tag.

#### Internal Logic
The component renders an `img` element with the following attributes:
- `src`: Set to "https://cdn.trieve.ai/trieve-logo.png", which is the URL of the Trieve logo image.
- `alt`: Set to an empty string, which may not be ideal for accessibility purposes.

## Dependencies
This component relies on React, which is implicitly imported and used for JSX syntax.

## Performance Considerations
As this component renders a simple image, it should have minimal performance impact. However, it's worth noting that the image is loaded from an external CDN, so the component's rendering speed may depend on the network connection and the CDN's response time.

## TODOs
Consider adding a meaningful `alt` text to the image for better accessibility. For example:
```jsx
&lt;img src="https://cdn.trieve.ai/trieve-logo.png" alt="Trieve Logo" /&gt;
```
