## High-level description
This code defines a UserContext and UserContextWrapper component in React, which manages user-related state and provides authentication functionality for a chat application. It handles user information, organization selection, dataset management, and login/logout operations.

## Code Structure
The main symbols in the code are:
1. `UserContext`: A React context that holds user-related state and functions.
2. `UserContextWrapper`: A component that provides the UserContext to its children and manages the user state.
3. Various signals and effects to handle user data, organization selection, and dataset management.

## Symbols

### UserContext
#### Description
A React context that provides user-related state and functions to child components.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| user | Accessor&lt;UserDTO \| null&gt; \| null | Current user information |
| setUser | (user: UserDTO \| null) =&gt; void | Function to set user information |
| organizations | Accessor&lt;OrganizationDTO[]&gt; \| null | List of user's organizations |
| currentOrganization | Accessor&lt;OrganizationDTO \| null&gt; \| null | Currently selected organization |
| setCurrentOrganization | (id: OrganizationDTO \| null) =&gt; void | Function to set current organization |
| currentDataset | Accessor&lt;DatasetAndUsageDTO \| null&gt; \| null | Currently selected dataset |
| setCurrentDataset | (dataset: DatasetAndUsageDTO \| null) =&gt; void | Function to set current dataset |
| datasetsAndUsages | Accessor&lt;DatasetAndUsageDTO[]&gt; \| null | List of datasets and their usage information |
| login | () =&gt; void | Function to initiate login process |
| logout | () =&gt; void | Function to log out user |

### UserContextWrapper
#### Description
A component that wraps its children with the UserContext provider and manages user-related state.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| children | JSX.Element | Child components to be wrapped |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes state for user, organizations, datasets, and selected organization/dataset.
2. Implements functions for getting and setting query parameters.
3. Defines a `login` function that fetches user data and sets the initial state.
4. Uses `createEffect` to handle side effects for:
   - Fetching datasets when the selected organization changes
   - Updating query parameters and local storage when the current dataset or organization changes
   - Automatically logging in on component mount

## Side Effects
- Fetches user data from the server
- Updates URL query parameters
- Stores and retrieves data from localStorage
- Fetches datasets based on the selected organization

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| solid-js | For creating reactive state and effects |
| @sentry/browser | For error tracking and monitoring |

## Error Handling
The code implements basic error handling by logging errors to the console and displaying error toasts to the user.

## API/Interface Reference
| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:------------|
| /auth/me | GET | Fetches current user information |
| /dataset/organization/${organization.id} | GET | Fetches datasets for a given organization |
