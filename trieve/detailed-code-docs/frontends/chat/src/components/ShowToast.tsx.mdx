## High-level description
This code defines a reusable toast notification system for a React application using SolidJS. It provides a `ShowToast` component and a `createToast` function to display and manage toast notifications with different types (success or error) and automatic dismissal after a set time.

## Code Structure
The code consists of two main parts: the `createToast` function for dispatching toast events, and the `ShowToast` component for rendering and managing toast notifications. These parts work together to provide a complete toast notification system.

## Symbols

### `createToast`
#### Description
This function creates and dispatches a custom event to show a toast notification.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| { type, message } | ToastDetail | An object containing the type and message for the toast |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a new CustomEvent named "show-toast"
2. Sets the event detail with the provided type and message
3. Dispatches the event on the window object

### `ShowToast`
#### Description
A component that listens for toast events, renders toast notifications, and manages their lifecycle.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses `createSignal` to manage the state of toast notifications
2. Sets up an effect to listen for "show-toast" events
3. Adds new toasts to the state when events are received
4. Sets a timeout to remove toasts after 5 seconds
5. Renders toasts using the `For` component from SolidJS
6. Provides different styling and icons based on the toast type
7. Allows manual dismissal of toasts

## Side Effects
- The component adds and removes an event listener on the window object
- It uses `setTimeout` to automatically remove toasts after a set duration
