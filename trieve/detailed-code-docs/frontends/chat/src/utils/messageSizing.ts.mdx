title: "messageSizing.ts"
---

## High-level description
This TypeScript file defines and exports two signals using SolidJS's `createSignal` function. These signals are related to message sizing and handle hover state in a chat application's user interface.

## Symbols

### `messageSizing` and `setMessageSizing`
#### Description
These are a pair of getter and setter functions created using SolidJS's `createSignal`. They manage the state of message sizing, likely used for controlling the layout of messages in the chat interface.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| messageSizing | () =&gt; [number, number] | A function that returns an array of two numbers representing the sizing of messages |
| setMessageSizing | (value: [number, number]) =&gt; void | A function to update the message sizing state |

#### Internal Logic
The initial value of the signal is set to `[0.65, 0.35]`, which likely represents a default split ratio for the message layout (e.g., 65% for one part and 35% for another).

### `HandleHoverState` type
#### Description
A custom type definition that represents the possible states of a handle hover.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| HandleHoverState | "none" \| "hover" \| "hold" | A union type of string literals representing different hover states |

### `handleHover` and `setHandleHover`
#### Description
Another pair of getter and setter functions created using `createSignal`. These manage the state of handle hovering in the user interface.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| handleHover | () =&gt; HandleHoverState | A function that returns the current handle hover state |
| setHandleHover | (value: HandleHoverState) =&gt; void | A function to update the handle hover state |

#### Internal Logic
The initial value of the signal is set to `"none"`, indicating no hover state by default.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| solid-js | Used for creating reactive state management with `createSignal` |

## Notes
This file is likely part of a larger chat application built with SolidJS. The `messageSizing` signal might be used to control the layout of message components, possibly in a split view or resizable panels. The `handleHover` signal could be used to manage hover effects on UI elements, potentially for resizing handles or other interactive components in the chat interface.

The values in `messageSizing` (0.65 and 0.35) sum up to 1, suggesting they might represent proportional sizes of two adjacent elements in the UI.

These signals can be imported and used in other components of the application to read or update the respective states reactively.
