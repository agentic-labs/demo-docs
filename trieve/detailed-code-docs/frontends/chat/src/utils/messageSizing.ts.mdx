title: "messageSizing.ts"
---

## High-level description
This TypeScript file defines and exports two signals using SolidJS's `createSignal` function. These signals are related to message sizing and handle hover state in a chat application's user interface.

## Symbols

### `messageSizing` and `setMessageSizing`
#### Description
These are a pair of getter and setter functions created using SolidJS's `createSignal`. They manage the state of message sizing, likely used for controlling the layout of messages in the chat interface.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| N/A | N/A | The signal is created with an initial value of `[0.65, 0.35]` |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| messageSizing | () =&gt; [number, number] | A function that returns the current message sizing values |
| setMessageSizing | (value: [number, number]) =&gt; void | A function to update the message sizing values |

#### Internal Logic
The initial value `[0.65, 0.35]` suggests that the message sizing is represented as two proportions, possibly for a two-column layout where messages take up 65% of the space and some other element (like a sidebar) takes up 35%.

### `handleHover` and `setHandleHover`
#### Description
These are another pair of getter and setter functions created using SolidJS's `createSignal`. They manage the state of handle hover, likely used for tracking the hover state of some interactive element in the chat interface.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| N/A | N/A | The signal is created with an initial value of `"none"` |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| handleHover | () =&gt; HandleHoverState | A function that returns the current handle hover state |
| setHandleHover | (value: HandleHoverState) =&gt; void | A function to update the handle hover state |

#### Internal Logic
The `HandleHoverState` type is defined as a union of three string literals: `"none"`, `"hover"`, and `"hold"`. This suggests that the handle can be in one of these three states, likely corresponding to different visual or interactive states in the UI.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| solid-js | Used for creating reactive signals with `createSignal` |

## Notes
1. This file is likely part of a larger chat application built with SolidJS, focusing on UI state management for message sizing and handle interactions.
2. The `messageSizing` signal might be used in conjunction with CSS to dynamically adjust the layout of the chat interface.
3. The `handleHover` signal could be used to manage the appearance or behavior of an interactive element (like a resize handle) based on user interaction.
4. These signals are exported, indicating they are likely used by other components in the application to read and update these states.
