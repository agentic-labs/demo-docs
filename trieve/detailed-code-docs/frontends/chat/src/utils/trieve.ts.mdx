## High-level description
This code creates and exports an instance of the Trieve client, configured with the API host URL from the environment variables. It provides a centralized way to interact with the Trieve API throughout the application.

## Symbols

### `trieve`
#### Description
This constant is an instance of the `Trieve` class, initialized with the base URL for API requests. It serves as the main entry point for making API calls to the Trieve service.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| baseUrl | string | The base URL for the Trieve API, obtained from the `VITE_API_HOST` environment variable |

#### Internal Logic
The `trieve` constant is created by instantiating the `Trieve` class with an options object. The `baseUrl` option is set using the `VITE_API_HOST` environment variable, which is accessed through `import.meta.env`. The `as string` type assertion is used to ensure TypeScript treats this value as a string.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| trieve-fetch-client | Provides the `Trieve` class for interacting with the Trieve API |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| VITE_API_HOST | string | N/A | The base URL for the Trieve API, set as an environment variable |

## References
This code references the `Trieve` class from the `trieve-fetch-client` package. Based on the related code snippet provided, we can infer that the `Trieve` class is defined in the `clients/fetch-client/src/index.ts` file.

The `Trieve` class appears to be a comprehensive client for interacting with the Trieve API. It handles various HTTP methods, request parameters, and response types. The class constructor takes an options object that includes the `baseUrl`, which is exactly what we're providing in this utility file.

By creating and exporting a single instance of the `Trieve` client, this utility ensures that all parts of the application can use the same configured client to interact with the Trieve API. This promotes consistency and reduces the potential for configuration errors across the application.
