## High-level description
This file is a TypeScript declaration file that references the type definitions for Vite, a build tool and development server. It ensures that TypeScript recognizes Vite-specific types and globals in the project.

## Symbols

### `/// &lt;reference types="vite/client" /&gt;`
#### Description
This is a triple-slash directive that tells TypeScript to include type definitions from the "vite/client" module. It allows the TypeScript compiler to recognize Vite-specific types and globals throughout the project.

#### Inputs
This directive does not have inputs in the traditional sense.

#### Outputs
This directive does not produce outputs directly. Instead, it makes Vite's type definitions available to the TypeScript compiler for the entire project.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| vite | Provides type definitions for Vite's client-side APIs and globals |

## Notes
1. This file is typically auto-generated when setting up a Vite project with TypeScript support.
2. It's crucial for enabling proper TypeScript type checking and autocompletion in a Vite-based project.
3. The file name "vite-env.d.ts" is a convention used by Vite to recognize and include these type definitions.
4. No additional code is needed in this file beyond the reference directive, as it serves solely to import type definitions.
