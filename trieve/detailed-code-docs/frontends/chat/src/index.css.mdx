## High-level description
This CSS file defines global styles for a chat application. It incorporates Tailwind CSS utility classes and includes custom styles for highlighting and formatting specific elements within the chat interface, particularly for a section with the ID "scoreChunk".

## Symbols

### Tailwind CSS Directives
#### Description
The file begins with three Tailwind CSS directives that inject Tailwind's base styles, component styles, and utility classes into the project.

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

These directives ensure that all of Tailwind's pre-defined styles are available for use in the project.

### #scoreChunk Styles
#### Description
A series of CSS rules are defined to style elements within an element with the ID "scoreChunk". These rules primarily focus on highlighting and formatting text content.

#### Internal Logic
1. Styles marked text and its child elements:
   ```css
   #scoreChunk mark &gt; div &gt; * {
     background-color: #fffebd;
     color: #000;
     font-weight: bolder;
     width: fit-content;
   }
   ```
   This rule applies to all descendants of `&lt;div&gt;` elements that are direct children of `&lt;mark&gt;` elements within `#scoreChunk`.

2. Styles paragraphs within marked text:
   ```css
   #scoreChunk mark &gt; p {
     background-color: #fffebd;
     color: #000;
     font-weight: bolder;
     width: fit-content;
   }
   ```

3. Sets background color for all `&lt;mark&gt;` elements:
   ```css
   #scoreChunk mark {
     background-color: #fffebd;
   }
   ```

4. Styles heading elements (h1 to h6) that are children of bold text within marked text:
   ```css
   #scoreChunk b &gt; mark &gt; h1,
   #scoreChunk b &gt; mark &gt; h2,
   #scoreChunk b &gt; mark &gt; h3,
   #scoreChunk b &gt; mark &gt; h4,
   #scoreChunk b &gt; mark &gt; h5,
   #scoreChunk b &gt; mark &gt; h6 {
     background-color: #fffebd;
     color: #000;
     font-weight: bolder;
     width: fit-content;
   }
   ```

### Debug Class
#### Description
A utility class for debugging purposes that adds a red outline to elements.

```css
.debug {
  outline: 1px solid red;
}
```

This class can be added to any HTML element to visually highlight it during development or debugging.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Tailwind CSS | Provides utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development |

## Notes
1. The consistent use of `#fffebd` as the background color for highlighted text suggests a standardized highlighting scheme across the application.
2. The `width: fit-content;` property is used frequently to ensure that the background highlight only covers the text content and not the entire width of the container.
3. The specificity of selectors (e.g., `#scoreChunk b &gt; mark &gt; h1`) indicates a need for precise control over styling in nested structures.
4. The `.debug` class provides a quick way to visually identify elements during development, which can be particularly useful in complex layouts.
