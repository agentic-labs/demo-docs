## High-level description
This CSS file defines global styles for a web application, utilizing Tailwind CSS and custom styles for specific elements. It focuses on styling highlighted text within a "scoreChunk" element and provides a utility class for debugging purposes.

## Symbols

### Tailwind CSS Directives
#### Description
The file begins with three Tailwind CSS directives that inject Tailwind's base, components, and utilities styles into the project.

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

These directives ensure that all of Tailwind's pre-defined styles are available for use in the project.

### #scoreChunk Styles
#### Description
A series of CSS rules are defined to style elements within an element with the ID "scoreChunk". These rules primarily focus on styling highlighted text (using the `&lt;mark&gt;` element) and its child elements.

#### Internal Logic
1. Styles for direct children of `&lt;mark&gt;` elements:
   ```css
   #scoreChunk mark &gt; div &gt; * {
     background-color: #fffebd;
     color: #000;
     font-weight: bolder;
     width: fit-content;
   }
   ```
   This rule applies to all descendants of `&lt;div&gt;` elements that are direct children of `&lt;mark&gt;` elements within `#scoreChunk`.

2. Styles for `&lt;p&gt;` elements that are direct children of `&lt;mark&gt;`:
   ```css
   #scoreChunk mark &gt; p {
     background-color: #fffebd;
     color: #000;
     font-weight: bolder;
     width: fit-content;
   }
   ```

3. Background color for `&lt;mark&gt;` elements:
   ```css
   #scoreChunk mark {
     background-color: #fffebd;
   }
   ```

4. Styles for heading elements (`h1` through `h6`) that are children of `&lt;mark&gt;` elements within `&lt;b&gt;` tags:
   ```css
   #scoreChunk b &gt; mark &gt; h1,
   #scoreChunk b &gt; mark &gt; h2,
   #scoreChunk b &gt; mark &gt; h3,
   #scoreChunk b &gt; mark &gt; h4,
   #scoreChunk b &gt; mark &gt; h5,
   #scoreChunk b &gt; mark &gt; h6 {
     background-color: #fffebd;
     color: #000;
     font-weight: bolder;
     width: fit-content;
   }
   ```

These rules consistently apply a light yellow background (`#fffebd`), black text color, bold font weight, and `fit-content` width to various elements within the `#scoreChunk` container.

### Debug Utility Class
#### Description
A utility class named "debug" is defined to add a red outline to elements for debugging purposes.

```css
.debug {
  outline: 1px solid red;
}
```

This class can be added to any HTML element to visually highlight its boundaries during development and debugging.

## Performance Considerations
The use of Tailwind CSS can lead to smaller file sizes in production builds due to its ability to purge unused styles. However, the specific element styling for `#scoreChunk` may not be as optimized and could potentially be refactored to use more reusable classes if the styles are applied to multiple elements throughout the application.
