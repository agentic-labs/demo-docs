## High-level description
The `frontends/chat/src/types` directory houses TypeScript type definitions and utility functions crucial for handling API interactions and message structures within a chat application. It ensures type safety and consistency throughout the codebase.

## What does it do?
This directory acts as a central repository for defining the shape and structure of data used in the chat application. It provides type definitions for API responses, user plans, and chat messages, ensuring that the application handles data consistently and predictably. Additionally, it includes utility functions for tasks like managing referral tokens in the browser's local storage and determining message roles in a conversation.

## Key Files

### `actix-api.ts`
This file focuses on types and functions related to API interactions, particularly with an Actix backend. It defines interfaces for API responses, including error structures and Stripe checkout session responses. It also includes functions for managing referral tokens in local storage, ensuring that these tokens are correctly stored and retrieved for user sessions.

### `messages.ts`
This file is dedicated to defining the structure and handling of messages within the chat application. It defines the `Message` interface, which outlines the structure of a chat message. It also includes type guard functions to verify if a given value is a valid `Message` or an array of `Message` objects. Additionally, it provides a utility function to determine the role of a message (system, assistant, or user) based on its index in a conversation. This file is crucial for maintaining the integrity and consistency of message data within the chat application.
