## High-level description
This directory contains TypeScript files that define types, interfaces, and utility functions for a chat application. The code primarily focuses on handling API responses, user plans, messages, and referral tokens. It provides type definitions and type guards to ensure type safety throughout the application.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory serves several purposes:

1. It defines the structure of API responses, particularly for Stripe checkout sessions and user subscription plans.
2. It provides utility functions for managing referral tokens, including storing and retrieving them from the browser's local storage.
3. It defines the structure of chat messages and offers functions to validate message objects and arrays.
4. It includes a function to determine the role of a message (system, assistant, or user) based on its position in a conversation.

These types and utilities help maintain consistency and type safety across the chat application, ensuring that data is properly structured and validated before being used in other parts of the codebase.

## Key Files

### actix-api.ts
This file focuses on API-related types and functions:

1. It defines interfaces for API responses, such as `ActixApiDefaultError` and `StripeCheckoutSessionResponse`.
2. It provides utility functions for managing referral tokens:
   - `detectReferralToken`: Detects and stores referral tokens in local storage.
   - `getReferralTokenArray`: Retrieves stored referral tokens.
3. It defines the `UserPlan` interface, representing a user's subscription plan.
4. It includes type guard functions like `isStripeCheckoutSessionResponse` and `isUserPlan` to validate object structures.

Example of detecting and storing a referral token:

```typescript
detectReferralToken("ABC123");
const storedTokens = getReferralTokenArray();
console.log(storedTokens); // ["ABC123"]
```

### messages.ts
This file defines types and utilities for handling chat messages:

1. It provides the `Message` interface, representing a single message in the chat.
2. It includes type guard functions:
   - `isMessage`: Checks if an object is a valid `Message`.
   - `isMessageArray`: Verifies if an array contains only `Message` objects.
3. It defines the `messageRoleFromIndex` function, which determines a message's role based on its position in a conversation.

Example of using the message utilities:

```typescript
const message = { content: "Hello, world!" };
console.log(isMessage(message)); // true

const messages = [
  { content: "System message" },
  { content: "User message" },
  { content: "Assistant response" }
];
console.log(isMessageArray(messages)); // true

console.log(messageRoleFromIndex(0)); // "system"
console.log(messageRoleFromIndex(1)); // "user"
console.log(messageRoleFromIndex(2)); // "assistant"
```

## Dependencies
The code in this directory doesn't rely on any external libraries or frameworks. It uses TypeScript's built-in types and features, as well as browser APIs like `localStorage` for managing referral tokens.

## Configuration
This directory doesn't contain any configuration files or use environment variables. However, it does interact with the browser's local storage for managing referral tokens, which can be considered a form of client-side configuration.

The `detectReferralToken` function in `actix-api.ts` stores referral tokens in the browser's local storage under the key "referralTokens". This allows the application to persist referral information across page reloads or sessions.

Example of how referral tokens are stored:

```typescript
// Local storage entry
{
  "referralTokens": ["ABC123", "XYZ789"]
}
```

Developers working with this code should be aware of this local storage usage and ensure that it aligns with the application's overall data management and privacy policies.
