## High-level description
This code is the entry point for a chat application built with SolidJS. It sets up Sentry for error tracking in production, renders the main Chat component wrapped in a UserContextWrapper, and mounts the application to the DOM.

## Code Structure
The code imports necessary dependencies, initializes Sentry for non-development environments, and renders the main application components.
