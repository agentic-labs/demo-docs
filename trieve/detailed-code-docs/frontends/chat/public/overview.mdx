## High-level description
The `frontends/chat/public` directory contains static assets and configuration files for the Trieve Chat application's frontend. These files are served directly to the browser and are essential for the application's appearance, basic functionality, and potential future features like offline support.

## What does it do?
This directory houses the files that determine how the Trieve Chat application looks and behaves when accessed through a web browser. It includes:

- **Visual elements:** Icons that represent the application on different devices.
- **Configuration:** A manifest file (`manifest.json`) that dictates how the application should be treated by browsers and operating systems, including its appearance when installed.
- **Service worker:** A JavaScript file (`sw.js`) that can be used to implement features like caching, offline access, and background updates, although it's currently inactive.

## Key Files
- **`manifest.json`:** This file configures the web application's appearance and behavior, such as its theme color, icons, and display mode. It's crucial for providing a native-app-like experience when the application is installed on a user's device.
- **`sw.js`:** This file contains a basic service worker implementation. While currently inactive, it lays the groundwork for potentially adding features like offline functionality and background updates in the future.

## Dependencies
The `manifest.json` file references external image files for the application's icons:

- `https://cdn.trieve.ai/android-chrome-192x192.png`: 192x192 pixel icon.
- `https://cdn.trieve.ai/android-chrome-512x512.png`: 512x512 pixel icon, also used as a maskable icon.
