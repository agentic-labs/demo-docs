## Symbols

### Root Object
#### Description
The root object of the manifest file contains various properties that define the web application's characteristics and appearance.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| theme_color | string | The primary theme color of the application |
| background_color | string | The background color of the application |
| display | string | The preferred display mode for the application |
| scope | string | The navigation scope of the application |
| start_url | string | The starting URL when the application is launched |
| name | string | The full name of the application |
| short_name | string | A shorter name for the application |
| description | string | A brief description of the application |
| icons | array | An array of icon objects for the application |

#### Internal Logic
The manifest file provides essential information for web browsers and operating systems to treat the web application as a installable, native-like application. It defines how the app should be displayed, what icons to use, and provides basic metadata about the application.

### Icons Array
#### Description
An array of icon objects that define the various icons used by the application at different sizes and for different purposes.

#### Inputs
Each icon object in the array has the following properties:
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| src | string | The URL of the icon image |
| sizes | string | The dimensions of the icon |
| type | string | The MIME type of the icon image |
| purpose | string (optional) | The purpose of the icon |

#### Internal Logic
The icons array provides multiple icon sizes to ensure the application has appropriate icons for various display contexts, such as app listings, home screens, and task switchers. The "purpose" property on the larger icon indicates it can be used as both a standard icon and a maskable icon, which is useful for adaptive icon shapes on some platforms.

## Dependencies
This manifest file doesn't directly depend on any external libraries or modules. However, it is typically used in conjunction with web applications, and in this case, it's part of a Solid.js-based chat application as indicated by the related `package.json` file.

## Configuration
The manifest file itself serves as a configuration for the web application. Key configurations include:

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| theme_color | string | "#292d30" | Sets the primary theme color |
| background_color | string | "#d0a65b" | Sets the background color |
| display | string | "standalone" | Defines how the app should be displayed |
| start_url | string | "/" | Sets the starting URL for the app |
| name | string | "Trieve Chat" | Sets the full name of the app |
| short_name | string | "LLM Chat" | Sets a shorter name for the app |

## API/Interface Reference
While not an API in the traditional sense, this manifest file exposes information that web browsers and operating systems use to integrate the web application. The key interface elements are:

| Property | Value | Description |
|:---------|:------|:------------|
| scope | "/" | Indicates the app's navigation scope |
| start_url | "/" | Defines the starting URL when launched |
| icons | Array of icon objects | Provides icons for various use cases and sizes |

This manifest allows the Trieve Chat application to be installed as a Progressive Web App (PWA), providing a more native-like experience on supporting platforms.
