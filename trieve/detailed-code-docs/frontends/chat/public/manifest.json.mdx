## Symbols

### Root Object
#### Description
The root object of the manifest file contains various properties that define the web application's characteristics and appearance.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| theme_color | string | The primary theme color of the application |
| background_color | string | The background color of the application |
| display | string | The preferred display mode for the website |
| scope | string | The navigation scope of this website's context |
| start_url | string | The URL that loads when a user launches the application |
| name | string | The full name of the application |
| short_name | string | A short name for the application |
| description | string | A description of the application |
| icons | array | An array of icon objects for the application |

#### Internal Logic
The manifest file provides essential information for web browsers and operating systems to treat the web application as a native app-like entity. It specifies how the app should be displayed, what colors to use, and what icons to show when installed.

### Icons Array
#### Description
An array of icon objects that define the various icons used for the application at different sizes and purposes.

#### Inputs
Each icon object in the array has the following properties:
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| src | string | The URL of the icon image |
| sizes | string | The dimensions of the icon |
| type | string | The MIME type of the icon |
| purpose | string (optional) | The purpose of the icon |

#### Internal Logic
The icons array provides multiple icon sizes to ensure the application has appropriate icons for various display contexts, such as app listings, home screens, and task switchers. The "purpose" property on the larger icon indicates it can be used as a maskable icon, which is useful for adaptive icon shapes on some platforms.

## Dependencies
This manifest file doesn't have direct code dependencies, but it relies on the existence of the icon files it references:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| https://cdn.trieve.ai/android-chrome-192x192.png | 192x192 pixel icon for the application |
| https://cdn.trieve.ai/android-chrome-512x512.png | 512x512 pixel icon for the application, also used as a maskable icon |

## Configuration
The manifest file itself serves as a configuration for the web application. Key configuration options include:
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| theme_color | string | "#292d30" | The primary theme color of the application |
| background_color | string | "#d0a65b" | The background color of the application |
