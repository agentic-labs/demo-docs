## High-level description
This file contains a basic service worker implementation. It sets up event listeners for the "install", "activate", and "fetch" events, but currently does not perform any actions in response to these events.

## Symbols

### `self.addEventListener("install", (_event) =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
This code adds an event listener for the "install" event of the service worker. The "install" event is typically used to set up caches and prepare the service worker for use.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| _event | Event | The install event object (currently unused) |

#### Internal Logic
Currently, this event listener does not perform any actions. The underscore prefix in `_event` suggests that the parameter is intentionally unused.

___

### `self.addEventListener("activate", (_event) =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
This code adds an event listener for the "activate" event of the service worker. The "activate" event is typically used to clean up old caches and perform actions that couldn't be done while an old version was still in use.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| _event | Event | The activate event object (currently unused) |

#### Internal Logic
Currently, this event listener does not perform any actions. The underscore prefix in `_event` suggests that the parameter is intentionally unused.

___

### `self.addEventListener("fetch", (_event) =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
This code adds an event listener for the "fetch" event of the service worker. The "fetch" event is triggered whenever the browser makes a network request for resources within the service worker's scope.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| _event | FetchEvent | The fetch event object (currently unused) |

#### Internal Logic
Currently, this event listener does not perform any actions. The underscore prefix in `_event` suggests that the parameter is intentionally unused.

## Dependencies
This code does not have any external dependencies.

## Configuration
There are no configuration options defined in this code.

## TODOs
While there are no explicit TODO comments in the code, the empty event listeners suggest that functionality may be added in the future. The current implementation appears to be a placeholder or skeleton for a more complete service worker.

## Notes
1. The file includes an ESLint disable comment at the top: `/* eslint-disable @typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars */`. This suggests that the code is part of a TypeScript project and that the unused variables are intentional.

2. The empty event listeners indicate that this service worker is not currently performing any caching, offline functionality, or network request interception. It's essentially a no-op service worker at this stage.

3. The presence of this file suggests that the application is set up to use service workers, which could be leveraged in the future for features like offline functionality, push notifications, or background sync.
