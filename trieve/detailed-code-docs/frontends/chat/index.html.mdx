### Theme Detection and Application
#### Description
This inline script detects and applies the user's preferred theme (light or dark) based on local storage or system preferences.

#### Internal Logic
1. Check if a theme is stored in localStorage
2. If not, check system preference for dark mode
3. Default to light theme if neither condition is met
4. Apply the selected theme by adding or removing the 'dark' class from the document element

### Service Worker Registration
#### Description
This inline script registers a service worker for the application, enabling offline functionality and improved performance.

#### Internal Logic
1. Check if the browser supports service workers
2. If supported, register the service worker file (sw.js) when the window loads
3. Log the result of the registration (success or failure)
