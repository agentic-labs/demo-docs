### `export default defineConfig(...)`
#### Description
This is the main configuration object for Vite, defined using the `defineConfig` function. It specifies the plugins to be used in the project.

#### Internal Logic
The configuration object includes a `plugins` array with two plugins:
1. `solid()`: Enables SolidJS support in the project.
2. `runtimeEnv()`: Allows the use of runtime environment variables.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| vite | The build tool and development server |
| vite-plugin-solid | Plugin for SolidJS support in Vite |

This configuration file sets up a basic Vite environment for a SolidJS project with support for runtime environment variables. It's a minimal setup that can be extended with additional plugins or configuration options as needed for the project.
