title: "Dockerfile"
---

## High-level description
This Dockerfile defines a multi-stage build process for a chat application frontend. It builds the application using Node.js and then creates a lightweight Nginx-based image to serve the static files. The final image includes custom Nginx configuration and a script to inject environment variables into the HTML file at runtime.

## Code Structure
The Dockerfile consists of two main stages:
1. Build stage: Uses Node.js to build the chat application
2. Production stage: Uses Nginx to serve the built application

## Symbols

### Build Stage
#### Description
This stage sets up the Node.js environment, copies the necessary files, and builds the chat application.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses `node:18` as the base image
2. Sets the working directory to `/app`
3. Copies package files, yarn lock, and turbo configuration
4. Copies the frontend and client SDK files
5. Installs dependencies using yarn
6. Builds the chat application using the turbo build system

### Production Stage
#### Description
This stage creates a lightweight Nginx-based image to serve the built chat application.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses `nginx:1.25.4-alpine-slim` as the base image
2. Copies the built application from the build stage to Nginx's HTML directory
3. Adds a custom Nginx configuration for serving the single-page application
4. Adds a script to inject environment variables into the HTML file at runtime
5. Sets the script as executable
6. Exposes port 80 for web traffic

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Node.js 18 | Used for building the application |
| Nginx 1.25.4 (Alpine) | Used for serving the built application |
| yarn | Package manager for installing dependencies |
| turbo | Build system for the application |

## Configuration
The Dockerfile includes a custom Nginx configuration to serve the single-page application:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    root /usr/share/nginx/html;
    index index.html;
    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
    }
}
```

This configuration ensures that all routes are directed to the `index.html` file, which is necessary for single-page applications.

## Side Effects
The Dockerfile includes a script (`01-insert-window-variable.sh`) that modifies the `index.html` file at runtime to inject environment variables. This allows for dynamic configuration of the application based on the environment in which the container is run.

## Performance Considerations
1. The multi-stage build process helps to keep the final image size small by excluding build tools and dependencies.
2. Using the Alpine-based Nginx image further reduces the final image size.
3. The custom Nginx configuration is optimized for serving single-page applications.
