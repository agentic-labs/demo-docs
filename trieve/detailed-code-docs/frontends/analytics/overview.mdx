## High-level description
This directory contains the source code for the Trieve Analytics dashboard, a frontend application built using Solid.js. It provides a user interface for visualizing and analyzing search performance, user behavior, and system usage data related to search and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) operations.

## What does it do?
The Trieve Analytics dashboard offers the following key functionalities:

1. Visualizes search performance metrics such as click-through rates (CTR) and latency.
2. Displays usage statistics, including query counts and types of searches performed.
3. Highlights potential issues by showing low-confidence queries and searches with no results.
4. Illustrates advanced features like RAG usage.
5. Provides overall search usage trends over time.
6. Offers a data explorer with tabbed navigation for different views.
7. Implements user authentication and organization selection.
8. Fetches and displays analytics data from the backend API.

## Entry points
The main entry points for this application are:

1. `index.html`: The HTML template that serves as the container for the Solid.js application.
2. `src/index.tsx`: The main application entry point that sets up routing, query client, and renders the top-level components.
3. `src/pages/`: Contains individual page components that serve as entry points for different views in the application.
4. `src/layouts/TopBarLayout.tsx`: The main layout component that wraps most of the application's content.

## Key Files
1. `src/components/`: Contains reusable UI components for charts, tables, and other visualizations.
2. `src/contexts/`: Provides context providers for user authentication and organization selection.
3. `src/hooks/`: Contains custom hooks for pagination, pathname retrieval, and CTR setup checks.
4. `src/layouts/`: Includes layout components for structuring the user interface.
5. `src/pages/`: Contains page components for different views in the analytics dashboard.
6. `src/api/`: Includes functions for interacting with the backend API.
7. `src/utils/`: Provides utility functions for date formatting, API host configuration, and enhanced navigation.

## Dependencies
The project relies on several key dependencies:

1. solid-js: Core library for building reactive user interfaces.
2. @solidjs/router: Routing library for SolidJS applications.
3. @tanstack/solid-query: Data fetching and state management library.
4. chart.js: Library for creating charts and data visualizations.
5. date-fns: Library for date manipulation and formatting.
6. trieve-fetch-client: Client library for interacting with the Trieve API.
7. tailwindcss: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
8. vite: Build tool and development server.

## Configuration
The application uses various configuration approaches:

1. Environment variables: API URLs and other settings are accessed using `import.meta.env.VITE_*`.
2. Context-based configuration: Some components use context to access global settings like the current dataset or organization ID.
3. API host configuration: The `apiHost.ts` file in the `utils` directory defines the base URL for API requests.
4. ESLint configuration: `.eslintrc.json` sets up linting rules for TypeScript and Solid.js development.
5. PostCSS configuration: `postcss.config.js` sets up Tailwind CSS and Autoprefixer for CSS processing.
6. TypeScript configuration: `tsconfig.json` extends a base configuration and specifies compiler options.
7. Vite configuration: `vite.config.ts` sets up the build process with Solid.js and runtime environment variable support.

Key configurable aspects include:
- API endpoint URLs
- Default date ranges for analytics data
- Pagination settings
- Chart and graph configurations

The Trieve Analytics dashboard provides a comprehensive and interactive interface for users to explore and analyze search and RAG-related data. It leverages SolidJS's reactivity model, various charting libraries, and modern web development tools to create a responsive and informative analytics platform.
