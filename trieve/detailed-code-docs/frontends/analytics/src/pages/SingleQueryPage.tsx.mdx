title: "SingleQueryPage.tsx"
---

## High-level description
The `SingleQueryPage` component in `SingleQueryPage.tsx` is a simple SolidJS component that renders the `SingleQuery` component, passing it the query ID extracted from the route parameters. This suggests that this page is intended to display detailed information about a single query, likely retrieved using the provided ID. 

## References
This code references the following symbols:
- `useParams` from "@solidjs/router"
- `SingleQuery` from "../components/SingleQueryInfo"

## Symbols
### `SingleQueryPage`
#### Description
This is a SolidJS component that represents a page dedicated to displaying information about a single query. It extracts the query ID from the URL parameters and passes it to the `SingleQuery` component.

#### Inputs
This component does not receive any props.

#### Outputs
- **JSX Element:** A `div` element containing the `SingleQuery` component.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Extract Query ID:** The component uses the `useParams` hook from `solidjs/router` to retrieve the route parameters. It specifically accesses the `id` parameter, which presumably represents the query ID.
2. **Render SingleQuery Component:** The extracted `queryId` is then passed as a prop to the `SingleQuery` component. This suggests that `SingleQuery` is responsible for fetching and displaying the details of the query using the provided ID.
