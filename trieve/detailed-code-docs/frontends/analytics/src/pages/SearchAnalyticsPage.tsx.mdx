## High-level description
The `SearchAnalyticsPage` component renders the search analytics page of the application. It displays various charts and tables related to search usage, latency, and query analysis, allowing users to understand search behavior and identify potential issues.

## Code Structure
The `SearchAnalyticsPage` component uses the `FilterBar` component to allow users to filter analytics data by date range, search method, and search type. It then renders a grid layout containing several `ChartCard` components, each displaying a specific analytics chart or table. The charts and tables themselves are defined in separate components, such as `SearchUsageGraph`, `LatencyGraph`, `HeadQueries`, `LowConfidenceQueries`, and `NoResultQueries`.

3. **Renders analytics charts and tables:** Renders a grid layout containing `ChartCard` components, each displaying a specific analytics visualization:
    - `SearchUsageGraph`: Displays a bar chart of search usage over time.
    - `LatencyGraph`: Displays a line chart of search latency over time.
    - `HeadQueries`: Displays a table of the most popular search queries.
    - `LowConfidenceQueries`: Displays a table of queries with low confidence scores.
    - `NoResultQueries`: Displays a table of queries that returned no results.
