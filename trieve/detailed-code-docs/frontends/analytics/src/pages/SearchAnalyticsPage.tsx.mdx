## High-level description
The `SearchAnalyticsPage` component renders the search analytics page of the application. It displays various charts and tables related to search usage, latency, and query analysis, allowing users to understand search performance and user behavior. The page includes filters for customizing the displayed data.

## Code Structure
The `SearchAnalyticsPage` component uses the `FilterBar` component to manage filter settings and several other components to display different types of charts and tables. The `createStore` function from Solid.js is used to manage the state of the analytics filters.

## References
- `FilterBar`: Component for managing analytics filters.
- `AnalyticsParams`: Type definition for analytics filter parameters.
- `LatencyGraph`: Component for displaying search latency over time.
- `SearchUsageGraph`: Component for displaying search usage over time.
- `HeadQueries`: Component for displaying the most popular search queries.
- `LowConfidenceQueries`: Component for displaying queries with low confidence scores.
- `NoResultQueries`: Component for displaying queries that returned no results.
- `ChartCard`: Component for wrapping charts with a consistent card layout.

## Symbols
### `SearchAnalyticsPage`
#### Description
This component renders the search analytics page, including filter controls and various charts and tables for analyzing search data.

#### Inputs
This component does not take any explicit inputs.

#### Outputs
This component renders the JSX structure of the search analytics page.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Initializes analytics filters:**
   - Uses `createStore` to create a state variable `analyticsFilters` with an initial value containing default filter settings.
2. **Renders the `FilterBar` component:**
   - Passes the `analyticsFilters` state and the `setAnalyticsFilters` function to the `FilterBar` component, allowing it to display and update the filter settings.
3. **Renders the analytics dashboard:**
   - Uses a grid layout to arrange various chart components.
   - Each chart component receives the `analyticsFilters` state as props, ensuring they display data according to the current filter settings.
   - The following chart components are used:
     - `SearchUsageGraph`: Displays search usage over time.
     - `LatencyGraph`: Displays search latency over time.
     - `HeadQueries`: Displays the most popular search queries.
     - `LowConfidenceQueries`: Displays queries with low confidence scores.
     - `NoResultQueries`: Displays queries that returned no results.

## Dependencies
- `solid-js`: For component state management and rendering.
- `date-fns`: For date manipulation.
- `shared/types`: For type definitions.
- `../components/FilterBar`: For the filter bar component.
- `../components/charts/*`: For various chart components.

### Configuration
This component does not define any specific configuration options.
