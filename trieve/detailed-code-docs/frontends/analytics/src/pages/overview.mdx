## High-level description
This directory contains components for rendering table-based analytics pages in the frontend application. It includes two main components: SearchTablePage and RAGTablePage. The SearchTablePage is a fully implemented component for displaying and interacting with search query data, while the RAGTablePage is currently a placeholder for future implementation.

## What does it do?
The main functionality of this directory is to provide user interfaces for viewing and analyzing tabular data related to search queries and potentially RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) data in the future. 

The SearchTablePage allows users to:
1. View a table of search queries for a selected dataset
2. Filter the data based on date range, search method, and search type
3. Sort the data by different columns (e.g., searched at time, latency, top score)
4. Paginate through the search query results
5. Navigate to individual query details

The RAGTablePage is currently a placeholder and doesn't provide any functionality yet.

## Key Files

1. SearchTablePage.tsx
   - This is the main component for displaying search query data in a table format.
   - It fetches data from the backend API using the `getSearchQueries` function.
   - Implements filtering, sorting, and pagination functionality.
   - Uses caching mechanisms to improve performance.
   - Renders the table using sub-components like FilterBar, Table, and PaginationButtons.

2. RAGTablePage.tsx
   - Currently a placeholder component for future implementation of RAG-related data display.
   - Only renders a simple "Test" text within nested div elements.

## Dependencies
The SearchTablePage component relies on several external libraries and frameworks:

1. SolidJS: The core framework used for building the user interface.
2. @tanstack/solid-query: Used for data fetching and caching.
3. date-fns: Used for date and time formatting.
4. solid-icons/ai: Provides icons for the user interface.
5. @solidjs/router: Used for routing within the application.

## Configuration
The SearchTablePage component uses the following configuration:

1. DatasetContext: Accessed via `useContext(DatasetContext)` to get the selected dataset ID.
2. Filter state: Managed using `createStore` with initial values for date range, search method, and search type.
3. Sorting state: Managed using `createSignal` for sort order and sort by column.
4. Pagination: Managed using the `usePagination` hook and `createSignal` for page state.

Example of filter state configuration:

```typescript
const [filters, setFilters] = createStore&lt;AnalyticsParams["filter"]&gt;({
  dateRange: {
    start: subDays(new Date(), 7).toISOString(),
    end: new Date().toISOString(),
  },
  searchMethod: "all",
  searchType: "all",
});
```

This configuration sets up initial filter values, including a default date range of the last 7 days and default values for search method and type.
