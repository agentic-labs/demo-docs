## High-level description
This directory contains components for rendering different pages in an analytics frontend application. It includes pages for CTR (Click-Through Rate) analytics, an overview page, RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) analytics, search analytics, single query details, trend exploration, and error handling. The pages are designed to display various charts, tables, and interactive elements to help users analyze search and RAG-related data.

## What does it do?
The pages in this directory collectively provide a comprehensive analytics interface for search and RAG-related data:

1. CTR Analytics Page: Currently a placeholder for future CTR analysis functionality.
2. Overview Page: Displays key metrics and charts related to search usage, including requests per second, head queries, query counts, and CTR information.
3. RAG Analytics Page: Provides analytics for RAG usage, including filters for date range and RAG type, and displays usage graphs and query information.
4. Search Analytics Page: Offers detailed analytics on search usage, latency, and query analysis, allowing users to identify trends and potential issues.
5. Single Query Page: Displays detailed information about a specific search query.
6. Trend Explorer: Shows a table of trending search topics and allows users to explore related searches.
7. Error Pages: Handles scenarios such as when no datasets are found for an organization.

These pages use various components to fetch data from APIs, render charts and tables, and provide interactive elements like filters and modals for a comprehensive analytics experience.

## Entry points
The main entry points for this directory are the individual page components:

1. `CTRAnalyticsPage.tsx`: Entry point for CTR analytics (currently a placeholder).
2. `OverviewPage.tsx`: Main overview page displaying various search analytics metrics.
3. `RagAnalyticsPage.tsx`: Entry point for RAG-specific analytics.
4. `SearchAnalyticsPage.tsx`: Comprehensive search analytics page.
5. `SingleQueryPage.tsx`: Page for displaying details of a single query.
6. `TrendExplorer.tsx`: Page for exploring trending search topics.

Each of these components serves as the main container for its respective functionality, orchestrating data fetching, state management, and rendering of child components.

## Key Files
1. `OverviewPage.tsx`: Renders the main overview page with key metrics and charts.
2. `SearchAnalyticsPage.tsx`: Provides detailed search analytics with various charts and tables.
3. `RagAnalyticsPage.tsx`: Displays RAG-specific analytics and usage data.
4. `TrendExplorer.tsx`: Implements a trend exploration interface for search topics.
5. `errors/NoDatasetsErrorPage.tsx`: Handles the error scenario when no datasets are found.
6. `tablePages/SearchTablePage.tsx`: Implements a detailed table view for search query data.

These files contain the core logic for data fetching, state management, and rendering of the analytics interface.

## Dependencies
The pages in this directory rely on several key dependencies:

1. solid-js: Used for creating reactive components and managing state.
2. @tanstack/solid-query: Provides data fetching and caching capabilities.
3. date-fns: Used for date and time manipulation.
4. shared/ui: Provides shared UI components like tables, date pickers, and modals.
5. shared/types: Provides shared type definitions.
6. @solidjs/router: Used for routing functionality.

These dependencies were chosen to provide a robust foundation for building interactive and performant analytics pages using the SolidJS framework.

## Configuration
The pages use various configuration approaches:

1. Environment variables: API URLs and other configuration settings are accessed using `import.meta.env.VITE_*`.
2. Context-based configuration: Some components use context to access global settings like the current dataset or organization ID.
3. Default filter states: Many pages initialize filter states with default values, such as displaying data from the last 7 days.

Example of filter state initialization:

```typescript
const [filters, setFilters] = createStore&lt;AnalyticsParams["filter"]&gt;({
  start_date: subDays(new Date(), 7).toISOString(),
  end_date: new Date().toISOString(),
  search_method: "hybrid",
  search_type: "search",
  granularity: "minute",
});
```

This configuration approach allows for flexibility in deployment across different environments while providing sensible defaults for user interaction.
