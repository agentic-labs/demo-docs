## High-level description
The `RagAnalyticsPage` component renders a page for analyzing RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) usage data. It provides filters for date range and RAG type, and displays a usage graph and a table of RAG queries.

## Code Structure
The `RagAnalyticsPage` component uses the `createStore` and `createSignal` hooks from SolidJS to manage its state. It defines a filter object to store the selected date range and RAG type, and a fakeType signal to handle the UI representation of the RAG type selection. The component then uses the `createEffect` hook to synchronize the fakeType signal with the actual filter value. Finally, it renders a UI consisting of a `Select` component for choosing the RAG type, a `DateRangePicker` component for selecting the date range, a `RAGUsageGraph` component to visualize the usage data, and a `RagQueries` component to display the list of RAG queries.

## Symbols
### `RagAnalyticsPage`
#### Description
This component renders the RAG Analytics page, allowing users to filter and view RAG usage data.

#### Inputs
This component does not take any props.

#### Outputs
This component renders the RAG Analytics page UI.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Initializes state:**
    - `filter`: A store holding the current filter settings for the analytics data. It's initialized with a default date range of the past 7 days and no specific RAG type.
    - `fakeType`: A signal to manage the UI representation of the RAG type filter. It's initialized with the "Both" option.
2. **Synchronizes `fakeType` with `filter.rag_type`:**
    - An effect observes changes to `fakeType`. If the selected value is "both", it sets `filter.rag_type` to `undefined`. Otherwise, it updates `filter.rag_type` with the corresponding value from `fakeType`.
3. **Renders UI:**
    - A container `div` with styling for layout.
    - A `Select` component for choosing the RAG type. It uses `fakeType` for its state and updates it via `setFakeType`.
    - A `DateRangePicker` component for selecting the date range. It uses `filter.date_range` for its state and updates it via `setFilter`. It also suggests a granularity based on the selected range.
    - A `RAGUsageGraph` component to visualize the usage data. It receives the `filter` and `granularity` as props.
    - A `RagQueries` component to display the list of RAG queries, receiving the `filter` as props.
