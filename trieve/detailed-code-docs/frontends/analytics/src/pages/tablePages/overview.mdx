## High-level description
This directory contains components for displaying table-based pages in an analytics frontend application. It includes two main components: `RAGTablePage` and `SearchTablePage`. The `RAGTablePage` is currently a placeholder, while the `SearchTablePage` is a fully implemented component for displaying and interacting with search query data.

## What does it do?
The main functionality of this directory is provided by the `SearchTablePage` component. It allows users to view, filter, sort, and paginate through search query data for a specific dataset. Here's what it does:

1. Fetches search query data from an API based on user-defined filters, sorting preferences, and pagination settings.
2. Displays the data in a table format, showing information such as query text, timestamp, search method, latency, and top score.
3. Provides a filter bar for users to refine the displayed data, including options like date range selection.
4. Allows users to sort the data by clicking on sortable column headers.
5. Implements pagination to navigate through large datasets.
6. Enables users to click on individual rows to view more detailed information about a specific search query.

The `RAGTablePage` is currently a placeholder for future functionality related to Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) data.

## Key Files

1. `SearchTablePage.tsx`: This is the main component file that implements the search query table functionality. It contains the following key components:
   - `SearchTablePage`: The main component that orchestrates the entire page.
   - `SortableHeader`: A reusable component for creating sortable table headers.
   - `SearchRow`: A component that renders individual rows in the search query table.

2. `RAGTablePage.tsx`: This file contains a placeholder component for future RAG-related functionality.

## Dependencies
The `SearchTablePage` component relies on several external libraries and internal modules:

1. solid-js: Used for creating reactive components and managing state.
2. @tanstack/solid-query: Provides data fetching and caching capabilities.
3. date-fns: Used for date and time manipulation.
4. shared/ui: Provides shared UI components like `Table`, `Td`, `Th`, `DateRangePicker`, and `Select`.
5. shared/types: Provides shared type definitions.
6. solid-icons/ai: Provides icons from the Ant Design library.
7. @solidjs/router: Used for routing functionality.

These dependencies were likely chosen for their compatibility with the SolidJS framework and their specific functionalities that align with the requirements of the analytics frontend.

## Configuration
The `SearchTablePage` component uses a context-based configuration for the dataset ID. It retrieves the `dataset` context, which is likely set at a higher level in the application hierarchy. This allows the component to fetch data specific to the current dataset without requiring explicit props.

The component also uses some hardcoded configuration, such as the initial filter state to display queries from the last 7 days. This could potentially be moved to a configuration file or made customizable in the future.

Here's an example of how the initial filter state is set:

```typescript
const [filters, setFilters] = createStore&lt;AnalyticsParams["filter"]&gt;({
  start_date: subDays(new Date(), 7).toISOString(),
  end_date: new Date().toISOString(),
});
```

The component also uses environment variables or configuration settings for API endpoints, as evidenced by the use of `import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL` in the data fetching logic. This allows for easy configuration of the API URL across different environments.

In summary, this directory provides a robust implementation of a search query analytics table with various interactive features, while also leaving room for future expansion with the RAG table placeholder.
