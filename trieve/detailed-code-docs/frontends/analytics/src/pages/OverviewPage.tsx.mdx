## High-level description
The `OverviewPage` component renders the main overview page of the analytics dashboard, presenting key metrics and charts related to search usage and performance. It utilizes various sub-components to display charts for query counts, requests per second, and head queries, along with an information panel for CTR insights.

## Code Structure
The `OverviewPage` component primarily uses functional composition, rendering and configuring several child components responsible for fetching data and displaying charts. It leverages the `SimpleTimeRangeSelector` and `useSimpleTimeRange` hook for time-based filtering in the "Requests Per Second" and "Head Queries" charts. The `ChartCard` component is used as a wrapper to provide consistent styling and layout for each chart.

## Symbols
### Symbol Name: `OverviewPage`
#### Description
This functional component renders the main content of the analytics overview page. It sets up the layout and configures the individual chart components.

#### Inputs
This component does not accept any explicit inputs.

#### Outputs
This component renders the JSX structure of the overview page, including the CTR info panel and various charts.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Time Range Management:** It initializes two instances of `useSimpleTimeRange` to manage time range selections for the "Requests Per Second" and "Head Queries" charts independently.
2. **Layout and Rendering:** It uses a grid layout to arrange the CTR info panel and chart cards.
3. **Chart Configuration:** It renders `QueryCounts`, `SearchUsageGraph`, and `HeadQueries` components within `ChartCard` containers, passing the appropriate time range filters and other parameters.
