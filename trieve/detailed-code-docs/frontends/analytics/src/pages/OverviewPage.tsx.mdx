## High-level description
The `OverviewPage` component renders the main overview page for search analytics, displaying key metrics and charts related to search usage. It includes components for tracking requests per second, head queries, query counts, and click-through rate (CTR) information.

## Code Structure
The `OverviewPage` component utilizes several child components to display different aspects of the search analytics overview. It uses `ChartCard` to encapsulate individual charts and their associated controls, such as time range selectors. The `SimpleTimeRangeSelector` component is used within `ChartCard` to allow users to adjust the time period for the displayed data. The `QueryCounts`, `SearchUsageGraph`, and `HeadQueries` components are responsible for fetching and rendering the specific data for their respective charts. The `CTRInfoPanel` displays information about the CTR setup status.

### `OverviewPage`
#### Description
This component renders the main layout and content of the search analytics overview page. It fetches data for and renders charts related to requests per second, head queries, and query counts. It also displays information about CTR setup.

#### Inputs
This component does not take any explicit inputs.

#### Outputs
This component renders the JSX structure for the overview page.

#### Internal Logic
1. **State Management:** It uses the `useSimpleTimeRange` hook to manage the selected time range for the RPS and Head Queries charts.
2. **Component Composition:** It composes the following child components:
    - `CTRInfoPanel`: Displays information about CTR setup.
    - `ChartCard`: Encapsulates individual charts and their controls.
        - `QueryCounts`: Displays the total count of queries by type.
        - `SearchUsageGraph`: Displays a graph of requests per second over time.
        - `HeadQueries`: Displays a list of the most frequent search queries.
3. **Data Fetching and Rendering:** Each chart component is responsible for fetching its own data based on the selected time range and rendering it accordingly.

#### Side Effects
This component does not have any direct side effects. However, the child components it renders may have side effects related to data fetching and state updates.

#### Performance Considerations
This component relies on child components to handle data fetching and rendering. The performance of the overall page will depend on the efficiency of these child components.
