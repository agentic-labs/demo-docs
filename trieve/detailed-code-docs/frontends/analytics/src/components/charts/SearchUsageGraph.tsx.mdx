## High-level description
The `SearchUsageGraph` component renders a bar chart visualizing the number of search requests over time. It fetches search usage data based on provided filters and granularity, then dynamically updates a Chart.js instance.

## Code Structure
The `SearchUsageGraph` component uses the `createQuery` hook to fetch search usage data. The `createEffect` hook handles creating and updating the Chart.js instance based on the fetched data and component props. The `onCleanup` hook ensures proper cleanup of the chart instance when the component unmounts.

## References
- `getRpsUsageGraph`: Fetches search usage data from the API.
- `DatasetContext`: Provides access to the selected dataset's ID.
- `AnalyticsFilter`, `AnalyticsParams`: Define the structure of filter and granularity parameters.

### `SearchUsageGraph`
#### Description
A SolidJS component that renders a bar chart displaying search usage over time. It fetches data based on provided filters and granularity, then dynamically updates the chart.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| props | `SearchUsageProps` | An object containing filter and granularity settings for the search usage data. |

#### Outputs
Renders a `&lt;canvas&gt;` element containing the search usage bar chart.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Data Fetching:** Uses `createQuery` to fetch search usage data from the `getRpsUsageGraph` API function based on the provided `props.params` (filter and granularity) and the selected dataset ID from `DatasetContext`.
2. **Chart Initialization:** When the component mounts and data is fetched, a Chart.js instance is created on the `&lt;canvas&gt;` element. The chart is initialized with basic styling and configuration for a bar chart.
3. **Chart Updating:** The `createEffect` hook observes changes to the fetched data and component props. When changes occur:
    - The chart's data labels are updated with timestamps from the fetched data points.
    - The chart's dataset is updated with the `requests` values from the fetched data points.
    - The chart's x-axis scale is dynamically adjusted based on the selected granularity (`day`, `minute`, or other).
    - The chart's bar thickness is adjusted based on the number of data points.
    - The `chartInstance.update()` method is called to redraw the chart with the new data and configuration.
4. **Cleanup:** The `onCleanup` hook ensures that the Chart.js instance is properly destroyed when the component unmounts to prevent memory leaks.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @tanstack/solid-query | Used for data fetching and caching. |
| chart.js | Used for rendering the bar chart. |
| chartjs-adapter-date-fns | Used for date formatting and manipulation on the chart's x-axis. |
| date-fns/locale/enUS | Provides English (US) locale for date formatting. |

## Side Effects
- Fetches data from the `/analytics/search` API endpoint.
- Renders and updates a Chart.js instance on the page.
