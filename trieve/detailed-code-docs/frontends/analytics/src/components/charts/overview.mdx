## High-level description
This directory contains various chart and data visualization components used in the analytics frontend. These components are responsible for fetching, processing, and displaying different types of analytics data, such as search usage, latency, query counts, and RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) usage.

## What does it do?
The components in this directory work together to provide a comprehensive analytics dashboard for search and RAG-related metrics. They fetch data from backend APIs, process it, and render it in various formats such as tables, line charts, and bar charts. These visualizations help users understand search performance, usage patterns, and the effectiveness of RAG implementations.

Key functionalities include:
1. Displaying search usage over time
2. Visualizing search latency
3. Showing query counts by search type
4. Presenting RAG usage statistics
5. Listing low confidence queries and queries with no results
6. Providing detailed views of individual search events

## Entry points
The main entry points for this directory are the individual chart components:

1. `SearchUsageGraph.tsx`: Renders a bar chart of search requests over time.
2. `LatencyGraph.tsx`: Displays a line chart of average search latency.
3. `QueryCounts.tsx`: Shows a breakdown of total searches by type.
4. `RAGUsageGraph.tsx`: Visualizes RAG usage over time.
5. `LowConfidenceQueries.tsx`: Lists queries with low confidence scores.
6. `NoResultQueries.tsx`: Displays queries that returned no results.
7. `CTRSummary.tsx`: Provides a summary of click-through rate statistics.
8. `HeadQueries.tsx`: Shows the most frequent search queries.
9. `RagQueries.tsx`: Displays a table of RAG queries with sorting and filtering options.

These components can be imported and used in higher-level pages or layouts to compose the analytics dashboard.

## Key Files
1. `ChartCard.tsx`: A reusable component for wrapping charts and tables in a consistent card-like container.
2. `QueryStringDisplay.tsx`: A utility component for displaying search query strings, handling multi-query scenarios.

## Dependencies
The components in this directory rely on several key external libraries:

1. `@tanstack/solid-query`: Used for data fetching, caching, and state management.
2. `chart.js`: The primary library for rendering charts and graphs.
3. `chartjs-adapter-date-fns`: An adapter for using date-fns with Chart.js for better date handling on axes.
4. `date-fns`: Used for date formatting and manipulation.
5. `solid-js`: The core library for building the user interface and managing component state.
6. `shared/ui`: A collection of shared UI components used across the application.

## Configuration
The components in this directory don't have specific configuration files. Instead, they rely on props passed from parent components to configure their behavior, such as date ranges, filters, and granularity settings. Many components also use the `DatasetContext` to access the currently selected dataset ID.

In summary, this directory contains a collection of specialized chart and data visualization components that form the core of the analytics frontend. These components work together to provide a comprehensive view of search and RAG performance metrics, allowing users to gain insights into their system's behavior and identify areas for improvement.
