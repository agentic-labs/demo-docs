## High-level description
This directory contains various chart components used in the analytics frontend of the application. These components are responsible for visualizing different types of data related to search analytics, including click-through rates, query counts, latency, RAG usage, and more.

## What does it do?
The components in this directory work together to provide a comprehensive analytics dashboard for search-related data. They fetch data from backend APIs, process it, and render it in various chart formats such as line graphs, bar charts, and tables. These visualizations help users understand search performance, user behavior, and system usage over time.

Key functionalities include:
1. Displaying click-through rate (CTR) summaries
2. Showing query counts and types of searches
3. Visualizing search latency over time
4. Presenting lists of low-confidence and no-result queries
5. Illustrating RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) usage
6. Showing overall search usage trends

## Key Files
1. `CTRSummary.tsx`: Displays a summary of click-through rate statistics.
2. `QueryCounts.tsx`: Shows the total number of searches categorized by search type and method.
3. `LatencyGraph.tsx`: Renders a line chart of average search latency over time.
4. `LowConfidenceQueries.tsx`: Presents a table of search queries with low confidence scores.
5. `NoResultQueries.tsx`: Lists search queries that returned no results.
6. `RAGUsageGraph.tsx`: Visualizes the usage of Retrieval Augmented Generation over time.
7. `SearchUsageGraph.tsx`: Displays a bar chart of overall search usage.
8. `ChartCard.tsx`: A reusable component for wrapping charts in a card-like container.

## Dependencies
The components in this directory rely on several key dependencies:

1. `@tanstack/solid-query`: Used for efficient data fetching, caching, and state management.
2. `solid-js`: The core library for building reactive UI components.
3. `chart.js`: Utilized for rendering various types of charts.
4. `date-fns`: Employed for date manipulation and formatting.
5. `shared/ui`: Provides common UI components used across the application.
6. `shared/types`: Defines shared type definitions used throughout the project.

## Configuration
While the individual components don't have explicit configuration files, they often accept props that allow for customization of the displayed data. Common configurable aspects include:

1. Date range filters
2. Granularity of data (e.g., hourly, daily, weekly)
3. Sorting options for tabular data
4. Thresholds for filtering data (e.g., minimum confidence score)

These configuration options are typically passed down from parent components or derived from application-wide contexts like `DatasetContext` and `OrgContext`.

The components in this directory form a crucial part of the analytics frontend, providing users with valuable insights into search performance and usage patterns. They demonstrate a consistent approach to data fetching, state management, and visualization, leveraging SolidJS's reactivity model and popular charting libraries to create an interactive and informative analytics dashboard.
