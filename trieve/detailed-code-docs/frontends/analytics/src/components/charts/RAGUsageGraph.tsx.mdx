## High-level description
The `RAGUsageGraph` component displays a bar chart that visualizes RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) usage over time. It fetches usage data from an API and renders a chart using Chart.js, allowing users to see the number of RAG requests made within a specified time period and granularity.

## Code Structure
The `RAGUsageGraph` component uses two Solid queries (`usageQuery` and `ragTotalQuery`) to fetch data from the backend API. The `usageQuery` fetches the time-series data for the chart, while `ragTotalQuery` fetches the total number of RAG queries for the selected filter. The component then uses a Solid effect to create and update a Chart.js instance based on the fetched data.

## References
- `DatasetContext`: Provides the currently selected dataset's ID.
- `getRagUsageGraph`: API function to fetch RAG usage data.
- `getRAGUsage`: API function to fetch the total number of RAG queries.
- `ChartCard`: A wrapper component for displaying charts.
- `parseCustomDateString`: Utility function to parse date strings.

## Symbols

### `RAGUsageGraph`
#### Description
A Solid component that renders a bar chart visualizing RAG usage over time.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| props | `RAGUsageProps` | An object containing the filter and granularity for the chart. |

#### Outputs
JSX Element representing the RAG usage graph.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Retrieves dataset ID:** Fetches the currently selected dataset's ID from the `DatasetContext`.
2. **Fetches data:** Uses two Solid queries (`usageQuery` and `ragTotalQuery`) to fetch RAG usage data and total RAG query count from the API based on the provided filter and granularity.
3. **Creates/Updates Chart.js instance:**
   - On the initial render and whenever the data changes, creates a new Chart.js instance if one doesn't exist, or updates the existing one.
   - Configures the chart type as 'bar' and sets up data, labels, and styling.
   - Dynamically adjusts the bar thickness and x-axis offset based on the number of data points.
   - Updates the chart data with fetched usage data and timestamps.
4. **Cleans up Chart.js instance:** Destroys the Chart.js instance when the component unmounts to prevent memory leaks.
5. **Renders chart:** Renders a `ChartCard` component containing the canvas element for the chart and a title. The `ChartCard` also displays the total number of RAG queries fetched by `ragTotalQuery`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @tanstack/solid-query | Used for data fetching and caching. |
| date-fns | Used for date formatting and manipulation. |
| chart.js | Used for rendering the bar chart. |
| chartjs-adapter-date-fns | Adapter for using date-fns with Chart.js. |

## Side Effects
- Fetches data from the backend API.
- Creates, updates, and destroys a Chart.js instance.
- Updates the URL search parameters with the selected dataset ID.
