## High-level description
The `LatencyGraph` component renders a line chart that displays the average latency of searches over time. It fetches latency data based on provided filters and granularity, then dynamically updates a Chart.js instance.

## Code Structure
The `LatencyGraph` component uses the `createQuery` hook from `@tanstack/solid-query` to fetch and manage latency data. It leverages SolidJS's reactive primitives like `createEffect` and `createSignal` to update the chart when data or props change. The `Chart` instance from `chart.js` is responsible for rendering the actual chart.

### `LatencyGraph`
#### Description
A SolidJS component that renders a line chart displaying average search latency over time. It fetches data, configures the chart, and handles updates based on data changes.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| props | `LatencyGraphProps` | An object containing filter and granularity settings for the latency data. |

#### Outputs
Renders a `&lt;canvas&gt;` element containing the latency graph.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Data Fetching:** Uses `createQuery` to fetch latency data based on `props.params` and the selected dataset from `DatasetContext`.
2. **Chart Initialization:** When data and canvas element are available, initializes a `Chart` instance if one doesn't exist.
3. **Chart Configuration:** Configures the chart type, labels, datasets, scales (with date-fns adapter for time-based x-axis), and animation.
4. **Dynamic Updates:** Uses `createEffect` to reactively update the chart data and options whenever `props.params` or `latencyQuery.data` change.
5. **Cleanup:** Uses `onCleanup` to destroy the `Chart` instance when the component unmounts.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @tanstack/solid-query | Used for data fetching and caching. |
| chart.js | Used for rendering the line chart. |
| chartjs-adapter-date-fns | Used for handling date-time values on the chart's x-axis. |
| date-fns | Used for date formatting and manipulation. |

## Error Handling
The `latencyQuery` from `@tanstack/solid-query` handles basic error states during data fetching. If the fetch request fails, it exposes the error through its `error` property, which can be handled by the component.

## Side Effects
- Fetches latency data from an API endpoint.
- Modifies the DOM by rendering and updating a `&lt;canvas&gt;` element.
- Creates and destroys a `Chart.js` instance.
