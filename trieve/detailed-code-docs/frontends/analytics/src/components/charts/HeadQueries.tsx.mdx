## High-level description
The `HeadQueries` component displays a table of the most frequent search queries and their counts, fetched from the backend API. It allows pagination to browse through large result sets and preloads the next page for smoother navigation.

## Code Structure
The `HeadQueries` component uses the `createQuery` hook from `@tanstack/solid-query` to fetch and manage the head queries data. It also utilizes the `usePagination` hook for pagination functionality and the `DatasetContext` to determine the active dataset. The `getHeadQueries` function is called to retrieve data from the API. The component displays the data in a table format using the `Table` component from `shared/ui`.

## References
- `getHeadQueries`: Function to fetch head queries data from the API.
- `DatasetContext`: Provides the active dataset's information.
- `usePagination`: Hook for managing pagination state and actions.
- `Table`, `Td`, `Th`, `Tr`: Components for rendering the table.
- `QueryStringDisplay`: Component to display the search query, potentially with multiple weighted queries.

## Symbols

### `HeadQueries`
#### Description
This component fetches and displays a paginated table of the most frequent search queries and their counts for the selected dataset.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| props | `HeadQueriesProps` | An object containing the following properties: |
| props.params | `{ filter: AnalyticsFilter }` | An object containing filter parameters for the API request. |

#### Outputs
JSX Element representing the Head Queries table.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Retrieves Context:** Accesses the selected dataset from the `DatasetContext`.
2. **Manages Pagination:** Utilizes the `usePagination` hook to handle pagination state and actions.
3. **Fetches Data:**
   - Uses the `createQuery` hook to fetch head queries data based on the provided filters and current page.
   - The `getHeadQueries` function is called to retrieve data from the API.
   - Prefetches the next page of data using `queryClient.prefetchQuery` for smoother navigation.
4. **Displays Data:**
   - Renders a loading state while data is being fetched.
   - Once data is available, renders a `Table` component to display the queries and their counts.
   - If no data is found, displays a "No Data" message.
5. **Pagination Controls:**
   - Renders `PaginationButtons` to allow users to navigate through the paginated results.
