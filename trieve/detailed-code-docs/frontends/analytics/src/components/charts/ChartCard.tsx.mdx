## High-level description
The `ChartCard` component is a reusable UI element that displays content within a card-like container, often used for charts and data visualizations. It provides optional props for a title, subtitle, width, a controller element, and the main content to be displayed within the card.

## Code Structure
The `ChartCard` component is a simple functional component that uses the `splitProps` function to separate class-related props from other props. It then renders a `div` element with the specified styles and classes, including the provided title, subtitle, controller, and children elements.
