### CTRInfoPanel
#### Description
This is a functional component that renders an informational panel about CTR analytics setup. It uses the `useCTRNeedsSetup` hook to determine whether to display the panel.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props.

#### Outputs
Returns a JSX element that conditionally renders an informational panel.

#### Internal Logic
1. The component uses the `useCTRNeedsSetup` hook to get a reactive value indicating whether CTR setup is needed.
2. It uses the `Show` component from Solid.js to conditionally render the panel based on the `ctrNeedsSetup` value.
3. If `ctrNeedsSetup` is true, it renders a div with styling classes and informational text about CTR analytics setup.
4. The panel includes a link to the Analytics API reference for sending CTR data.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| solid-js | Used for the `Show` component, which provides conditional rendering |
| ../hooks/useCTRNeedsSetup | Custom hook to determine if CTR setup is needed |

## References
- The `CTRInfoPanel` component is used in the `OverviewPage` component (from the related code snippet).
- It relies on the `useCTRNeedsSetup` hook, which in turn depends on the `DatasetContext` and makes API calls to get CTR summary information.

## Notes
1. The component uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling, providing a blue-themed informational panel.
2. The conditional rendering ensures that the panel is only shown when CTR setup is needed, avoiding unnecessary UI clutter.
3. The component provides a direct link to the documentation, making it easier for users to find information on setting up CTR analytics.

This component plays a crucial role in guiding users to set up CTR analytics, enhancing the overall user experience of the analytics dashboard by providing timely and relevant information.
