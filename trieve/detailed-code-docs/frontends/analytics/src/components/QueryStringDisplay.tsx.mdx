## High-level description
The `QueryStringDisplay` component renders a search query string. It can handle both single queries and multiple queries with associated weights. For multiple queries, it provides a collapsible view to show/hide the additional queries and their weights.

## Code Structure
The `QueryStringDisplay` component uses the `createMemo` function to parse the input `children` prop and determine the appropriate rendering logic. It utilizes the `zod` library for schema validation and the `Show` component from SolidJS for conditional rendering.

## References
- `queryStyles`: A CSS class name generator function (likely from a styling library like CVA).
- `weight`: Another CSS class name generator function.
- `multiQuerySchema`: A Zod schema for validating an array of query objects with `query` and `weight` properties.
- `cn`: A utility function (likely from a shared utility module) for merging CSS class names.

### `QueryStringDisplay`
#### Description
This component renders a search query string. It can handle both single queries and multiple queries with associated weights.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| children | string | The raw query string to be displayed. |
| size | "default" | "large" | Controls the font size of the displayed query. |

#### Outputs
JSX Element representing the rendered query string.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Parse Input:** Parses the `children` prop, attempting to interpret it as a JSON array if it starts with "[{".
2. **Validate Schema:** If parsed as JSON, validates the array against the `multiQuerySchema` using `zod`.
3. **Render Based on Query Type:**
   - **Single Query:** If a single query is present or the input is not valid JSON, renders the query string directly.
   - **Multiple Queries:** If multiple valid queries are found:
     - Renders the first query and a button to expand/collapse the remaining queries.
     - When expanded, renders all queries with their weights and a button to collapse the view.

#### Performance Considerations
The `createMemo` function ensures that the parsing and rendering logic only runs when the `children` prop changes, optimizing performance.
