## High-level description
This directory contains a collection of React components that form the core of an analytics dashboard for a search and retrieval augmented generation (RAG) system. These components are responsible for fetching, processing, and visualizing various types of analytics data, including search usage, latency, query counts, and RAG-specific metrics.

## What does it do?
The components in this directory work together to create a comprehensive analytics dashboard that provides insights into search performance, usage patterns, and RAG effectiveness. Key functionalities include:

1. Visualizing search usage over time using bar charts
2. Displaying search latency trends with line charts
3. Showing query counts broken down by search type
4. Presenting RAG usage statistics and trends
5. Listing low confidence queries and queries with no results
6. Providing detailed views of individual search events
7. Summarizing click-through rate (CTR) statistics
8. Displaying the most frequent search queries
9. Showing a table of RAG queries with sorting and filtering options

These visualizations help users understand the performance and usage patterns of their search and RAG systems, enabling data-driven decision-making and system optimization.

## Key Files
1. `SearchUsageGraph.tsx`: Renders a bar chart showing search requests over time.
2. `LatencyGraph.tsx`: Displays a line chart of average search latency.
3. `QueryCounts.tsx`: Shows a breakdown of total searches by type.
4. `RAGUsageGraph.tsx`: Visualizes RAG usage over time.
5. `LowConfidenceQueries.tsx`: Lists queries with low confidence scores.
6. `NoResultQueries.tsx`: Displays queries that returned no results.
7. `CTRSummary.tsx`: Provides a summary of click-through rate statistics.
8. `HeadQueries.tsx`: Shows the most frequent search queries.
9. `RagQueries.tsx`: Displays a table of RAG queries with sorting and filtering options.
10. `ChartCard.tsx`: A reusable component for wrapping charts and tables in a consistent card-like container.
11. `QueryStringDisplay.tsx`: A utility component for displaying search query strings, handling multi-query scenarios.

## Dependencies
The components in this directory rely on several key external libraries:

1. `@tanstack/solid-query`: Used for data fetching, caching, and state management.
2. `chart.js`: The primary library for rendering charts and graphs.
3. `chartjs-adapter-date-fns`: An adapter for using date-fns with Chart.js for better date handling on axes.
4. `date-fns`: Used for date formatting and manipulation.
5. `solid-js`: The core library for building the user interface and managing component state.
6. `shared/ui`: A collection of shared UI components used across the application.

These dependencies enable efficient data fetching, state management, and the creation of interactive and visually appealing charts and tables.

## Configuration
The components in this directory don't have specific configuration files. Instead, they rely on props passed from parent components to configure their behavior, such as date ranges, filters, and granularity settings. Many components also use the `DatasetContext` to access the currently selected dataset ID.

This approach allows for flexible and dynamic configuration of the analytics dashboard, enabling users to customize the view based on their specific needs and the selected dataset.
