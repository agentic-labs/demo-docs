## High-level description
The `DataExplorerTabs` component renders a set of navigation tabs for the data explorer section of the application. It dynamically generates tabs based on the `pages` array and highlights the currently active tab based on the URL pathname.

## Code Structure
The `DataExplorerTabs` component uses the `pages` array to define the available tabs. It iterates through the array using the `For` component from SolidJS and renders an `&lt;A&gt;` (anchor) element for each page. The `usePathname` hook is used to determine the current pathname and highlight the active tab. The `useBetterNav` function is used to handle navigation when a tab is clicked.
