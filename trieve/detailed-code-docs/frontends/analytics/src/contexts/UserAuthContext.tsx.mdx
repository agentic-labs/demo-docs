title: "UserAuthContext.tsx"
---

## High-level description
The `UserAuthContextProvider` component in `UserAuthContext.tsx` manages user authentication and authorization for the application. It fetches user data from the API, handles redirects for login, and provides user context to child components. This context is crucial for displaying user-specific data and controlling access to features based on user roles and permissions.

## Code Structure
The `UserAuthContextProvider` component uses the `UserContext` context to share user data with its children. It fetches user data on mount and updates the context, triggering re-renders for components that depend on this information. The `OrgContextProvider` and `TopBarLayout` components are nested within the provider, ensuring they have access to the user context.

## References
- `UserContext`: A context object that holds the user information.
- `SlimUser`: A type definition from "shared/types" representing a simplified user object.
- `OrgContextProvider`: A component that provides organization context.
- `TopBarLayout`: A layout component that likely uses the user context.
- `apiHost`: A utility function to get the API base URL.

## Symbols

### `UserContext`
#### Description
A SolidJS context object that stores and provides the authenticated user's information to the application.

### `UserContextType`
#### Description
A TypeScript type definition that defines the structure of the user context object. It includes a single property:

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| user | Accessor&lt;SlimUser&gt; | A SolidJS accessor that provides the `SlimUser` object representing the logged-in user. |

### `UserAuthContextProvider`
#### Description
A SolidJS component that manages the authentication state of the user and provides the user information to its children components through the `UserContext`.

#### Inputs
This component does not accept any specific props.

#### Outputs
This component renders its children within a `UserContext.Provider` if the user is logged in. Otherwise, it conditionally renders nothing using the `Show` component.

#### Internal Logic
1. **State Initialization:**
    - `userInfo`: A SolidJS signal initialized with `null`, representing the user's information. It will be populated after successful login.
2. **Login Function (`login`):**
    - An asynchronous function that attempts to fetch user data from the `/auth/me` endpoint.
    - If the response status is 401 (Unauthorized), it redirects the user to the login page (`/auth`) with a redirect URI pointing back to the current origin.
    - If the response is successful, it parses the response JSON as a `SlimUser` object and updates the `userInfo` signal.
3. **Mount Effect:**
    - When the component mounts, it immediately calls the `login` function to attempt authentication.
4. **Conditional Rendering:**
    - The component uses the `Show` component to conditionally render its children.
    - If `userInfo()` returns a truthy value (indicating a logged-in user), it renders the following:
        - `UserContext.Provider`: Provides the `userInfo` to its children.
        - `OrgContextProvider`: A component that likely uses the user information to fetch and manage organization-related data.
        - `TopBarLayout`: A layout component that likely uses the user information to display user-specific UI elements.

## Side Effects
- **Redirects:** The `login` function redirects the user to the login page if the user is not authenticated.
- **API Calls:** The `login` function makes an API call to fetch user data.

## Dependencies
- `solid-js`: A declarative JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- `shared/types`: A module that exports shared type definitions, including `SlimUser`.
- `../utils/apiHost`: A module that exports the API base URL.
- `./OrgContext`: A module that exports the `OrgContextProvider` component.
- `../layouts/TopBarLayout`: A module that exports the `TopBarLayout` component.

## Error Handling
- **Unauthorized (401) Response:** The `login` function handles 401 responses from the API by redirecting the user to the login page.

## Logging
The code does not implement any specific logging mechanisms.
