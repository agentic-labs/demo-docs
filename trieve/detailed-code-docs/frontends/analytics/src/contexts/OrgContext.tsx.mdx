title: "OrgContext.tsx"
---

## High-level description
The `OrgContext.tsx` file defines a SolidJS context, `OrgContext`, for managing the currently selected organization within the analytics frontend. It handles selecting an organization from the user's available organizations and persists the selection in the URL parameters.

## Code Structure
The `OrgContextProvider` component uses the `OrgContext` to provide the `selectedOrg` signal and the `selectOrg` function to its children. The `selectedOrg` signal holds the currently active organization, while `selectOrg` updates this signal and the URL parameters.

## References
- `Organization` and `SlimUser` types from "shared/types"
- `redirect` and `useSearchParams` from "@solidjs/router"
- Various SolidJS primitives like `Accessor`, `Context`, `createContext`, `createSignal`, `ParentProps`, and `Show`

## Symbols

### `OrgDatasetContextProps`
#### Description
An interface defining the props expected by the `OrgContextProvider` component. It extends the `ParentProps` interface from SolidJS.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| user | SlimUser | The currently logged-in user, containing information about their organizations. |

### `OrgContextType`
#### Description
An interface defining the shape of the context object provided by `OrgContext`.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| selectedOrg | Accessor&lt;Organization&gt; | A SolidJS accessor providing access to the currently selected organization. |
| selectOrg | (orgId: string) =&gt; void | A function to update the selected organization. |

### `OrgContext`
#### Description
A SolidJS context object created using `createContext`. It is used to share the selected organization state across the application.

### `OrgContextProvider`
#### Description
A SolidJS component that acts as a provider for the `OrgContext`. It wraps its children and makes the context available to them.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| props | OrgDatasetContextProps | The props for the component, including the currently logged-in user. |

#### Internal Logic
1. **Initialization:**
   - Retrieves URL parameters using `useSearchParams`.
   - Defines `getInitialUserOrg` to determine the initial organization to be selected.
     - If the user has no organizations, redirects to an error page.
     - If the URL has an `organization` parameter, selects the corresponding organization from the user's organizations or defaults to the first organization.
     - Otherwise, sets the `organization` parameter in the URL to the ID of the user's first organization and selects it.
   - Creates a signal `selectedOrg` initialized with the result of `getInitialUserOrg`.

2. **`setSelectedOrgWithParams` function:**
   - Takes an `orgId` as input.
   - Finds the corresponding organization from the user's organizations.
   - Redirects to an error page if the organization is not found.
   - Updates the `selectedOrg` signal with the found organization.
   - Updates the URL parameter `organization` with the selected organization's ID.

3. **Rendering:**
   - Provides the `selectedOrg` signal and `setSelectedOrgWithParams` function through the `OrgContext.Provider`.
   - Conditionally renders its children using `Show` only when `selectedOrg` has a truthy value.

## Side Effects
- Modifies the URL parameters by setting and updating the `organization` parameter.
- Redirects to `/error` if the user has no organizations or if an invalid organization ID is provided.
