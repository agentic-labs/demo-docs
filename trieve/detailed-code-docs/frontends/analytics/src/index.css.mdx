### Tailwind CSS Directives
#### Description
The file includes three Tailwind CSS directives that import the base styles, component styles, and utility classes from the Tailwind CSS framework.

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

These directives are used to include the full set of Tailwind CSS styles in the project, allowing for rapid UI development using utility classes.

### .debug Class
#### Description
A custom CSS class named `debug` is defined to add a visual aid for development and debugging purposes.

```css
.debug {
  outline: 1px solid red;
}
```

This class adds a thin red outline to any element it's applied to, making it easier to visualize element boundaries and layout issues during development.
