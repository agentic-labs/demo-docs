## High-level description
The `usePathname` hook provides a reactive way to access the current pathname of the URL in a SolidJS application. It uses the `useLocation` hook from `solid-js/router` to get the current location object and then extracts the `pathname` property using a memo.

## Symbols

### `usePathname`
#### Description
This hook returns a reactive signal containing the current pathname of the URL.

#### Inputs
This hook takes no inputs.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `pathname` | `Accessor&lt;string&gt;` | A reactive signal containing the current pathname of the URL. |

#### Internal Logic
1. It uses the `useLocation` hook from `solid-js/router` to get the current location object.
2. It uses `createMemo` from `solid-js` to create a memoized signal that extracts and returns the `pathname` property from the `location` object. This ensures that the `pathname` signal is only updated when the `location` object changes.
