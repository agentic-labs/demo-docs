## High-level description
The `usePathname` function is a custom hook in a SolidJS application that provides access to the current pathname (URL path) of the application. It uses the `useLocation` hook from SolidJS Router and creates a memoized value of the pathname, which improves performance by preventing unnecessary re-renders.

## References
- `@solidjs/router`: This hook utilizes the `useLocation` hook from the SolidJS Router library to retrieve the current location object.
- `solid-js`: This hook utilizes the `createMemo` function from the SolidJS library to create a memoized value.

### `usePathname`
#### Description
This is a custom hook that returns a reactive signal containing the current pathname of the application. It retrieves the pathname from the `location` object provided by `useLocation` and memoizes it using `createMemo` for performance optimization.

#### Inputs
This hook does not accept any inputs.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| pathname | Accessor&lt;string\&gt; | A reactive signal containing the current pathname (URL path) of the application. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the current `location` object using the `useLocation` hook from SolidJS Router.
2. Creates a memoized value of `location.pathname` using `createMemo`. This ensures that the pathname is only recalculated when the `location` object changes, improving performance.
3. Returns the memoized `pathname` signal.

#### Performance Considerations
The use of `createMemo` optimizes performance by preventing unnecessary re-renders. The `pathname` signal will only be updated when the `location` object changes, ensuring that components depending on the pathname are only re-rendered when necessary.
