## High-level description
This directory contains API client functions for interacting with the Trieve analytics backend. It provides a set of functions to fetch various types of analytics data, including search usage, latency, query performance, click-through rates, and trending topics.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory enables the analytics frontend to communicate with the backend API and retrieve data for visualization and analysis. It handles the following main functionalities:

1. Fetching search analytics data, including usage graphs, latency information, and query statistics.
2. Retrieving RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) analytics, such as usage data and query events.
3. Getting click-through rate (CTR) summaries for search results.
4. Fetching search query data for tabular display.
5. Retrieving trending topics and related queries for data visualization.

These functions abstract away the complexities of API communication, allowing other parts of the application to easily request and use analytics data.

## Key Files

### analytics.ts
This file contains the core analytics API functions, including:
- `getLatency`: Retrieves latency data points for a given dataset and time range.
- `getRpsUsageGraph`: Fetches search usage data points.
- `getHeadQueries`: Gets the most frequent search queries.
- `getRAGQueries` and `getRAGUsage`: Retrieve RAG-related analytics data.
- `getLowConfidenceQueries` and `getNoResultQueries`: Fetch specific types of problematic queries.
- `getQueryCounts`: Retrieves total query counts for different search types and methods.
- `getSearchQuery`: Gets detailed information about a specific search query event.

### ctr.ts
This file focuses on click-through rate analytics:
- `getSearchCTRSummary`: Fetches search CTR summary data for a given dataset.

### tables.ts
This file provides functionality for retrieving search query data for tabular display:
- `getSearchQueries`: Retrieves search queries based on various parameters for table population.

### trends.ts
This file handles trending topics and related queries:
- `getTrendsBubbles`: Fetches a list of trending topics (clusters) for a dataset.
- `getQueriesForTopic`: Retrieves search queries associated with a specific trending topic.

## Dependencies
The API functions rely on the following key dependencies:
- `shared/types`: Provides type definitions for various data structures used in API requests and responses.
- `../utils/apiHost`: Exports the base URL for the Trieve API.
- `../utils/formatDate`: Offers utility functions for formatting dates in API requests.

## Configuration
The API functions use the following configuration:
- API base URL: Imported from `../utils/apiHost`.
- Dataset ID: Passed as a parameter to most functions or set in the `TR-Dataset` header.
- Authentication: Requests include credentials (`credentials: "include"`), suggesting cookie-based authentication.

The API functions are designed to be flexible, often accepting filter parameters, pagination options, and other configuration settings to customize the data retrieval process.

Code Example:
```typescript
// Fetching latency data
const latencyData = await getLatency({
  startDate: new Date('2023-01-01'),
  endDate: new Date('2023-12-31'),
  searchMethod: 'semantic',
  searchType: 'search'
}, 'hour', 'dataset-123');

// Retrieving trending topics
const trendingTopics = await getTrendsBubbles('dataset-123');

// Getting CTR summary
const ctrSummary = await getSearchCTRSummary('dataset-123', {
  startDate: new Date('2023-01-01'),
  endDate: new Date('2023-12-31')
});
```

This API client layer provides a clean and type-safe interface for the frontend to interact with the analytics backend, enabling the creation of rich, data-driven visualizations and reports.
