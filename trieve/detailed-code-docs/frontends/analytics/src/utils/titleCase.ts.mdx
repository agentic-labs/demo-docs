## High-level description
This code defines a utility function `toTitleCase` that converts a given string to title case format. It's a simple yet useful function for text formatting, particularly in user interfaces where consistent capitalization is desired.

## Symbols

### `toTitleCase`
#### Description
The `toTitleCase` function takes a string input and converts it to title case. It capitalizes the first letter of each word while making the rest of the letters lowercase.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| str | string | The input string to be converted to title case |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| (return value) | string | The input string converted to title case |

#### Internal Logic
1. The function uses a regular expression `/\w\S*/g` to match words in the input string.
2. For each matched word, it applies the following transformation:
   - Capitalizes the first character using `charAt(0).toUpperCase()`
   - Converts the rest of the word to lowercase using `substring(1).toLowerCase()`
3. The `replace` method is used to apply this transformation to all matched words in the string.

## References
The `toTitleCase` function is used in several other parts of the codebase:

1. In `QueryCounts.tsx`, it's used to format the `search_method` for display.
2. In `FilterBar.tsx`, it's used to format options in the search method and search type dropdowns.
3. In `TrendExplorer.tsx`, it's used to format the `search_type` in the `SearchQueryEventModal`.

These usages demonstrate that the function is primarily employed for improving the readability and consistency of displayed text in the user interface.

## Dependencies
The function doesn't rely on any external libraries or modules. It uses native JavaScript string methods and regular expressions.

## Performance Considerations
The function uses a regular expression with the global flag, which means it will process the entire input string. For very long strings, this could potentially impact performance. However, for typical use cases (such as formatting short titles or labels), the performance impact should be negligible.
