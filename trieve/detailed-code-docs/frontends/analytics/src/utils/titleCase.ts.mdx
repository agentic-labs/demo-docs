### `toTitleCase`
#### Description
This function takes a string as input and returns a new string transformed to title case. It achieves this by using a regular expression to identify word boundaries and then capitalizing the first letter of each word while lowercasing the rest.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| str | string | The input string to be converted to title case. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| (return value) | string | The input string converted to title case. |

#### Internal Logic
1. The function uses the `replace` method with a regular expression `/\w\S*/g` to match words. This regex looks for a word character (`\w`) followed by zero or more non-whitespace characters (`\S*`).
2. For each match, the function uses an arrow function to transform the matched text.
3. Inside the arrow function:
    - `text.charAt(0).toUpperCase()` extracts the first character of the matched text and converts it to uppercase.
    - `text.substring(1).toLowerCase()` extracts the remaining characters of the matched text (from the second character onwards) and converts them to lowercase.
4. The `replace` method then replaces the original matched text with the transformed text, effectively converting the input string to title case.

## Side Effects
This function has no side effects. It operates solely on the input string and returns a new string without modifying any external state.
