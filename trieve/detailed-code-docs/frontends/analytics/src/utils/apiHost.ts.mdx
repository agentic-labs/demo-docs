## References
The `apiHost` constant is used in several other files within the project:

1. In `TopBarLayout.tsx`, it's used to construct URLs for fetching datasets and handling authentication redirects.
2. In `analytics.ts`, it's used as the base URL for various analytics API endpoints.
3. In `UserAuthContext.tsx`, it's used for authentication-related API calls and redirects.
