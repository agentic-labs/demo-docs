title: "apiHost.ts"
---

## High-level description
This code defines a single variable, `apiHost`, which stores the base URL of the API used by the application. It retrieves this URL from an environment variable named `VITE_API_HOST` that is injected during the build process.

## References
- `import.meta.env`: A built-in object in JavaScript modules that provides access to environment variables.

## Symbols

### `apiHost`
#### Description
This variable stores the base URL of the API as a string. It is used to construct the full URL for various API endpoints throughout the application.

#### Inputs
This symbol does not take any inputs.

#### Outputs
This symbol does not return any outputs.

#### Internal Logic
The code uses `import.meta.env.VITE_API_HOST` to access the value of the `VITE_API_HOST` environment variable. This value is then cast to a string and assigned to the `apiHost` variable.

## Side Effects
This code has the side effect of defining a global variable `apiHost` that holds the API base URL.

## Dependencies
This code does not have any external library dependencies.

## Configuration
This code relies on the `VITE_API_HOST` environment variable being set during the build process. This variable should contain the base URL of the API.
