## High-level description
The `useBetterNav` function is a custom navigation hook for SolidJS applications. It provides a way to navigate to different routes while preserving existing query parameters. This is particularly useful for maintaining application state when navigating between different views or sections.

## Symbols
### `useBetterNav`
#### Description
This function is a custom hook that returns a navigation function. The returned function takes a pathname as input and navigates to that pathname while preserving existing query parameters.

#### Inputs
None. This is a hook, not a function.

#### Outputs
A function with the following signature:
```typescript
(pathname: string) =&gt; void
```
This function takes a `pathname` string as input and navigates to that path, preserving existing query parameters.

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the current query parameters using `useSearchParams`.
2. Creates a new `URLSearchParams` object from the current query parameters.
3. Constructs the new URL by appending the query parameters to the provided `pathname`.
4. Uses the `navigate` function from `@solidjs/router` to navigate to the constructed URL.

#### Example Usage
```typescript
const navigate = useBetterNav();

// Navigate to "/analytics" while preserving query parameters
navigate('/analytics');
```
