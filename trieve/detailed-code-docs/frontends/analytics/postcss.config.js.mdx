## High-level description
This file is a configuration for PostCSS, a tool for transforming CSS with JavaScript. It sets up two plugins: Tailwind CSS and Autoprefixer, which are commonly used for modern CSS development and browser compatibility.

## Symbols

### Default Export
#### Description
The file exports a default configuration object for PostCSS. This object specifies the plugins to be used in the PostCSS processing pipeline.

#### Inputs
This configuration doesn't take any inputs as it's a static object.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| default export | Object | A configuration object for PostCSS |

#### Internal Logic
The configuration object contains a single property `plugins`, which is an object with two entries:
1. `tailwindcss`: An empty object (`{}`) is provided as the configuration for Tailwind CSS. This means Tailwind CSS will use its default configuration.
2. `autoprefixer`: An empty object (`{}`) is provided as the configuration for Autoprefixer. This means Autoprefixer will use its default settings.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| tailwindcss | A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces |
| autoprefixer | A PostCSS plugin to parse CSS and add vendor prefixes to CSS rules |

Note: While these dependencies are referenced in the configuration, they need to be installed separately in the project.

## Configuration
This file itself serves as a configuration for PostCSS. The configuration is minimal and relies on the default settings of both Tailwind CSS and Autoprefixer.

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| tailwindcss | Object | {} | Configuration for Tailwind CSS (using defaults) |
| autoprefixer | Object | {} | Configuration for Autoprefixer (using defaults) |
