title: "tsconfig.json"
---

## High-level description
This file (`tsconfig.json`) is a configuration file for TypeScript in the `analytics` frontend of the project. It extends a base configuration from `config/tsconfig` and overrides or adds specific settings for this directory. The main functionality is to configure the TypeScript compiler for the `analytics` frontend code located in the `src` directory. 

## References
- `config/tsconfig`: This file is referenced using the `"extends"` property, indicating that it provides base TypeScript configurations.

## Symbols
### `tsconfig.json`
#### Description
This JSON object defines the TypeScript compiler options for the `analytics` frontend. It inherits settings from a base configuration and customizes some aspects for this specific part of the codebase.

#### Inputs
This file does not take any direct inputs. It is read by the TypeScript compiler.

#### Outputs
This file does not produce any direct outputs. It configures the behavior of the TypeScript compiler.

#### Internal Logic
- `"extends": "config/tsconfig"`: This line indicates that the configurations from the file located at `config/tsconfig` should be extended. This allows for a centralized configuration management and avoids repetition.
- `"compilerOptions": { "noUnusedLocals": false }`: This section overrides the `"noUnusedLocals"` compiler option from the base configuration. Setting it to `false` disables the check for unused local variables within the `analytics` frontend code.
- `"include": [ "src" ]`: This specifies that the TypeScript compiler should include files within the `src` directory for compilation.

## Dependencies
This configuration file implicitly depends on the TypeScript compiler.

## Configuration
This file itself acts as a configuration for the TypeScript compiler. The specific options and their meanings can be found in the TypeScript compiler options documentation: [https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig)
