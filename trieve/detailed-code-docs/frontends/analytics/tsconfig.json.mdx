title: "tsconfig.json"
---

## High-level description
This file is a TypeScript configuration file (`tsconfig.json`) specifically for the analytics frontend of the project. It extends a base configuration and specifies compiler options and source file inclusion for the TypeScript compiler.

## Code Structure
The configuration is structured as a JSON object with three main properties: `extends`, `compilerOptions`, and `include`.

## Symbols

### `extends`
#### Description
This property specifies that the current configuration extends another TypeScript configuration file.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| extends | string | Path to the base configuration file |

The value "config/tsconfig" indicates that this configuration extends a base configuration located at "config/tsconfig".

### `compilerOptions`
#### Description
This property specifies compiler options that override or add to the options from the extended configuration.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| noUnusedLocals | boolean | Compiler option to disable unused local variable checks |

In this case, `noUnusedLocals` is set to `false`, which means the TypeScript compiler will not report errors for unused local variables in the analytics frontend code.

### `include`
#### Description
This property specifies which files or directories should be included in the compilation process.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| include | array of strings | Paths or globs indicating which files to include |

The value `["src"]` indicates that all TypeScript files in the "src" directory (and its subdirectories) should be included in the compilation process.

## Dependencies
This configuration file depends on the existence of a base TypeScript configuration file located at "config/tsconfig".

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| noUnusedLocals | boolean | false | Disables reporting of errors for unused local variables |

Note: Other configuration options may be present in the extended "config/tsconfig" file, but are not visible in this specific configuration.
