This declaration file doesn't contain any implementation details. It serves as a type definition for the Vite configuration, allowing TypeScript to understand the structure of the configuration object exported from the corresponding JavaScript file (likely named `vite.config.js` or `vite.config.ts`).

The actual configuration details would be found in the JavaScript or TypeScript implementation file. This declaration file ensures that when other parts of the project import the Vite configuration, they have access to proper type information, enabling better type checking and IDE support.
