title: "tsconfig.json"
---

## High-level description
This file is a TypeScript configuration file (`tsconfig.json`) for the search frontend of the project. It extends a base configuration and specifies compiler options and source file inclusion for the TypeScript compiler.

## Code Structure
The configuration is structured as a JSON object with three main properties: `extends`, `compilerOptions`, and `include`.

## Symbols

### `extends`
#### Description
This property specifies that the current configuration extends another TypeScript configuration file.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| extends | string | Path to the base configuration file |

The value `"config/tsconfig"` indicates that this configuration extends a base configuration located at `config/tsconfig.json` (or `config/tsconfig.js`).

### `compilerOptions`
#### Description
This object specifies compiler options that override or add to the options from the extended configuration.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| noUnusedLocals | boolean | Compiler option to disable unused local variable checks |

In this case, `noUnusedLocals` is set to `false`, which turns off the TypeScript compiler's checks for unused local variables.

### `include`
#### Description
This property specifies an array of file or directory patterns to be included in the compilation.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| include | string[] | Array of file or directory patterns to include |

The value `["src"]` indicates that all TypeScript files in the `src` directory (and its subdirectories) should be included in the compilation.

## Dependencies
This configuration file depends on the base configuration file located at `config/tsconfig`.

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| noUnusedLocals | boolean | false | Disables the TypeScript compiler's checks for unused local variables |

Note: The default value for `noUnusedLocals` is typically `true` in strict configurations, but it's explicitly set to `false` here.
