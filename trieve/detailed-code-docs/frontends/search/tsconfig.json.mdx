title: "tsconfig.json"
---

## High-level description
This file is a TypeScript configuration file (`tsconfig.json`) specifically for the search frontend of the project. It extends a base configuration and includes some custom settings for the TypeScript compiler.

## Code Structure
The configuration is a JSON object with three main properties: `extends`, `compilerOptions`, and `include`.

## Symbols

### extends
#### Description
This property specifies that the current configuration extends another TypeScript configuration file.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| extends | string | Path to the base configuration file |

The value "config/tsconfig" indicates that this configuration extends a base configuration located at "config/tsconfig".

### compilerOptions
#### Description
This property specifies compiler options that are specific to this frontend.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| noUnusedLocals | boolean | Determines whether to report errors on unused local variables |

In this case, `noUnusedLocals` is set to `false`, which means the TypeScript compiler will not report errors for unused local variables in the search frontend.

### include
#### Description
This property specifies which files should be included in the compilation.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| include | array of strings | Glob patterns for files to include in compilation |

The value `["src"]` indicates that all TypeScript files in the `src` directory (and its subdirectories) should be included in the compilation process.

## Dependencies
This configuration file depends on the base TypeScript configuration file located at "config/tsconfig".

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| noUnusedLocals | boolean | false | Disables reporting of errors for unused local variables |

Note: The `false` value for `noUnusedLocals` is specific to this frontend and may override the setting in the base configuration.
