title: "vite.config.ts"
---

## High-level description
This file, `vite.config.ts`, configures Vite for a Solid.js project with runtime environment support. It defines the build and development settings for the "search" frontend application of the Trieve Search project.

## Code Structure
The configuration is created using `defineConfig` from Vite and includes two plugins: `solid` for Solid.js support and `runtimeEnv` for runtime environment variable handling.

## Symbols

### `defineConfig`
#### Description
`defineConfig` is a utility function from Vite used to define the configuration object with proper TypeScript typing.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| config | Object | Configuration options for Vite |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| config | Object | Typed Vite configuration object |

### `plugins` array
#### Description
An array of Vite plugins used in the project.

#### Internal Logic
1. `solid()`: Initializes the Solid.js plugin for Vite, enabling Solid.js component compilation and hot module replacement.
2. `runtimeEnv()`: Initializes the runtime environment plugin, allowing the use of environment variables at runtime in the browser.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| vite | Build tool and development server |
| vite-plugin-solid | Solid.js integration for Vite |
| vite-plugin-runtime-env | Runtime environment variable support |

## Additional Context
From the related `package.json` file, we can infer:

1. This is a TypeScript project (`.ts` extension and TypeScript dependencies).
2. It uses Solid.js as the frontend framework.
3. The project includes development scripts for running, building, and linting the application.
4. It uses Tailwind CSS for styling.
5. ESLint and Prettier are used for code linting and formatting.
6. The project is part of a larger application called "Trieve Search" (https://search.trieve.ai).

The Vite configuration in this file is minimal, focusing on essential plugins for Solid.js development. Additional configuration options like build output, server settings, or environment variable handling are not explicitly defined here, suggesting that default Vite settings are used for these aspects.
