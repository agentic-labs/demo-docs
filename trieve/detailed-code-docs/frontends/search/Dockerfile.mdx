title: "Dockerfile"
---

## High-level description
This Dockerfile defines a multi-stage build process for a search frontend application. It builds the application using Node.js and then creates a lightweight Nginx-based image to serve the static files. The final image includes custom Nginx configuration and a script to inject environment variables into the HTML file at runtime.

## Code Structure
The Dockerfile consists of two main stages:
1. Build stage: Uses Node.js to build the search frontend application.
2. Production stage: Uses Nginx to serve the built static files.

## Symbols

### Build Stage
#### Description
This stage sets up the Node.js environment, copies the necessary files, and builds the search frontend application.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses `node:18` as the base image
2. Sets the working directory to `/app`
3. Copies package files, yarn lock, and turbo configuration
4. Copies frontend and client SDK files
5. Installs dependencies using yarn
6. Builds the search frontend using the turbo build system

### Production Stage
#### Description
This stage creates a lightweight Nginx-based image to serve the built static files.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses `nginx:1.25.4-alpine-slim` as the base image
2. Copies the built files from the build stage to the Nginx HTML directory
3. Adds a custom Nginx configuration for serving single-page applications
4. Adds a script to inject environment variables into the HTML file at runtime
5. Sets execute permissions for the injection script
6. Exposes port 80 for web traffic

### Nginx Configuration
#### Description
Custom Nginx configuration to serve the single-page application correctly.

#### Internal Logic
- Listens on port 80
- Sets the root directory to `/usr/share/nginx/html`
- Configures URL handling to support client-side routing

### Environment Variable Injection Script
#### Description
A shell script that injects environment variables into the HTML file at container startup.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a template from the original index.html
2. Uses `envsubst` to replace environment variables in the template
3. Overwrites the original index.html with the processed version
4. Removes the temporary template file

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Node.js | Used for building the frontend application |
| Nginx | Used to serve the static files in production |
| yarn | Package manager for installing dependencies |
| turbo | Build system for the frontend application |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| PORT | number | 80 | The port on which Nginx listens |

## Error Handling
The Dockerfile does not implement specific error handling mechanisms beyond the default behavior of the used tools and commands.

## Performance Considerations
- The multi-stage build process helps to keep the final image size small by excluding build tools and dependencies.
- Using Nginx to serve static files provides good performance for serving the frontend application.
- The Alpine-based Nginx image further reduces the final image size.
