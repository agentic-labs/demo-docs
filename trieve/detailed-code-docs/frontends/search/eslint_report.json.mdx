## High-level description
This file contains the ESLint report for the Trieve search frontend project. It lists the linting results for various TypeScript and JavaScript files in the project, including errors, warnings, and suppressed messages.

## Code Structure
The file contains an array of objects, each representing the linting results for a specific file in the project. Each object includes information such as the file path, error counts, warning counts, and any linting messages or suppressed messages.

### Array of ESLint Report Objects
#### Description
The main content of the file is an array of objects, each representing the ESLint report for a single file in the project.

#### Internal Logic
Each object in the array contains the following key information:
- `filePath`: The path to the file that was linted
- `messages`: An array of linting messages (errors or warnings)
- `suppressedMessages`: An array of suppressed linting messages
- `errorCount`: The total number of errors found
- `warningCount`: The total number of warnings found
- `fixableErrorCount`: The number of fixable errors
- `fixableWarningCount`: The number of fixable warnings

#### Performance Considerations
The size of this array can grow large for projects with many files, potentially impacting performance if the report needs to be processed or displayed in its entirety.

## Dependencies
This file is likely generated by ESLint and does not have direct dependencies within the codebase.

## Error Handling
The file itself doesn't implement error handling, but it reports on errors and warnings found during the linting process.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in this file. However, the presence of errors or warnings in the report may indicate areas of the code that need attention or refactoring.
