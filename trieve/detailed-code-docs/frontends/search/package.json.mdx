## High-level description
This package.json file defines the configuration and dependencies for the "search" frontend application of the Trieve project. It includes scripts for development, building, and linting, as well as a list of dependencies and devDependencies required for the project.

## Dependencies
The project relies on several key libraries:

2. Tailwind CSS for styling
3. ESLint and Prettier for code linting and formatting
4. Vite for building and development
5. TypeScript for type checking
6. Various utility libraries like sanitize-html and @nozbe/microfuzz

## Scripts
The package includes several npm scripts:

- `dev`: Starts the development server using Vite
- `build`: Compiles TypeScript and builds the project using Vite
- `preview`: Previews the built project
- `lint`: Runs Prettier and ESLint to format and lint the code
- `lint:only`: Runs only ESLint
