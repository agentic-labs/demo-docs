#### Internal Logic
The manifest file defines the following key properties:

1. Theme and appearance:

   - `background_color`: Sets the background color to a golden hue (#d0a65b).

2. Display and scope:
   - `display`: Set to "standalone", indicating the app should run in its own window, separate from the browser.
   - `scope`: Defines the navigational scope of the app as "/", meaning it covers the entire domain.
   - `start_url`: Specifies the starting URL of the app as "/", which is the root of the domain.

3. App identity:
   - `name`: The full name of the app, "Trieve Search".
   - `short_name`: A shorter name for the app, also "Trieve Search".
   - `description`: A brief description of the app's functionality.

4. Icons:
   - Defines two icons for the app, to be used in different contexts and device resolutions.
   - Both icons are PNG images hosted on a CDN (cdn.trieve.ai).
   - The icons are provided in two sizes: 192x192 pixels and 512x512 pixels.

## API/Interface Reference
While not an API in the traditional sense, the manifest file provides an interface for web browsers and operating systems to understand how to display and integrate the web application. The icons section, in particular, defines resources that can be used by the OS:

| Resource | Size | URL | Description |
|:---------|:-----|:----|:------------|
| Icon | 192x192 | https://cdn.trieve.ai/android-chrome-192x192.png | Smaller app icon for various contexts |
| Icon | 512x512 | https://cdn.trieve.ai/android-chrome-512x512.png | Larger app icon for high-resolution displays |
