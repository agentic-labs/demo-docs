## High-level description
This file, `sw.js`, is a Service Worker script for the search frontend. It sets up event listeners for the three main Service Worker lifecycle events: install, activate, and fetch. However, the current implementation does not perform any actions for these events.

## Symbols

### `self.addEventListener("install", (event) =&gt; {...})`
#### Description
This event listener is triggered when the Service Worker is being installed.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| event | InstallEvent | The install event object |

#### Internal Logic
Currently, this event listener does not perform any actions.

### `self.addEventListener("activate", (event) =&gt; {...})`
#### Description
This event listener is triggered when the Service Worker is being activated.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| event | ActivateEvent | The activate event object |

#### Internal Logic
Currently, this event listener does not perform any actions.

### `self.addEventListener("fetch", (event) =&gt; {...})`
#### Description
This event listener is triggered when the Service Worker intercepts a fetch request from the web application.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| event | FetchEvent | The fetch event object |

#### Internal Logic
Currently, this event listener does not perform any actions.

## TODOs
While not explicitly stated in the code, the empty event listeners suggest that there are plans to implement functionality for these Service Worker events in the future. Potential implementations could include:

1. For the "install" event: Caching static assets for offline use.
2. For the "activate" event: Cleaning up old caches or performing migrations.
3. For the "fetch" event: Intercepting network requests and serving cached responses when offline or implementing custom caching strategies.
