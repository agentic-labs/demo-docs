## High-level description
The `frontends/search/public` directory contains static assets and configuration files for the Trieve Search application's frontend. These files are crucial for the application's appearance, offline capabilities, and how it is handled by web browsers, especially when installed as a Progressive Web App (PWA).

## What does it do?
This directory houses the files that dictate how the Trieve Search application is presented to the end user and how it interacts with the web browser. The `manifest.json` file acts as a configuration file for the application when it is loaded in a web browser. It defines things like the application's name, icons, theme colors, and how it should be displayed (e.g., standalone window vs. browser tab). The `sw.js` file is a Service Worker, which acts like a background process for the application, potentially enabling features like offline access and push notifications.

## Key Files
### manifest.json
This file is a JSON-formatted manifest that provides information about the Trieve Search web application to the browser. It specifies details such as the app's name, icons, display mode, theme colors, and the start URL. This file is essential for the application to be installable as a PWA.

### sw.js
This file contains the JavaScript code for the application's Service Worker. Currently, it doesn't implement any specific actions but is prepared to handle the 'install', 'activate', and 'fetch' events. In a more built-out implementation, this file would likely handle caching strategies, offline content access, and other background operations.
