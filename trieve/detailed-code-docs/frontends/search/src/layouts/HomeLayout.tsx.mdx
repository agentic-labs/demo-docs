## High-level description
The `HomeLayout.tsx` file defines the `Home` component, which serves as the main layout for the search functionality of the application. It handles theme management, service worker registration, and renders the main search interface along with a toast notification system.

## Code Structure
The `Home` component is the main export of this file. It initializes the theme, sets up the service worker, and renders the `HomeSearch` and `ShowToast` components.

## References
- `HomeSearch` from "../HomeSearch"
- `ShowToast` from "../components/ShowToasts"

### `Home`
#### Description
The `Home` component is a functional component that sets up the theme, registers a service worker, and renders the main search interface with toast notifications.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props.

#### Outputs
Returns a JSX element containing the `HomeSearch` and `ShowToast` components.

#### Internal Logic
1. Theme Management:
   - Determines the theme based on local storage or system preferences.
   - Applies the theme by adding or removing the "dark" class from the document's root element.

2. Service Worker Registration:
   - Checks if service workers are supported by the browser.
   - Registers the service worker file ("/sw.js") when the window loads.
   - Logs the registration status (success or failure) to the console.

3. Rendering:
   - Returns a fragment containing the `HomeSearch` and `ShowToast` components.

## Side Effects
- Modifies the `classList` of the `document.documentElement` based on the determined theme.
- Registers a service worker if supported by the browser.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| React | Implied by the use of JSX and functional components |
| "../components/ShowToasts" | Imports the ShowToast component |
| "../HomeSearch" | Imports the HomeSearch component |

## Error Handling
The service worker registration includes basic error handling, logging any registration failures to the console.

## Performance Considerations
The theme determination and service worker registration are performed only once when the component mounts, which is efficient. However, the theme logic runs on every render, which could be optimized by moving it to a useEffect hook or a custom hook if frequent re-renders are expected.
