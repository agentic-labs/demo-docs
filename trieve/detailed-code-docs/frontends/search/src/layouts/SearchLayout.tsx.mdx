### SearchLayout
#### Description
A functional component that serves as a layout wrapper for search-related pages.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| props | { children: JSX.Element } | The child elements to be rendered within the layout |

#### Internal Logic
1. Determines the theme (light or dark) based on local storage or system preferences.
2. Applies the theme by adding or removing the 'dark' class from the document element.
3. Registers a service worker if supported by the browser.
4. Renders a flex container with the Navbar, children, and ShowToast components.

## Side Effects
- Modifies the `classList` of the `document.documentElement` based on the determined theme.
- Registers a service worker if supported by the browser.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Navbar | Renders the navigation bar |
| ShowToast | Displays toast notifications |
| solid-js | Provides JSX types |

## Error Handling
The code includes basic error handling for service worker registration, logging any errors to the console.

## Performance Considerations
The theme determination logic runs on every render, which could be optimized by moving it to a effect or memoizing the result.

## TODOs
- Consider memoizing the theme determination logic to avoid unnecessary recalculations on re-renders.
- The service worker registration could be moved to a separate utility function for better separation of concerns.
