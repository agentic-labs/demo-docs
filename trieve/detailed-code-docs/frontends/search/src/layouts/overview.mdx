## High-level description
The `frontends/search/src/layouts` directory houses layout components for the search functionality of the application. These layouts provide a consistent structure and shared functionality across different search-related pages.

## What does it do?
This directory contains components that define the overall layout of search-related pages. They handle common UI elements like the navigation bar, theme management (light or dark mode), and toast notifications. They also manage service worker registration for offline capabilities. Essentially, these layouts provide a skeleton structure that other search-specific components can slot into.

## Key Files
- **`HomeLayout.tsx`:** This component defines the layout for the main search page. It includes the main search interface (`HomeSearch` component) and the toast notification system (`ShowToast` component).
- **`SearchLayout.tsx`:** This component provides a more general layout structure for search-related pages. It includes a navbar, the toast notification system, and wraps its children (the content specific to each page) in a consistent layout.

Both layouts handle theme management and service worker registration. They determine the theme based on user preferences (local storage) or system settings and apply it by toggling the "dark" class on the document's root element. They also attempt to register a service worker to enable offline functionality, logging the registration status to the console.
