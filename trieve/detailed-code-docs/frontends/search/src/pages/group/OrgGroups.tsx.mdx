## High-level description
This code defines the `OrgGroups` component, which renders a page displaying a list of groups within an organization. It includes functionality for deleting groups and confirming the deletion through a modal dialog.

## Code Structure
The `OrgGroups` component uses the `SearchLayout` as its main structure and includes a `GroupUserPageView` for displaying the list of groups. It also implements a `FullScreenModal` for confirming group deletion.

5. Provides buttons for confirming or canceling the group deletion.
