## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `ViewGroup` that displays and manages a group of chunks (presumably text or data segments) in a search interface. It allows users to view, edit, and interact with group information, search within the group, and fetch related chunks or groups.

## Code Structure
The main `ViewGroup` component uses several state variables and effects to manage the group's data, search results, and user interactions. It renders a complex UI with conditional elements based on the current state and user actions.

## References
This component references several other components and utilities, including `SearchLayout`, `GroupPage`, `FullScreenModal`, `ConfirmModal`, `PaginationController`, `SearchForm`, `ChunkMetadataDisplay`, `ScoreChunk`, and various icons and utility functions.
