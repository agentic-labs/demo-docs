### NotFound
#### Description
The `NotFound` component is a functional React component that renders a 404 error page. It uses the `SearchLayout` component as a wrapper and includes a centered message with a link to return to the home page, as well as a `Footer` component.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props.

#### Outputs
Returns a JSX element representing the 404 error page.

#### Internal Logic
1. Wraps the content in a `SearchLayout` component.
2. Uses flexbox to center the error message and link vertically.
3. Displays a "404 Not Found" message and a link to return to the home page.
4. Includes the `Footer` component at the bottom of the page.

## References
- `SearchLayout`: Imported from "../layouts/SearchLayout"
- `Footer`: Imported from "../components/Footer"

## Dependencies
This component relies on the following external components:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| SearchLayout | Provides the overall layout structure for the page |
| Footer | Renders the footer section of the page |

## Code Structure
The `NotFound` component is structured as follows:
1. `SearchLayout` wrapper
2. Flex container for vertical centering
3. Error message and home link
4. `Footer` component

## Additional Notes
1. The component uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling, such as `flex`, `flex-1`, `text-3xl`, etc.
2. The link to the home page uses the `text-turquoise-500` class for styling, indicating a specific color scheme.
3. The `SearchLayout` component (from the related code snippets) handles the overall page structure, including the navbar and theme management.
4. The `Footer` component (from the related code snippets) includes social media links and a theme mode controller.

This 404 page provides a simple and clean user interface for handling not found errors, maintaining consistency with the rest of the application's design and layout.
