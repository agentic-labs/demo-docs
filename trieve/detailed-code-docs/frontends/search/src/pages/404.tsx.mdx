### NotFound
#### Description
The `NotFound` component is a functional React component that renders a 404 error page. It uses the `SearchLayout` component as a wrapper and includes a centered message with a link to return to the home page, as well as a `Footer` component.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props.

#### Outputs
Returns a JSX element representing the 404 error page.

#### Internal Logic
1. Wraps the content in a `SearchLayout` component.
2. Uses flexbox to center the content vertically and horizontally.
3. Displays a "404 Not Found" message and a link to return to the home page.
4. Includes the `Footer` component at the bottom of the page.

## References
- `SearchLayout`: Imported from "../layouts/SearchLayout"
- `Footer`: Imported from "../components/Footer"

## Dependencies
This component relies on the following external components:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| SearchLayout | Provides the overall layout structure for the page |
| Footer | Renders the footer section of the page |

## Additional Notes
1. The component uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling, as evident from the class names used in the JSX.
2. The "Head Back Home" link uses the `text-turquoise-500` class, suggesting a specific color scheme for links.
3. The layout uses flex containers to distribute space and center content vertically.

Based on the related code snippets provided:

4. The `SearchLayout` component handles theme switching (light/dark mode) and includes a `Navbar` component, which will be present in the 404 page.
5. The `Footer` component includes social media links, contact information, and a theme mode controller, which will be displayed at the bottom of the 404 page.

This 404 page design ensures consistency with the rest of the application by using the same layout and footer components, providing a seamless user experience even when encountering an error page.
