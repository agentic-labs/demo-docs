## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `EditChunk` that renders a page for editing a document chunk. It uses the SearchLayout and includes a form for editing chunk details, along with a footer component.

## Code Structure
The `EditChunk` component is the main symbol in this file. It imports and uses several other components such as `Footer`, `SearchLayout`, `EditChunkPageForm`, and `A` (for routing).

## Symbols

### `EditChunk`
#### Description
A functional component that renders the edit chunk page layout.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| props | any | Component props (not explicitly typed) |

#### Outputs
Returns a JSX element representing the edit chunk page.

#### Internal Logic
1. Renders a `SearchLayout` component as the main container.
2. Inside the layout, it displays:
   - A link to the home page with the Trieve logo and page title.
   - An `EditChunkPageForm` component for editing the chunk details.
   - A `Footer` component at the bottom of the page.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @solidjs/router | For routing functionality (A component) |
| ../../../components/Footer | Footer component |
| ../../../layouts/SearchLayout | Layout component for search pages |
| ../../../components/EditChunkPageForm | Form component for editing chunk details |

## Notes
1. The component uses the `eslint-disable-next-line` comment to suppress linting warnings for unsafe assignments and member access when passing the `chunkId` prop to `EditChunkPageForm`.
2. The component uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling.
3. The `chunkId` is extracted from the route parameters (`props.params.id`).
4. A default `resultChunk` object is passed to `EditChunkPageForm` with initial metadata and status values.

This component serves as a wrapper for the actual editing functionality, which is implemented in the `EditChunkPageForm` component. It provides the overall page structure and layout for the chunk editing interface.
