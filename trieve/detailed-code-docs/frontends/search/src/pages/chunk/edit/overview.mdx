## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `EditChunk` that renders a page for editing a document chunk. It uses the SearchLayout component and includes a form for editing chunk details, along with a footer.

## Code Structure
The `EditChunk` component is the main symbol in this file. It uses several imported components and a routing component to structure the page layout and functionality.

## Symbols

### `EditChunk`
#### Description
A functional component that renders the edit chunk page.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| props | any | Component props (not explicitly typed) |

#### Outputs
Returns a JSX element representing the edit chunk page.

#### Internal Logic
1. Renders a `SearchLayout` component as the main container.
2. Inside the layout, it displays:
   - A link to the home page with the Trieve logo and page title.
   - An `EditChunkPageForm` component for editing the chunk details.
   - A `Footer` component at the bottom of the page.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @solidjs/router | For routing functionality (A component) |
| ../../../components/Footer | Footer component |
| ../../../layouts/SearchLayout | Layout component for search pages |
| ../../../components/EditChunkPageForm | Form component for editing chunk details |

## Notes
1. The component uses the `eslint-disable-next-line` comment to suppress linting warnings for specific lines.
2. The `chunkId` prop passed to `EditChunkPageForm` is accessed from `props.params.id`, suggesting that this component is likely used in a route with a dynamic segment for the chunk ID.
3. The component uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling.
4. The logo image is loaded from an external CDN.

This component serves as a wrapper for the chunk editing functionality, providing the overall page structure and layout while delegating the actual editing form to the `EditChunkPageForm` component.
