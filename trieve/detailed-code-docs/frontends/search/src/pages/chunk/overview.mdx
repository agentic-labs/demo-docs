## High-level description
This directory provides the user interface for viewing and editing individual document chunks within the search interface. It handles routing, layout, and data display for chunk-related actions.

## What does it do?
This code defines how users interact with individual pieces of documents (chunks) within the search results. It allows users to view the content of a specific chunk and provides an interface for editing chunk details. 

The `ViewChunk` component displays a single chunk's content within a consistent search layout, including a footer. It fetches and displays the chunk's content based on the provided chunk ID.

The `EditChunk` component provides a form for editing the details of a specific chunk. It also uses the search layout and includes a footer for consistency.

## Entry points
- `ViewChunk.tsx`: This component is responsible for displaying the content of a single chunk.
- `edit/EditChunk.tsx`: This component provides the interface for editing a chunk's details.

The code is conceptually organized around these two main actions: viewing and editing. Each entry point corresponds to one of these actions and utilizes shared components like `SearchLayout` and `Footer` for a consistent user experience. Data flow is primarily handled by child components like `SingleChunkPage` and `EditChunkPageForm`.
