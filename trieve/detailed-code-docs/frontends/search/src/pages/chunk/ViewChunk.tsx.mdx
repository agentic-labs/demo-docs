## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `ViewChunk` that renders a single chunk page within a search layout. It displays a chunk's content along with related components such as a footer and a single chunk page component.

## Code Structure
The `ViewChunk` component is composed of imported components (`Footer`, `SearchLayout`, and `SingleChunkPage`) and renders them in a specific structure.

### ViewChunk
#### Description
`ViewChunk` is a functional component that renders the view for a single chunk. It uses the `SearchLayout` component to provide a consistent layout structure and includes the `SingleChunkPage` and `Footer` components.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| props | any | The component props, expected to contain a `params.id` for the chunk ID |

#### Internal Logic
1. Renders the `SearchLayout` component as the main wrapper.
2. Inside the layout, it renders the `SingleChunkPage` component, passing the `chunkId` from props and a `defaultResultChunk` object.
3. Adds a flex spacer div.
4. Renders the `Footer` component at the bottom.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Footer | Renders the footer of the page |
| SearchLayout | Provides the overall layout structure for search-related pages |
| SingleChunkPage | Renders the content of a single chunk |

## Notes
1. The component uses TypeScript, but the `props` parameter is typed as `any`, which is generally discouraged. It would be better to define a specific interface for the expected props.
2. There are ESLint disable comments for TypeScript-related rules, suggesting that there might be type-checking issues that should be addressed for better type safety.
3. The `defaultResultChunk` object is hardcoded with minimal information. It might be better to define this elsewhere or pass it as a prop if it's used across multiple components.
4. The component doesn't handle any state or side effects directly, delegating most of the functionality to the `SingleChunkPage` component.

This component serves as a wrapper to display a single chunk within the application's search interface, providing a consistent layout and including necessary UI elements like the footer.
