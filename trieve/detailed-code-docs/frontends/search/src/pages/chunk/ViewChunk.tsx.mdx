### ViewChunk
#### Description
`ViewChunk` is a functional component that renders a single chunk page within a search layout.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| props | any | Component props (not explicitly typed) |

#### Internal Logic
1. Renders a `SearchLayout` component as the main wrapper.
2. Inside the layout, it renders a `SingleChunkPage` component, passing the `chunkId` from props and a default result chunk object.
3. Adds a flex spacer div.
4. Renders the `Footer` component at the bottom.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Footer | Renders the footer of the page |
| SearchLayout | Provides the overall layout structure for the search page |
| SingleChunkPage | Displays the content of a single chunk |

## Notes
1. The component uses ESLint disable comments to suppress warnings about explicit `any` types and unsafe assignments. This suggests that type checking could be improved.
2. The `chunkId` prop is passed to `SingleChunkPage` using the `props.params.id`, indicating that this component might be used in a routing context where the chunk ID is part of the URL parameters.
3. A default result chunk object is provided with null metadata and a status of 0.
4. The component uses a flex layout to ensure the footer stays at the bottom of the page.

This component serves as a wrapper for displaying a single chunk's details within the application's search interface, integrating various components to create a cohesive user experience.
