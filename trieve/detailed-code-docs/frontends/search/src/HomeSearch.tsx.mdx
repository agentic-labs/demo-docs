## High-level description
The `HomeSearch` component is the main search interface for the Trieve application. It provides a search form, displays search results, and includes navigation elements. The component utilizes various hooks and sub-components to manage the search functionality and user interface.

## Code Structure
The `HomeSearch` component is composed of several sub-components and uses the `useSearch` hook to manage search state. The main elements are:
- `Navbar`: Provides navigation and dataset selection
- `SearchForm`: Handles user input for search queries
- `ResultsPage`: Displays search results
- `Footer`: Shows footer information
