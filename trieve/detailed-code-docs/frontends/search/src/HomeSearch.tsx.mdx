## High-level description
The `HomeSearch` component is the main search interface for the Trieve application. It provides a search form, displays search results, and includes navigation elements. The component integrates various sub-components and hooks to create a comprehensive search experience.

## Code Structure
The `HomeSearch` component uses the `useSearch` hook to manage search state and functionality. It renders a `Navbar`, `SearchForm`, `ResultsPage`, and `Footer`. The component also manages a state for rating queries.

4. Renders a `ResultsPage` component, passing the search state and rate query-related props.
5. Renders a `Footer` at the bottom of the page.
