## High-level description
This code is the main entry point for a React-like application built with Solid.js. It sets up routing, Sentry error tracking, and renders the main application structure. The code defines the routing structure for different pages and wraps the entire application in a context provider for dataset and user information.

## Code Structure
The main symbols in this code are the route components and the `DatasetAndUserContextWrapper`. The routes are defined using the `Route` component from `@solidjs/router`, and they are all wrapped within the `DatasetAndUserContextWrapper`, which provides context for the entire application.

## Symbols

### `NotFoundRedirect`
#### Description
A component that redirects to the home page when a route is not found.

#### Internal Logic
It sets the `window.location.href` to "/" and returns an empty fragment.

### `render` function call
#### Description
This is the main rendering function that sets up the application structure.

#### Internal Logic
1. It creates a `Router` component as the root of the application.
2. Inside the `Router`, it defines various routes using the `Route` component.
3. Each route is associated with a specific component (e.g., `Home`, `Upload`, `CreateChunk`, etc.).
4. The entire router is wrapped in the `DatasetAndUserContextWrapper`.
5. The rendered content is attached to the DOM element with id "root".

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| solid-js/web | Provides the `render` function for rendering the application |
| @solidjs/router | Provides routing functionality |
| @sentry/browser | Error tracking and monitoring |
| solid-js | Core library for building user interfaces |

## Error Handling
The code implements Sentry for error tracking and monitoring. Sentry is initialized only in non-development environments (`!DEV`). It sets up browser tracing and replay integrations, with specific configuration for trace propagation and session replay sampling.

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| VITE_SENTRY_SEARCH_DSN | string | N/A | Sentry DSN for error reporting |

## API/Interface Reference
The code defines the following routes:
| Endpoint | Component | Description |
|:---------|:----------|:------------|
| / | Home | Home page |
| /upload | Upload | File upload page |
| /create | CreateChunk | Create new chunk page |
| /chunk/edit/:id | EditChunk | Edit chunk page |
| /chunk/:id | ViewChunk | View chunk page |
| /group | OrgGroups | Organization groups page |
| /group/:id | ViewGroup | View specific group page |
| /:not_found | NotFoundRedirect | Catch-all route for not found pages |

Note: All routes are wrapped in the `DatasetAndUserContextWrapper` component, which provides context for dataset and user information throughout the application.
