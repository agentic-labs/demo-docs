## High-level description
The `useSearch` hook manages the search state and parameters for the application. It synchronizes the search state with URL parameters, allowing users to share and bookmark specific search configurations. The hook also provides a debounced version of the state to optimize search requests.

## Code Structure
The `useSearch` hook uses the `createStore` function from Solid.js to manage the search state. It defines two stores: `state` and `debounced`. The `state` store holds the current search options, while the `debounced` store holds a debounced version of the state, updated after a short delay. The hook also uses the `useSearchParams` hook from Solid Router to synchronize the search state with URL parameters.

## References
- `@solidjs/router`: Used for managing URL parameters and navigation.
- `solid-js`: Used for reactive state management and effects.

### `useSearch`
#### Description
This hook manages the search state and parameters for the application. It synchronizes the search state with URL parameters, allowing users to share and bookmark specific search configurations. The hook also provides a debounced version of the state to optimize search requests.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| debounced | `SearchOptions` | A debounced version of the search state, updated after a short delay. |
| state | `SearchOptions` | The current search options. |
| setSearch | `(key: keyof SearchOptions, value: any) =&gt; void` | A function to update the search state. |

#### Internal Logic
1. **Initialization:**
    - The hook initializes the search state with default values from `initalState` and values from URL parameters using `fromParamsToState`.
    - It creates two stores: `state` and `debounced`, both initialized with the same values.
2. **Synchronization with URL Parameters:**
    - A `createEffect` is used to synchronize the `state` store with URL parameters.
    - Whenever the `version` property of the `state` store changes, the `setSearchParams` function is called to update the URL parameters with the current search options using `fromStateToParams`.
    - A timeout is set to update the `debounced` store with the current state after a 200ms delay. This debouncing prevents excessive search requests when the user is typing.
3. **State Update:**
    - The `setSearch` function is proxied to increment the `version` property of the `state` store after each update. This triggers the synchronization with URL parameters and the debouncing mechanism.

## Side Effects
- Modifies URL parameters to reflect the current search state.

## Dependencies
- `@solidjs/router`
- `solid-js`
- `solid-js/store`

## Configuration
The `initalState` object defines the default search options.

## Error Handling
No specific error handling mechanisms are implemented in this hook.

## Logging
No logging mechanisms are implemented in this hook.

## API/Interface Reference
The `useSearch` hook exposes the following API:

- `debounced`: A debounced version of the search state.
- `state`: The current search options.
- `setSearch`: A function to update the search state.

## TODOs
