title: "useSearch.ts"
---

## High-level description
This code defines a custom React hook called `useSearch` that manages the state and logic for a search functionality. It handles various search options, filters, and pagination, and provides methods to update and synchronize the search state with URL parameters.

## Code Structure
The main symbols in this code are:
- `useSearch`: The main hook function that initializes and manages the search state.
- `SearchOptions`: An interface defining the structure of search options.
- `SortByField` and `SortBySearchType`: Interfaces for sorting options.
- `HighlightStrategy`: A type for highlight strategies.
- Various utility functions like `isSortByField`, `isSortBySearchType`, and `isHighlightStrategy`.

These symbols are interconnected, with `useSearch` using the interfaces and utility functions to manage the search state.

## Symbols

### `useSearch`
#### Description
A custom hook that manages the search state, including debounced updates and synchronization with URL parameters.

#### Outputs
Returns an object containing:
- `debounced`: The debounced search state.
- `state`: The current search state.
- `setSearch`: A function to update the search state.

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes the search state using `createStore`.
2. Creates a debounced version of the state.
3. Sets up an effect to update URL parameters when the state changes.
4. Provides a proxied `setSearch` function that increments a version number.

### `SearchOptions`
#### Description
An interface defining the structure of search options, including query parameters, filters, and display settings.

### `SortByField` and `SortBySearchType`
#### Description
Interfaces defining sorting options for search results.

### `HighlightStrategy`
#### Description
A type defining possible highlight strategies for search results.

### Utility Functions
#### Description
Several utility functions (`isSortByField`, `isSortBySearchType`, `isHighlightStrategy`) to check the type of certain objects or values.

## Dependencies
- `@solidjs/router`: For handling URL parameters.
- `solid-js`: For reactive state management.

## Configuration
The code defines an `initalState` object with default values for all search options.

## Error Handling
The code doesn't implement explicit error handling. Errors would be handled by the calling component.

## Performance Considerations
The use of debounced state updates helps to reduce unnecessary re-renders and API calls.

This hook provides a comprehensive way to manage search state, including URL synchronization, which is useful for creating shareable search URLs and maintaining state across page reloads.
