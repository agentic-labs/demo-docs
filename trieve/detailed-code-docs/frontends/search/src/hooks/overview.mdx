## High-level description
This directory contains custom React hooks that manage various aspects of the search functionality in the application. The hooks handle dataset server configuration retrieval and search state management, including synchronization with URL parameters.

## What does it do?
The hooks in this directory provide essential functionality for the search feature of the application:

1. `useDatasetServerConfig`: This hook fetches the server configuration for a specific dataset. It allows the application to dynamically adjust its behavior based on the dataset-specific settings retrieved from the server.

2. `useSearch`: This hook manages the search state and parameters. It keeps the search options in sync with URL parameters, enabling users to share and bookmark specific search configurations. It also provides a debounced version of the search state to optimize search requests and prevent excessive API calls.

These hooks work together to create a robust and user-friendly search experience, allowing for dynamic configuration based on the dataset and maintaining a shareable search state through URL parameters.

## Key Files

1. `useDatasetServerConfig.ts`:
   - Fetches the server configuration for the current dataset.
   - Uses the SolidJS framework and makes an API call to retrieve the configuration.
   - Utilizes the `DatasetAndUserContext` to access the current dataset information.

2. `useSearch.ts`:
   - Manages the search state and parameters for the application.
   - Synchronizes the search state with URL parameters for shareability.
   - Provides a debounced version of the state to optimize search requests.
   - Uses SolidJS for reactive state management and Solid Router for URL parameter handling.

## Dependencies
The hooks in this directory rely on the following external libraries and frameworks:

1. SolidJS (solid-js): Used for reactive state management, creating resources, and handling side effects.
   - Version: Not specified in the provided information.
   - Chosen for its efficient reactivity system and lightweight nature.

2. Solid Router (@solidjs/router): Used for managing URL parameters and navigation.
   - Version: Not specified in the provided information.
   - Chosen to integrate seamlessly with SolidJS for routing functionality.

## Configuration
The hooks use the following configuration options:

1. `useDatasetServerConfig`:
   - Environment variable: `VITE_API_HOST`
     - Type: string
     - Description: The base URL for the API

2. `useSearch`:
   - `initalState` object: Defines the default search options.

Both hooks rely on context providers and environment variables for configuration, allowing for flexible setup across different environments.

## Code Examples

1. Using `useDatasetServerConfig`:

```typescript
import { useDatasetServerConfig } from './hooks/useDatasetServerConfig';

function DatasetConfigComponent() {
  const [data] = useDatasetServerConfig();
  
  return (
    &lt;div&gt;
      {data() ? (
        &lt;pre&gt;{JSON.stringify(data(), null, 2)}&lt;/pre&gt;
      ) : (
        &lt;p&gt;Loading dataset configuration...&lt;/p&gt;
      )}
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
}
```

2. Using `useSearch`:

```typescript
import { useSearch } from './hooks/useSearch';

function SearchComponent() {
  const { state, setSearch, debounced } = useSearch();
  
  return (
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;input
        type="text"
        value={state.query}
        onInput={(e) =&gt; setSearch('query', e.target.value)}
      /&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Debounced query: {debounced.query}&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
}
```

These examples demonstrate how to integrate the custom hooks into components, leveraging their functionality to fetch dataset configurations and manage search state with URL synchronization and debouncing.

The hooks in this directory provide essential building blocks for creating a powerful and user-friendly search interface, with considerations for performance optimization and shareability. They abstract away complex logic related to API calls, state management, and URL parameter handling, allowing developers to focus on building the user interface and search experience.
