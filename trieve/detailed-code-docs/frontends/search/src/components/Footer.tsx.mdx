### `Footer`
#### Description
The `Footer` function is a React component that renders the footer section of the web application. It includes social media icons with links, an email address, and a theme mode controller.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props.

#### Outputs
Returns a JSX element representing the footer.

#### Internal Logic
1. The component renders a container `div` with flex layout and centered items.
2. It creates a row of social media icons (Matrix, Discord, Twitter, GitHub) with links to respective platforms.
3. Below the social media icons, it displays an email address and the `ThemeModeController` component.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| solid-icons/bi | Provides icons for Discord, GitHub, and Twitter |
| solid-icons/si | Provides the Matrix icon |
| ./ThemeModeController | Imports the ThemeModeController component |

## Side Effects
The component doesn't have any side effects. It's a pure presentational component that renders static content and includes interactive elements (links and ThemeModeController).

## Performance Considerations
The Footer component is relatively lightweight and doesn't involve any complex computations. However, it does import several icons from the `solid-icons` library, which might have a small impact on the initial load time of the application.

## References
- The `ThemeModeController` component is imported and used within this component, suggesting that theme-related functionality is handled separately.
- The component uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling, indicating that the project likely uses Tailwind for its CSS framework.

This Footer component appears to be widely used across various pages of the application, as evidenced by its inclusion in multiple related files such as `OrgGroups.tsx`, `ViewChunk.tsx`, `HomeSearch.tsx`, `Upload.tsx`, `CreateChunk.tsx`, `EditChunk.tsx`, `ViewGroup.tsx`, and `404.tsx`. This consistent usage ensures a uniform footer appearance throughout the application.
