### `Footer`
#### Description
The `Footer` function component renders a footer section with social media links, contact information, and a theme mode controller.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props.

#### Outputs
Returns a JSX element representing the footer.

#### Internal Logic
1. The component renders a container div with flex layout and centered items.
2. It displays a row of social media icons (Matrix, Discord, Twitter, GitHub) as clickable links.
3. Below the social media links, it shows an email address and the `ThemeModeController` component.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| solid-icons/bi | Provides icons for Discord, GitHub, and Twitter |
| solid-icons/si | Provides the Matrix icon |
| ./ThemeModeController | Imports the ThemeModeController component for theme switching |

## References
- The `ThemeModeController` component is imported and used within the Footer.
- The Footer component is used in various pages of the application, such as `HomeSearch`, `OrgGroups`, `ViewChunk`, `Upload`, `CreateChunk`, `EditChunk`, `ViewGroup`, and `NotFound`.

## Side Effects
This component doesn't have any side effects. It's a pure presentational component.

## Performance Considerations
The Footer component is relatively lightweight, consisting mainly of static content and icons. The only potential performance consideration might be related to the `ThemeModeController` component, depending on its implementation.
