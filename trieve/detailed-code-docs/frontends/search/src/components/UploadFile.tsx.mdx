## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `UploadFile` that allows users to upload files to a server. It provides a user interface for selecting files or folders, inputting metadata, and configuring various upload options. The component handles file selection, drag-and-drop functionality, and the actual file upload process.

## Code Structure
The `UploadFile` component is the main export of this file. It uses various hooks and state variables to manage the upload process and user interface. The component renders a form with input fields for metadata, file selection, and advanced options. It also includes functions for handling file uploads and drag-and-drop functionality.

## Symbols

### UploadFile
#### Description
The main component that renders the file upload interface and handles the upload process.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't take any props.

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes state variables for file selection, metadata, and upload options.
2. Defines handlers for file selection, drag-and-drop, and form submission.
3. Renders a form with various input fields and options for file upload.
4. Handles the file upload process, including converting files to base64 and sending them to the server.

#### Side Effects
- Makes API calls to upload files to the server.
- Updates local storage with the current dataset information.

### handleDrop
#### Description
Handles the drag-and-drop functionality for file and folder uploads.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| e | DragEvent | The drag event object |

#### Internal Logic
1. Prevents default behavior and stops event propagation.
2. Extracts items from the drag event.
3. Traverses the file system entries to collect all files.
4. Updates the component's state with the collected files.

### traverseFileTree
#### Description
Recursively traverses a file system entry to collect all files.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| item | FileSystemEntry | The file system entry to traverse |
| path | string | The current path (optional) |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise&lt;File[]&gt; | Promise | A promise that resolves to an array of File objects |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the item is a file or directory.
2. If it's a file, resolves with the file object.
3. If it's a directory, recursively reads its entries and collects all files.

### uploadFiles
#### Description
Handles the file upload process when the user submits the form.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| e | Event | The form submission event |

#### Internal Logic
1. Prevents default form submission behavior.
2. Validates the current dataset and selected files.
3. Converts files to base64 format.
4. Prepares the request body with file data and metadata.
5. Sends POST requests to the server for each file.
6. Handles the server response and updates the component state accordingly.

## Dependencies
The component uses various imports from SolidJS, shared UI components, and icon libraries. It also relies on environment variables for API host and dashboard URL configuration.

## Configuration
The component uses environment variables for configuration:
| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| VITE_API_HOST | string | The API host URL |
| VITE_DASHBOARD_URL | string | The dashboard URL |

## Error Handling
The component implements basic error handling by setting error messages in the component state and displaying them to the user. It also handles API response errors and updates the UI accordingly.

## Performance Considerations
The component handles file uploads asynchronously, which helps prevent blocking the main thread during large file uploads. However, for very large files or a high number of files, there might be performance implications that should be considered.
