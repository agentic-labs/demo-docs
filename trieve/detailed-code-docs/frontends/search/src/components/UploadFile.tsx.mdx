## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `UploadFile` that provides a user interface for uploading files to a dataset. It allows users to select files or folders, add metadata, and configure various upload options. The component handles file selection, drag-and-drop functionality, and submits the files to an API endpoint for processing.

## Code Structure
The main `UploadFile` component uses several state variables to manage the upload process. It includes functions for handling file selection, drag-and-drop, and form submission. The component renders a form with various input fields and a file upload area, along with advanced options that can be toggled.

## Symbols

### UploadFile
#### Description
The main component that renders the file upload interface and handles the upload process.

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes state variables for file selection, form inputs, and upload status.
2. Defines handlers for file selection, drag-and-drop, and form submission.
3. Renders a form with input fields for various upload options.
4. Provides a file/folder selection area with drag-and-drop support.
5. Handles file upload by converting files to base64 and sending them to the API.

#### Side Effects
- Modifies state variables based on user interactions.
- Sends HTTP requests to upload files when the form is submitted.

### handleDrop
#### Description
Handles the drop event when files are dragged and dropped onto the upload area.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| e | DragEvent | The drag event object |

#### Internal Logic
1. Prevents default behavior and stops event propagation.
2. Retrieves dropped items and processes them as files or directories.
3. Traverses directory structures if folders are dropped.
4. Updates the `files` state with the dropped files.

### traverseFileTree
#### Description
Recursively traverses a file system entry (file or directory) to collect all files.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| item | FileSystemEntry | The file system entry to traverse |
| path | string | The current path (optional) |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise&lt;File[]&gt; | Promise | A promise that resolves to an array of File objects |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the item is a file or directory.
2. If it's a file, resolves with the file object.
3. If it's a directory, reads its contents and recursively traverses subdirectories.
4. Collects all files from the directory structure.

### uploadFiles
#### Description
Handles the file upload process when the form is submitted.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| e | Event | The form submission event |

#### Internal Logic
1. Prevents default form submission behavior.
2. Validates that files have been selected.
3. Prepares the request body with form data and file information.
4. Converts each file to base64 format.
5. Sends POST requests to the API for each file.
6. Handles the API response and updates the component state accordingly.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| solid-js | Provides reactive primitives and components |
| solid-icons | Provides icon components |
| shared/ui | Provides shared UI components (JsonInput, Tooltip) |

## Error Handling
The component sets error messages in the `errorText` state variable when validation fails or API requests encounter errors. These error messages are displayed to the user.

## API/Interface Reference
| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| /file | POST | RequestBody (JSON) | - | Uploads a file to the specified dataset |

The RequestBody includes file data, metadata, and various processing options.
