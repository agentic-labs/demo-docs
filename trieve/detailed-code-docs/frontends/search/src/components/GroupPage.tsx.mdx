## High-level description
The `GroupPage` component is a complex React component that displays and manages a group of chunks (text segments) in a search interface. It provides functionality for viewing, searching, filtering, and interacting with chunks within a specific group, as well as managing group metadata and recommendations.

## Code Structure
The main `GroupPage` component contains several sub-components and hooks that work together to provide the full functionality:
- It uses the `DatasetAndUserContext` for user and dataset information.
- The `useSearch` hook manages search state and operations.
- Various state variables manage different aspects of the page (e.g., loading states, pagination, group info).
- Several effect hooks handle data fetching and updates based on changes in props or state.
- The component renders a complex UI with search forms, chunk displays, pagination, and various modals for additional interactions.

- SolidJS for reactivity and component structure
- `@solidjs/router` for routing
- Custom hooks like `useSearch` for search functionality
- Various utility functions and type definitions from local files

## Error Handling
The component uses toast notifications to display errors to the user, particularly for API request failures.
