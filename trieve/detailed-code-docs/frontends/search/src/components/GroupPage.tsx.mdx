## High-level description
The `GroupPage` component is a complex React component that displays and manages a group of chunks (text segments) in a search interface. It provides functionality for viewing, searching, filtering, and interacting with chunks within a specific group, as well as managing group metadata and recommendations.

## Code Structure
The main `GroupPage` component contains several sub-components and hooks that work together to provide the full functionality:
- It uses the `DatasetAndUserContext` for user and dataset information.
- The `useSearch` hook manages search state and parameters.
- Various signals (using SolidJS's `createSignal`) manage component state.
- Several effect hooks (`createEffect`) handle side effects like fetching data and updating the UI.
- The component renders a complex UI with search forms, chunk displays, pagination, and modals for various actions.
