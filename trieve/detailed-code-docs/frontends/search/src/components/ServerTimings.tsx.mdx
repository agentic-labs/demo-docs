## High-level description
The `ServerTimings` component is a React component that displays server timing information in a visual format. It takes an array of server timing data and renders it as a series of colored bars, representing the duration of each timing metric.

## Code Structure
The main `ServerTimings` component uses several helper components and functions to render the timing information. It utilizes Solid.js for reactivity and state management.

## Symbols

### ServerTimings
#### Description
The main component that renders the server timing information.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| timings | ServerTiming[] | An array of server timing objects |

#### Internal Logic
1. Calculates the total time of all timings.
2. Creates memoized values for labels and banner components.
3. Uses ResizeObserver to track the width of the container and timing box.
4. Renders the total time, labels, and timing bars.

### createMemo(() =&gt; {...})
#### Description
Creates memoized values for total time, labels, and banner components.

### onMount(() =&gt; {...})
#### Description
Sets up ResizeObservers to track the width of the container and timing box.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| solid-js | For reactive programming and component creation |

## Performance Considerations
The component uses `createMemo` to optimize the calculation of derived values, reducing unnecessary recomputation.

## Side Effects
The component sets up ResizeObservers in the `onMount` function, which are cleaned up when the component is unmounted.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code.
