title: "ChunkMetadataDisplay.tsx"
---

## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `ChunkMetadataDisplay` that renders detailed information about a chunk of data, including its metadata, content, and various user interactions like bookmarking, editing, and deleting. It also provides functionality for expanding/collapsing the chunk content and viewing full metadata.

## Code Structure
The main `ChunkMetadataDisplay` component uses several other components and utilities:
- It imports icons from `solid-icons` library for various UI elements.
- It uses `BookmarkPopover` for managing bookmarks.
- It utilizes `FullScreenModal` for displaying full metadata.
- It employs `DatasetAndUserContext` for accessing dataset and user information.
- It uses `createToast` for showing notifications.
- It imports `Tooltip` from a shared UI library.

The component is structured with several conditional renders using Solid.js's `Show` component, and it uses signals for managing state.

### ChunkMetadataDisplay
#### Description
This is the main component that displays chunk metadata and content. It handles various user interactions and displays different pieces of information based on the chunk's properties.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| totalGroupPages | number | Total number of group pages |
| signedInUserId | string (optional) | ID of the signed-in user |
| viewingUserId | string (optional) | ID of the user viewing the chunk |
| chunk | ChunkMetadata | The chunk data to display |
| score | number (optional) | Score of the chunk |
| chunkGroups | ChunkGroupDTO[] | Array of chunk groups |
| bookmarks | ChunkBookmarksDTO[] | Array of bookmarks |
| setShowConfirmModal | Setter&lt;boolean&gt; | Function to set the confirm modal visibility |
| fetchChunkGroups | () =&gt; void | Function to fetch chunk groups |
| setChunkGroups | Setter&lt;ChunkGroupDTO[]&gt; | Function to set chunk groups |
| setOnDelete | Setter&lt;() =&gt; void&gt; | Function to set the delete action |
| showExpand | boolean (optional) | Whether to show the expand option |

#### Internal Logic
1. It manages several internal states using signals (e.g., expanded, deleting, showMetadata).
2. It handles chunk deletion through the `onDelete` function.
3. It renders various chunk properties (ID, link, tag set, etc.) conditionally.
4. It provides an expand/collapse functionality for long chunk content.
5. It offers a full metadata view through a modal.

## Side Effects
- The component makes API calls to delete chunks when the delete action is triggered.
- It interacts with local storage to manage referral tokens.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| solid-js | For creating reactive components and managing state |
| solid-icons | For various icons used in the UI |
| sanitize-html | For sanitizing HTML content |
| shared/ui | For the Tooltip component |

## Error Handling
The component uses `createToast` to show error messages when chunk deletion fails.

## API/Interface Reference
The component doesn't explicitly define an API but it interacts with an external API for chunk deletion. The API endpoint is constructed using:
```javascript
`${apiHost}/chunk/${curChunkId}`
```
Where `apiHost` is expected to be defined in the environment variables.

This component provides a comprehensive view of a chunk's metadata and content, with various interactive elements for user actions. It's designed to be flexible, handling different states and user permissions, and integrates with a larger system for managing chunks of data.
