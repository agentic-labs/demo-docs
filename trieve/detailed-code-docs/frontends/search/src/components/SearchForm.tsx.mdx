## High-level description
This code defines a `SearchForm` component in React, which provides a user interface for performing searches with various options and filters. It includes functionality for entering search queries, selecting search types, applying filters, and configuring search parameters.

## Code Structure
The main `SearchForm` component contains several sub-components and hooks for managing state and user interactions. It uses SolidJS for reactivity and rendering, and integrates with a search store for managing search-related state.

## Symbols

### SearchForm
#### Description
The main component that renders the search form interface.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| search | SearchStore | The search store containing search state and methods |
| groupID | string (optional) | ID of the group being searched |
| openRateQueryModal | Setter&lt;boolean&gt; | Function to open the rate query modal |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes state for various search options and filters
2. Handles user interactions for search query input, search type selection, and filter application
3. Manages the visibility and state of different search options and modals
4. Updates the search store based on user inputs and selections

### createEffect
#### Description
Several `createEffect` hooks are used to handle side effects and synchronize state between different parts of the component.

### Filters and Search Types
The component manages various filters and search types, including:
- Must, Must Not, and Should filters
- Search types (e.g., Hybrid, FullText, Semantic)
- Sort types and Rerank types

### Performance Considerations
- The component uses debouncing for search query updates to reduce unnecessary API calls
- It implements lazy loading for some UI elements to improve initial render performance

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| solid-js | Core library for reactive UI components |
| solid-headless | UI component library |
| solid-icons | Icon components |
| shared/ui | Custom UI components |

## Configuration
The component uses environment variables for configuration:
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| VITE_BM25_ACTIVE | string | - | Enables BM25 search option if set to a truthy value |

## TODOs
- There are several ESLint disable comments that should be addressed to improve code quality and type safety.

This component is a complex and feature-rich search form that provides users with a wide range of options for configuring and performing searches. It integrates tightly with a search store and uses SolidJS for efficient rendering and state management.
