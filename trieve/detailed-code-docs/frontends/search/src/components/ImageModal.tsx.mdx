## High-level description
The `ImageModal` component is a React component that displays a modal with a series of images. It fetches signed URLs for the images based on the provided range and prefix, and renders them in a scrollable container within a full-screen modal.

## Code Structure
The main `ImageModal` component uses several hooks and components from Solid.js, including `createEffect`, `createSignal`, and `useContext`. It also imports a `FullScreenModal` component and a `DatasetAndUserContext` for dataset information.

### ImageModal
#### Description
This is the main component that renders a modal containing a series of images.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| showImageModal | Accessor&lt;boolean&gt; | Controls the visibility of the modal |
| setShowImageModal | Setter&lt;boolean&gt; | Function to update the modal's visibility |
| imgInformation | Accessor&lt;{ imgRangeStart: number; imgRangeEnd: number; imgRangePrefix: string; } \| null&gt; | Information about the image range and prefix |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the API host from environment variables.
2. Uses the `DatasetAndUserContext` to get the current dataset.
3. Creates a signal to store signed image URLs.
4. Uses `createEffect` to fetch signed URLs for each image in the range when the component mounts or `imgInformation` changes.
5. Renders a `FullScreenModal` component containing a scrollable div with images.
6. Uses a `For` component to iterate over the image range and render each image.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| solid-js | Provides reactive primitives and components |
| ./Atoms/FullScreenModal | Renders a full-screen modal |
| ./Contexts/DatasetAndUserContext | Provides dataset and user information |

## Error Handling
The component doesn't implement explicit error handling for failed image loads or API requests. It might benefit from adding error states and fallback UI for these scenarios.

## Performance Considerations
The component fetches signed URLs for all images in the range at once, which could be inefficient for large ranges. Consider implementing lazy loading or pagination for better performance with large image sets.

## TODOs
- Consider adding error handling for failed image loads and API requests.
- Implement lazy loading or pagination for better performance with large image sets.
- Add alt text to images for accessibility.
- Consider adding loading states while fetching signed URLs.
