## High-level description
The `ImageModal` component is a React component that displays a modal with a series of images. It fetches signed URLs for the images based on the provided range and prefix, and renders them in a scrollable container within a full-screen modal.

## Code Structure
The main `ImageModal` component uses several hooks and components from Solid.js, including `createEffect`, `createSignal`, and `useContext`. It also imports a `FullScreenModal` component and a `DatasetAndUserContext` for dataset information.

### ImageModal
#### Description
This is the main component that renders a modal containing a series of images.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| showImageModal | Accessor&lt;boolean&gt; | Controls the visibility of the modal |
| setShowImageModal | Setter&lt;boolean&gt; | Function to update the modal visibility |
| imgInformation | Accessor&lt;{ imgRangeStart: number; imgRangeEnd: number; imgRangePrefix: string; } \| null&gt; | Information about the image range and prefix |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the API host from environment variables.
2. Uses the `DatasetAndUserContext` to get the current dataset.
3. Creates a signal to store signed image URLs.
4. Uses `createEffect` to fetch signed URLs for each image in the range when the component mounts or `imgInformation` changes.
5. Renders a `FullScreenModal` component containing the images.
6. Uses a `For` component to iterate over the image range and render each image.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| solid-js | Provides reactive primitives and components |
| ./Atoms/FullScreenModal | Renders a full-screen modal |
| ./Contexts/DatasetAndUserContext | Provides dataset and user information |

## API/Interface Reference
| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| /file/get_signed_url/{fileName}.png | GET | Headers: X-API-version, TR-Dataset | { signed_url: string } | Retrieves a signed URL for the specified image file |

## Error Handling
The component doesn't implement explicit error handling for the API requests. Errors during fetch operations will be silently ignored.

## Performance Considerations
The component fetches signed URLs for all images in the range simultaneously, which could lead to performance issues for large ranges. Consider implementing pagination or lazy loading for better performance with large image sets.
