## High-level description
The `AfMessage` component is a React component that renders a message in a chat-like interface. It displays messages from different roles (user, assistant, or system) with appropriate styling and content, including the ability to show streaming completions and associated chunks of information.

## Code Structure
The main component `AfMessage` uses several Solid.js primitives like `createSignal`, `createEffect`, and `Show`. It also imports and uses other components like `ScoreChunk` for displaying associated chunks of information.

### AfMessage
#### Description
This is the main component that renders a message in the chat interface.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| role | "user" \| "assistant" \| "system" | The role of the message sender |
| content | string | The content of the message |
| streamingCompletion | Accessor&lt;boolean&gt; | Indicates if the message is being streamed |
| chunks | Accessor&lt;ScoreChunkDTO[]&gt; | Associated chunks of information |
| order | number | The order of the message in the conversation |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates signals for selected chunk IDs and content.
2. Uses `createEffect` to update content when props change.
3. Renders different UI elements based on the role and content.
4. Displays user or assistant icon based on the role.
5. Sanitizes and renders the message content.
6. Shows a loading spinner when content is empty.
7. Renders associated chunks for assistant messages.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| solid-js | For reactive primitives and components |
| solid-icons | For icons used in the UI |
| sanitize-html | For sanitizing HTML content |
| ScoreChunk | Component for rendering associated chunks |

## Performance Considerations
The component uses `createEffect` to efficiently update the content when props change, which helps in optimizing re-renders. The use of `Show` components also helps in conditional rendering, potentially improving performance by not rendering unnecessary elements.

## Error Handling
The component doesn't implement explicit error handling. It relies on the parent component to provide valid props.

## Accessibility
The component uses semantic HTML elements like `div` for structure, which provides a basic level of accessibility. However, it could be improved by adding ARIA attributes for better screen reader support.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code, but potential improvements could include:
1. Adding more robust error handling.
2. Enhancing accessibility with ARIA attributes.
3. Implementing lazy loading for chunks to improve performance with large datasets.
