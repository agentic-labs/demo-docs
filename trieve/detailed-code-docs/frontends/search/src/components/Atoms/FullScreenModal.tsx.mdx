Here's a detailed documentation for the `FullScreenModal` component:

## High-level description
The `FullScreenModal` component is a reusable UI element that displays a full-screen modal dialog. It's designed to present content in an overlay that covers the entire screen, providing a focused view for important information or interactions.

## Code Structure
The component is built using SolidJS and utilizes the `solid-headless` library for dialog functionality. It takes props to control its visibility and content, and uses Portal for rendering outside the normal component tree.

The FullScreenModal is used in various parts of the application to display important information or interactions in a full-screen overlay. It's particularly useful for presenting detailed content, forms, or confirmations that require the user's full attention.

For example, it's used in the ResultsPage component to display a chat interface, in the EditChunkPageForm for login prompts, and in the GroupPage for various modal dialogs like rating queries and confirming deletions.
