## High-level description
This code defines a `FullScreenModal` component in React using Solid.js. It creates a modal dialog that can be opened and closed, and displays its children content in a centered, full-screen overlay.

## Code Structure
The `FullScreenModal` component uses the `Dialog`, `DialogOverlay`, `DialogPanel`, `Transition`, and `TransitionChild` components from the `solid-headless` library to create the modal structure. It also uses the `Portal` component from Solid.js to render the modal outside the current component hierarchy.

## Symbols

### FullScreenModalProps
#### Description
An interface that defines the props for the `FullScreenModal` component.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| children | JSX.Element | The content to be displayed inside the modal |
| isOpen | Accessor&lt;boolean&gt; | A function that returns whether the modal should be open |
| setIsOpen | Setter&lt;boolean&gt; \| ((open: boolean) =&gt; void) | A function to set the open state of the modal |

### FullScreenModal
#### Description
A functional component that renders a full-screen modal dialog.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses the `Transition` component to handle the appearance and disappearance of the modal.
2. Renders a `Dialog` component with overlay and content.
3. Uses `TransitionChild` for animating the modal content.
4. Closes the modal when the `onClose` event is triggered.

## Side Effects
The component doesn't have any side effects beyond updating the UI based on the `isOpen` prop.

## Dependencies
- solid-js
- solid-headless

This component provides a reusable full-screen modal that can be easily integrated into other parts of the application, allowing for consistent modal behavior across the app.
