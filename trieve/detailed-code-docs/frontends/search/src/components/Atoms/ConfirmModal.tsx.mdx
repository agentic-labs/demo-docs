### ConfirmModal
#### Description
A modal component that displays a confirmation message with "Delete" and "Cancel" options.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| showConfirmModal | Accessor&lt;boolean&gt; | Controls the visibility of the modal |
| setShowConfirmModal | Setter&lt;boolean&gt; | Function to update the modal's visibility |
| onConfirm | Accessor&lt;() =&gt; void&gt; | Function to be executed on confirmation |
| message | string | The message to be displayed in the modal |

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses `Show` component to conditionally render the modal based on `showConfirmModal`.
2. Renders a `FullScreenModal` component with the following content:
   - An error icon (`BiRegularXCircle`)
   - The provided message or a default message
   - "Delete" and "Cancel" buttons
3. The "Delete" button triggers the `onConfirm` function and closes the modal.
4. The "Cancel" button simply closes the modal.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| solid-js | For using SolidJS components and utilities |
| solid-icons/bi | For the BiRegularXCircle icon |
| solid-icons/fi | For the FiTrash icon |
| ./FullScreenModal | For the modal structure |

The `ConfirmModal` component is a flexible and reusable confirmation dialog that can be easily integrated into various parts of the application where user confirmation is required before performing critical actions.
