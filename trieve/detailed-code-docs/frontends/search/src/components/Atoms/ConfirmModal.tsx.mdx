### ConfirmModal
#### Description
A modal component that displays a confirmation message and provides options for the user to confirm or cancel an action.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| showConfirmModal | Accessor&lt;boolean&gt; | Controls the visibility of the modal |
| setShowConfirmModal | Setter&lt;boolean&gt; | Function to update the visibility state |
| onConfirm | Accessor&lt;() =&gt; void&gt; | Function to be executed when the user confirms the action |
| message | string | The message to be displayed in the modal |

#### Internal Logic
1. The component uses a `Show` component to conditionally render the modal based on `showConfirmModal()`.
2. It utilizes the `FullScreenModal` component to create the modal structure.
3. The modal content includes an icon, the confirmation message, and two buttons (Delete and Cancel).
4. When the Delete button is clicked, it closes the modal and executes the `onConfirm` function.
5. The Cancel button simply closes the modal without any additional action.

## Dependencies

| solid-icons/bi | For the BiRegularXCircle icon |

The `ConfirmModal` component is designed to be a flexible and reusable confirmation dialog that can be easily integrated into various parts of the application where user confirmation is required before proceeding with potentially destructive or important actions.
