## Code Structure
The `Navbar` component is composed of several parts:
1. Desktop view with logo, organization/dataset selectors, and navigation links
2. Mobile view with a hamburger menu for smaller screens
3. Mobile menu that appears when the hamburger icon is clicked

### Navbar
#### Description
The main functional component that renders the navigation bar.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't take any props.

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the dashboard URL from environment variables
2. Uses the `DatasetAndUserContext` to access user and dataset information
3. Creates a memoized value for the current dataset ID
4. Manages the state of the mobile menu (open/closed)
5. Renders different elements based on screen size and user authentication status

#### Side Effects
- The component updates the URL with the current dataset ID when navigating to different pages
