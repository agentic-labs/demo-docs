## High-level description
The `Navbar` component is a responsive navigation bar for a web application. It provides links to various sections of the application and adapts its layout based on screen size. The component also includes functionality for selecting organizations and datasets.

## Code Structure
The `Navbar` component is composed of several parts:
1. Imports and context usage
2. Memoized values for current dataset and organization
3. Mobile menu toggle state
4. URL parameter construction for the dashboard link
5. JSX structure for desktop and mobile layouts

## Symbols

### Navbar
#### Description
The main functional component that renders the navigation bar.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't take any props.

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the dashboard URL from environment variables.
2. Uses the `DatasetAndUserContext` to access user and dataset information.
3. Creates memoized values for the current dataset and organization IDs.
4. Manages the state of the mobile menu (open/closed).
5. Constructs URL parameters for the dashboard link.
6. Renders the navigation bar with conditional elements based on screen size and user authentication status.

#### Performance Considerations
The component uses `createMemo` for values that depend on context, which helps optimize performance by preventing unnecessary recalculations.

### createMemo(() =&gt; {...})
#### Description
Creates memoized values for the current dataset ID and organization ID.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| currentDatasetId | string | The ID of the current dataset |
| currentOrganizationId | string | The ID of the current organization |

### createMemo(() =&gt; {...}) for orgDatasetParams
#### Description
Constructs the URL parameters for the dashboard link based on the current dataset and organization.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| orgDatasetParams | string | URL parameters for the dashboard link |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| solid-js | For reactive programming and component creation |
| DatasetAndUserContext | Provides user and dataset information |
| OrganizationSelectBox | Component for selecting organizations |
| DatasetSelectBox | Component for selecting datasets |

## Side Effects
The component doesn't have any direct side effects, but it does rely on the `DatasetAndUserContext` which may have its own side effects.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this component. It relies on the error handling of its child components and the context it uses.

This Navbar component is a crucial part of the application's user interface, providing navigation and context-aware links. It's designed to be responsive and adapts its layout based on the screen size, ensuring a good user experience across different devices.
