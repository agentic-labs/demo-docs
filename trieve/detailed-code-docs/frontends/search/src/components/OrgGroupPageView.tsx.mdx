## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `GroupUserPageView` that displays a list of chunk groups for a dataset. It allows users to view, delete, and download groups, and provides pagination functionality. The component fetches group data from an API and manages the state of groups, pagination, and loading.

## Code Structure
The main component `GroupUserPageView` uses several hooks and context providers to manage state and fetch data. It renders a table of chunk groups with options to delete and download, and includes pagination controls.

## Symbols

### `GroupUserPageView`
#### Description
This is the main component that renders the list of chunk groups and handles user interactions.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| setOnDelete | Setter&lt;(delete_chunks: boolean) =&gt; void&gt; | Function to set the delete handler |
| setShowConfirmModal | Setter&lt;boolean&gt; | Function to show/hide the confirmation modal |

#### Internal Logic
1. Fetches group data from the API based on the current dataset and page number.
2. Manages state for groups, pagination, loading, and deleting.
3. Handles group deletion with confirmation.
4. Renders a table of groups with options to delete and download.
5. Implements pagination controls.

### `deleteGroup`
#### Description
This function handles the deletion of a chunk group.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| group | ChunkGroupDTO | The group to be deleted |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up the delete handler function.
2. Sends a DELETE request to the API to remove the group.
3. Updates the local state to reflect the deletion.

### `handleDownloadFile`
#### Description
This function initiates the download of a file associated with a group.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |

#### Internal Logic
Calls the `downloadFile` utility function with the file ID and dataset ID.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| solid-js | For reactive state management and component rendering |
| solid-icons | For icon components |
| ../utils/apiTypes | For type definitions |
| ../hooks/useDatasetServerConfig | Custom hook for fetching dataset configuration |
| ../utils/downloadFile | Utility function for downloading files |

## Error Handling
The component includes basic error handling for API requests, setting the loading state to false on error. However, it doesn't explicitly handle or display error messages to the user.

## Performance Considerations
The component uses pagination to limit the number of groups fetched and displayed at once, which helps with performance for large datasets.
