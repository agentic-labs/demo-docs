title: "ShowToasts.tsx"
---

## High-level description
This code defines a `ShowToast` component and related functionality for displaying toast notifications in a React application. It provides a mechanism to create and show toast messages with different types (success or error) and automatically remove them after a specified duration.

## Code Structure
The code consists of two main parts:
1. The `createToast` function, which dispatches a custom event to show a toast.
2. The `ShowToast` component, which listens for these events and renders the toasts.

## Symbols

### `ToastDetail`
#### Description
An interface defining the structure of a toast notification.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| type | string | The type of toast (e.g., "success" or "error") |
| message | string | The message to be displayed in the toast |

### `ToastEvent`
#### Description
An interface extending the standard Event interface to include the ToastDetail.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| detail | ToastDetail | The details of the toast notification |

### `createToast`
#### Description
A function that creates and dispatches a custom event to show a toast notification.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| type | string | The type of toast (e.g., "success" or "error") |
| message | string | The message to be displayed in the toast |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a new CustomEvent named "show-toast" with the provided type and message.
2. Dispatches the event on the window object.

### `ShowToast`
#### Description
A functional component that renders and manages toast notifications.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses `createSignal` to manage the state of toast details.
2. Sets up an effect to listen for "show-toast" events and update the state accordingly.
3. Renders a list of toast notifications using the `For` component from Solid.js.
4. Each toast is displayed with an icon, message, and close button.
5. Automatically removes toasts after 1500ms using a setTimeout.

## Side Effects
- The component adds and removes an event listener on the window object.
- It uses setTimeout to automatically remove toasts, which is cleared on cleanup.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| solid-js | For creating reactive components and managing state |
| solid-icons/bs | For the success icon (BsCheck2Circle) |
| solid-icons/bi | For the error icon (BiRegularErrorCircle) |
| solid-icons/vs | For the close icon (VsClose) |

This component provides a reusable and customizable way to display toast notifications in a Solid.js application, with automatic cleanup and easy integration through the `createToast` function.
