## High-level description
The `SingleChunkPage` component is a complex React component that displays detailed information about a single chunk of data. It fetches and renders chunk metadata, allows for editing and deleting the chunk, and provides functionality for bookmarking, chatting, and recommending related chunks.

## Code Structure
The component is structured with several interconnected parts:
1. State management using `createSignal` and `createEffect` hooks
2. API calls for fetching chunk data, bookmarks, and recommendations
3. Rendering of chunk metadata and content
4. User interaction handlers for expanding/collapsing content, editing, deleting, and chatting
5. Sub-components for modals and popups

## Symbols

### SingleChunkPage
#### Description
The main component that orchestrates the display and interaction with a single chunk of data.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| chunkId | string \| undefined | The ID of the chunk to display |
| defaultResultChunk | SingleChunkDTO | Default chunk data to display while loading |

#### Internal Logic
1. Fetches chunk data, bookmarks, and chunk groups on mount
2. Manages state for chunk metadata, error messages, and UI interactions
3. Handles chunk deletion and recommendation fetching
4. Renders chunk content, metadata, and interaction buttons
5. Manages chat functionality and related chunks display

### fetchChunk
#### Description
Fetches the chunk data from the API.

#### Internal Logic
1. Makes an API call to retrieve chunk data
2. Updates component state with fetched data or error messages
3. Handles polling for recently uploaded chunks

### fetchRecommendations
#### Description
Fetches recommended chunks based on the current chunk.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ids | string[] | IDs of chunks to base recommendations on |
| prev_recommendations | ScoreChunkDTO[] | Previously fetched recommendations |

#### Internal Logic
1. Makes an API call to get recommended chunks
2. Updates component state with new recommendations
3. Deduplicates recommendations against previously fetched ones

## Side Effects
- The component makes several API calls that modify the application state.
- It interacts with local storage to persist chat messages.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| solid-js | For reactive programming and component structure |
| @solidjs/router | For routing functionality |
| solid-icons | For icon components |

## Error Handling
The component handles various error scenarios, including:
- Unauthorized access (401 errors)
- Not found errors (404 errors)
- Recently uploaded chunks that are still processing

## API/Interface Reference
| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:------------|
| /chunk/${chunkId} | GET | Retrieves chunk data |
| /dataset/groups/${datasetId}/1 | GET | Fetches chunk groups |
| /chunk_group/chunks | POST | Retrieves bookmarks for chunks |
| /chunk/recommend | POST | Fetches recommended chunks |

Note: The component uses a `VITE_API_HOST` environment variable to determine the API host.
