## High-level description
This code implements a theme mode controller component for a web application. It allows users to switch between light, dark, and system-based themes, and persists the user's preference in local storage. The component provides a visually appealing dropdown menu for theme selection.

## Code Structure
The code consists of utility functions for theme management and a main `ThemeModeController` component. The utility functions handle setting, getting, and clearing the theme mode, while the component renders the UI and manages the theme state.

## Symbols

### `setThemeMode`
#### Description
Sets the theme mode for the application and updates the document's class list and local storage.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mode | "light" \| "dark" | The desired theme mode |

#### Internal Logic
1. Determines the opposite mode
2. Removes the opposite mode class from the document
3. Sets the theme in local storage
4. Adds the new mode class to the document

### `getThemeMode`
#### Description
Retrieves the current theme mode from local storage.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mode | "light" \| "dark" \| "system" | The current theme mode |

### `clearThemeMode`
#### Description
Clears the theme mode from local storage and sets the theme based on the system preference.

#### Internal Logic
1. Removes the theme from local storage
2. Checks the system preference for dark mode
3. Updates the document's class list accordingly

### `ThemeModeController`
#### Description
A component that renders a theme mode selector with a popover menu.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a signal for the current theme
2. Uses an effect to set the initial theme
3. Renders a button with a sun/moon icon based on the current theme
4. Renders a popover menu with options for light, dark, and system themes
5. Updates the theme when an option is selected

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| solid-headless | Provides UI components like Menu, Popover, and Transition |
| solid-js | Provides reactive primitives like createSignal and createEffect |
| solid-icons | Provides icons for the theme selector |

## Side Effects
- Modifies the `classList` of the `documentElement`
- Interacts with `localStorage` to persist theme preferences

## Performance Considerations
The component uses transitions for smooth animations when showing/hiding the popover menu, which may impact performance on low-end devices.

## Error Handling
The code doesn't implement explicit error handling, relying on default behavior for potential issues like localStorage access failures.
