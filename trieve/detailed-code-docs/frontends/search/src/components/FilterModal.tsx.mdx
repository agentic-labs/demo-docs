title: "FilterModal.tsx"
---

## High-level description
This code defines a FilterModal component for a search interface in a React application. It allows users to create, modify, and apply complex filters to their search queries, including field filters, geo-radius filters, range filters, and date range filters.

## Code Structure
The code defines several interfaces and types for filters and their properties. It then implements the FilterItem component, which renders the UI for a single filter. The component uses Solid.js for reactivity and state management.

## Symbols

### `FilterItem`
#### Description
A component that renders a single filter item in the filter modal.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| props | FilterItemProps | Contains the initial filter and a callback for filter changes |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes state for the current filter and temporary filter properties.
2. Uses `createEffect` to update the filter when its properties change.
3. Renders input fields and selectors for different filter types (field, geo_radius, range, date_range, match).
4. Updates the parent component when the filter changes.

### `filterIsHasIdFilter`, `filterAsHasIdFilter`, `filterIsFieldFilter`, `filterAsFieldFilter`
#### Description
Utility functions to check and cast filter types.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| filter | Filter | The filter to check or cast |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | boolean or Filter subtype | The result of the type check or cast |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| solid-js | For reactive programming and component creation |

## Configuration
The component uses several configuration options defined in the `FilterItemProps` interface, such as initial filter values and callback functions.

## Error Handling
The code doesn't implement explicit error handling. It relies on TypeScript for type safety.

## Performance Considerations
The component uses Solid.js's fine-grained reactivity system, which should provide good performance for updating individual filter properties without unnecessary re-renders.
