title: "FilterModal.tsx"
---

## High-level description
This code defines a FilterModal component for a search interface. It allows users to create, modify, and apply complex filters for search queries, including options for different filter types, search modes, and sorting methods.

## Code Structure
The main component is `FilterItem`, which handles individual filter creation and modification. It interacts with the parent component through props and signals to manage the overall filter state. The component uses various SolidJS primitives like `createSignal`, `createEffect`, and `For` to manage reactivity and render the UI.

## Symbols

### FilterItem
#### Description
A component that renders and manages an individual filter item in the filter modal.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| initialFilter | Filter | The initial filter configuration |
| onFilterChange | (filter: Filter) =&gt; void | Callback function to handle filter changes |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes state for the current filter, filter mode, and filter field.
2. Sets up effects to update the current filter based on user interactions.
3. Renders input fields and selectors for filter configuration.
4. Handles different filter modes (geo_radius, range, date_range, match) with conditional rendering.

### Filter (Interface)
Defines the structure of a filter object, including field, geo_radius, match, range, and date_range properties.

### Filters (Interface)
Defines the structure of the overall filters object, including must, must_not, and should arrays of Filter objects.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| solid-js | Core library for reactive UI components |
| solid-icons | Icon components used in the UI |
| solid-headless | UI components like Popover and Menu |

## Configuration
The component uses various configuration options defined in the `SearchOptions` interface (not shown in this file). These options control search behavior, highlighting, and result presentation.

## Error Handling
The code doesn't implement explicit error handling. It relies on TypeScript for type safety and assumes valid inputs.

## Performance Considerations
The component uses SolidJS's fine-grained reactivity system, which should provide good performance for most use cases. However, with complex filters and many options, there might be a need for optimization in larger applications.

This component is part of a larger search interface and works in conjunction with other components to provide a comprehensive search experience. It's designed to be flexible and handle various filter types and search modes.
