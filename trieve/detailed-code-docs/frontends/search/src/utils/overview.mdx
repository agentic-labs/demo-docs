## High-level description
This directory contains utility functions and type definitions for the Trieve search application's frontend. It includes a comprehensive set of TypeScript interfaces and types for various data structures used throughout the application, as well as utility functions for file downloading and type checking.

## What does it do?
The utils directory serves several key purposes:

1. Type Definitions: It provides a robust set of TypeScript interfaces and types for data structures used in the application, such as chunk metadata, user information, organizations, datasets, and search results. These type definitions help ensure type safety and improve code quality across the project.

2. Type Guards: The directory includes several type guard functions that allow for runtime type checking of objects, helping to prevent errors and improve reliability.

3. File Download Utility: It contains a function for downloading files associated with specific datasets, leveraging the browser's built-in download capabilities.

4. API Request Structures: The directory defines structures for API requests and responses, facilitating communication with the backend.

5. Data Transfer Objects (DTOs): Various DTOs are defined to standardize data transfer between different parts of the application and between the frontend and backend.

## Key Files

### apiTypes.ts
This file is the core of the utils directory, containing a comprehensive set of TypeScript interfaces, types, and utility functions. Key features include:

- Definitions for core data structures like `ChunkMetadata`, `UserDTO`, and `OrganizationDTO`.
- Type guards for runtime type checking (e.g., `isChunkMetadata`, `isUserDTO`).
- Structures for API requests and responses.
- Definitions for search-related types like `ChunkFilter` and `FullTextBoost`.

### downloadFile.ts
This file contains the `downloadFile` utility function, which handles the process of downloading files associated with specific datasets. It interacts with the API to fetch file information and triggers the browser's download functionality.

## Dependencies
The utils directory primarily relies on TypeScript's built-in types and features. It doesn't explicitly import external libraries, but it does use environment variables (e.g., `VITE_API_HOST`) for configuration.

## Configuration
The `downloadFile` function uses the `VITE_API_HOST` environment variable to determine the API host URL. This allows for flexible configuration across different environments.

In summary, the utils directory provides a foundation for type safety, data structure consistency, and common utilities in the Trieve search application's frontend. It plays a crucial role in maintaining code quality and facilitating interaction with the backend API.
