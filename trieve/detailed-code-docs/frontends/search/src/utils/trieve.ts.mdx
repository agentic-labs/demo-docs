## High-level description
This code defines and exports a `trieve` instance, which is an instance of the `Trieve` class from the "trieve-fetch-client" library. It initializes the `Trieve` instance with a base URL obtained from the environment variable `VITE_API_HOST`.

## Symbols

### `trieve`
#### Description
`trieve` is an instance of the `Trieve` class, which is likely used for making API requests to a Trieve server. It is initialized with a configuration object containing the base URL for the API.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| baseUrl | string | The base URL for the Trieve API, obtained from the environment variable `VITE_API_HOST` |

#### Internal Logic
The `trieve` instance is created using the `new` keyword, passing an object with the `baseUrl` property to the `Trieve` constructor. The `baseUrl` is set using the `import.meta.env.VITE_API_HOST` environment variable, which is cast to a string.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| trieve-fetch-client | Provides the `Trieve` class for interacting with the Trieve API |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| VITE_API_HOST | string | N/A | Environment variable containing the base URL for the Trieve API |

## References
This code likely references other parts of the application that use the `trieve` instance to make API calls to the Trieve server. The specific usage of `trieve` is not shown in this file but would be found in other parts of the codebase.

Based on the related code snippets provided:

1. The `Trieve` class (from `clients/fetch-client/src/index.ts`) is a more complex implementation that handles various HTTP methods, request parameters, and response parsing. It suggests that the `trieve` instance created in this file can be used to make API calls with different methods and parameters.

2. The Helm chart (`helm/templates/ingest-deployment.yaml`) shows that there are various environment variables set for a Trieve deployment, including `BASE_SERVER_URL`. This suggests that the `VITE_API_HOST` used in this file might correspond to the `BASE_SERVER_URL` in the server-side configuration.

Note: The actual usage and integration of the `trieve` instance in the broader application context are not visible in the provided code snippet. Its full utilization would be apparent in other parts of the frontend codebase where API calls to the Trieve server are made.
