title: "tsconfig.json"
---

## High-level description
This file is a TypeScript configuration file (`tsconfig.json`) for the shared frontend components of a project. It extends a base configuration and specifies compiler options and file inclusion patterns for the TypeScript compiler.

## Code Structure
The configuration is structured as a JSON object with three main properties: `extends`, `compilerOptions`, and `include`.

## Symbols

### extends
#### Description
This property specifies that the current configuration extends another TypeScript configuration file.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| extends | string | Path to the base configuration file |

The value `"config/tsconfig"` indicates that this configuration extends a base configuration located at `config/tsconfig.json` (or `config/tsconfig.js`).

### compilerOptions
#### Description
This property specifies compiler options that override or add to the options from the extended configuration.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| noUnusedLocals | boolean | Disables error reporting for unused local variables |

In this case, `"noUnusedLocals": false` is set, which turns off the TypeScript compiler's check for unused local variables.

### include
#### Description
This property specifies an array of file or directory patterns to be included in the compilation.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| include | string[] | Array of file or directory patterns to include |

The specified patterns are:
- `"src"`: Includes all TypeScript files in the `src` directory and its subdirectories.
- `"ui"`: Includes all TypeScript files in the `ui` directory and its subdirectories.
- `"types"`: Includes all TypeScript files in the `types` directory and its subdirectories.
- `"types.ts"`: Specifically includes the `types.ts` file in the root of the project.
- `"utils"`: Includes all TypeScript files in the `utils` directory and its subdirectories.

## Dependencies
This configuration file depends on the base configuration file specified in the `extends` property:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| config/tsconfig | Base TypeScript configuration that this file extends |

## Configuration
The main configuration options defined in this file are:
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| noUnusedLocals | boolean | false | Disables error reporting for unused local variables |

Note that other configuration options may be inherited from the extended base configuration.
