title: "tsconfig.json"
---

## High-level description
This file is a TypeScript configuration file (`tsconfig.json`) for the shared frontend components of a project. It extends a base configuration and specifies compiler options and file inclusion patterns for the TypeScript compiler.

## Code Structure
The configuration is structured as a JSON object with three main properties: `extends`, `compilerOptions`, and `include`.

## Symbols

### `extends`
#### Description
This property specifies the base configuration file that this configuration extends from.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| extends | string | Path to the base configuration file |

The value "config/tsconfig" indicates that this configuration extends from a file named `tsconfig` located in the `config` directory.

### `compilerOptions`
#### Description
This property specifies compiler options that override or add to the options from the extended configuration.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| noUnusedLocals | boolean | Disables the error reporting for unused local variables |

In this case, `noUnusedLocals` is set to `false`, which means the TypeScript compiler will not report errors for unused local variables.

### `include`
#### Description
This property specifies an array of file or directory patterns to be included in the compilation.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| include | string[] | Array of file or directory patterns to include |

The included patterns are:
- "src": Likely the main source directory
- "ui": Possibly containing UI-related TypeScript files
- "types": A directory for type definitions
- "types.ts": A specific file for type definitions
- "utils": Likely a directory for utility functions

## Dependencies
This configuration file depends on the base configuration file located at `config/tsconfig`.

## Configuration
The main configuration option set in this file is:
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| noUnusedLocals | boolean | false | Disables error reporting for unused local variables |

Note: Other configuration options may be inherited from the base configuration file, but they are not visible in this specific file.
