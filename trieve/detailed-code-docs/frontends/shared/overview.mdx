## High-level description
The `frontends/shared` directory contains shared components, utilities, and configurations used across different frontend applications in the project. It includes UI components, TypeScript types, utility functions, and configuration files for linting and TypeScript compilation.

## What does it do?
This shared directory serves as a central repository for common frontend code and resources, promoting code reuse and consistency across different parts of the application. It provides:

1. Reusable UI components for common interface elements like date pickers, modals, and tables.
2. Shared TypeScript types and interfaces for data structures used throughout the application.
3. Utility functions for class name merging and other common operations.
4. Configuration files for ESLint and TypeScript to ensure consistent code style and type checking.
5. A package.json file defining shared dependencies and export configurations.

By centralizing these shared resources, the project can maintain consistency in UI design, data structures, and development practices across different frontend applications.

## Key Files
1. `ui/`: A directory containing reusable UI components such as DateRangePicker, FullscreenModal, and Table.
2. `types.ts`: Defines TypeScript interfaces and types for various data structures used in the application, including user roles, organizations, and datasets.
3. `utils/index.ts`: Contains utility functions, particularly the `cn` function for merging CSS class names efficiently.
4. `.eslintrc.json`: Configures ESLint rules for the shared frontend code, ensuring consistent code style and quality.
5. `tsconfig.json`: Specifies TypeScript compiler options for the shared code.
6. `package.json`: Defines the shared package's dependencies, scripts, and export configurations.

## Dependencies
The shared frontend code relies on several key dependencies:

1. Solid.js: The core library for building reactive UI components.
2. TypeScript: For static typing and improved developer experience.
3. Tailwind CSS: Used for utility-first styling of components.
4. date-fns: A library for date manipulation and formatting.
5. clsx and tailwind-merge: Utilities for efficient class name management.
6. Various UI-related libraries like @rnwonder/solid-date-picker and terracotta for specific components.

## Configuration
The shared frontend code uses several configuration files:

1. `.eslintrc.json`: Configures ESLint with rules for TypeScript and Solid.js, extending recommended configurations and setting custom rules.
2. `tsconfig.json`: Extends a base TypeScript configuration and specifies compiler options such as disabling unused local variable checks.
3. `package.json`: Defines scripts, export configurations for different modules, and lists dependencies.

These configurations ensure consistent code quality, proper TypeScript compilation, and correct module exports for the shared frontend code.

The shared frontend code provides a foundation for building consistent and efficient user interfaces across different parts of the application, promoting code reuse and maintaining a cohesive development experience.
