## High-level description
The `frontends/shared` directory contains shared components, utilities, and configurations used across different frontend applications in the project. It includes TypeScript definitions, UI components, utility functions, and configuration files for linting and compilation.

## What does it do?
This shared frontend module provides:
1. Common TypeScript interfaces and types used throughout the frontend applications.
2. Reusable UI components for consistent user interface elements.
3. Utility functions for class name management and other common tasks.
4. Configuration files for TypeScript compilation and ESLint.
5. Package management and export configurations for the shared module.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this shared module is the `index.ts` file, which likely exports the key components, types, and utilities for use in other parts of the application. The `package.json` file defines how the module is exported and used by other parts of the project.

## Key Files
1. `types.ts`: Defines TypeScript interfaces and types for various data structures used across the application.
2. `ui/`: A directory containing reusable UI components.
3. `utils/`: A directory with utility functions, including the `cn` function for class name management.
4. `tsconfig.json`: Configuration for TypeScript compilation.
5. `.eslintrc.json`: ESLint configuration for maintaining code quality.
6. `package.json`: Defines the module's dependencies and export configuration.

## Dependencies
The shared module relies on several external libraries and frameworks:
- Solid.js: For building reactive UI components.
- Terracotta: Provides UI components and utilities.
- date-fns: For date manipulation and formatting.
- clsx and tailwind-merge: For efficient CSS class management.
- TypeScript: For static typing and improved developer experience.
- ESLint: For code linting and maintaining code quality.

## Configuration
1. TypeScript configuration in `tsconfig.json`:
   - Extends a base configuration from `config/tsconfig`.
   - Disables the `noUnusedLocals` option.
   - Includes specific directories and files in the compilation.

2. ESLint configuration in `.eslintrc.json`:
   - Extends various ESLint configurations for TypeScript and Solid.js.
   - Configures specific rules for unused variables and Prettier integration.

3. Package configuration in `package.json`:
   - Defines scripts, such as `genclient` for code generation.
   - Configures how different parts of the module are exported.
   - Lists production and development dependencies.

This shared frontend module serves as a foundation for building consistent and efficient user interfaces across different parts of the application. It provides a set of common tools, components, and type definitions that can be easily imported and used in other frontend modules, promoting code reuse and maintaining a consistent look and feel throughout the application.
