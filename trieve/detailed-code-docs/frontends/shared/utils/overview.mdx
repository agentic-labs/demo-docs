## High-level description
This code defines a utility function `cn` that combines the functionality of `clsx` and `tailwind-merge` to efficiently merge CSS class names, particularly useful when working with Tailwind CSS classes in a dynamic context.

## Symbols

### `cn`
#### Description
The `cn` function is a utility that combines multiple class names or conditional class expressions into a single string, optimized for use with Tailwind CSS.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ...args | ClassValue[] | A rest parameter that accepts any number of class values, which can be strings, objects, or arrays. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mergedClasses | string | A string containing the merged and optimized class names. |

#### Internal Logic
1. The function uses the spread operator to pass all arguments to `clsx`.
2. `clsx` processes these arguments and returns a string of class names.
3. The result from `clsx` is then passed to `twMerge`, which optimizes the class names for Tailwind CSS by removing conflicts and merging related classes.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| clsx | Utility for conditionally joining class names together |
| tailwind-merge | Utility for merging Tailwind CSS classes without style conflicts |

## References
The `cn` function is used in various components throughout the project, such as:
- `JSONMetadata` component in `frontends/shared/ui/JSONMetadata.tsx`
- `FilterBar` component in `frontends/analytics/src/components/FilterBar.tsx`
- `Table` component in `frontends/shared/ui/Table.tsx`
- `FullScreenModal` component in `frontends/shared/ui/FullscreenModal.tsx`

These components use `cn` to dynamically combine class names, allowing for flexible and efficient styling with Tailwind CSS.

## Performance Considerations
The `cn` function is designed to be efficient by leveraging `clsx` for fast class name concatenation and `tailwind-merge` for optimizing Tailwind CSS classes. This approach helps reduce the final CSS size by eliminating redundant or conflicting classes, which is particularly beneficial in larger applications with complex styling logic.
