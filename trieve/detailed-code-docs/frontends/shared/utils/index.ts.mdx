## High-level description
This code defines a utility function `cn` that combines the functionality of `clsx` and `tailwind-merge` to efficiently merge CSS class names, particularly useful when working with Tailwind CSS.

## Symbols

### `cn`
#### Description
The `cn` function is a utility that combines multiple class names or conditional class expressions into a single string, optimized for use with Tailwind CSS.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ...args | ClassValue[] | A rest parameter that accepts any number of class values or conditional class expressions |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mergedClasses | string | A string of merged and optimized class names |

#### Internal Logic
1. The function uses the spread operator to pass all arguments to `clsx`.
2. `clsx` processes these arguments, resolving any conditional expressions and combining them into a single string.
3. The result from `clsx` is then passed to `twMerge`, which optimizes the class names for Tailwind CSS by removing conflicts and merging related classes.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| clsx | Utility for conditionally joining class names together |
| tailwind-merge | Utility for merging Tailwind CSS classes without style conflicts |

## References
This utility function is used in various components throughout the project, such as:
- `FilterBar` in `frontends/analytics/src/components/FilterBar.tsx`
- `JSONMetadata` in `frontends/shared/ui/JSONMetadata.tsx`
- `FullScreenModal` in `frontends/shared/ui/FullscreenModal.tsx`
- `Table` components in `frontends/shared/ui/Table.tsx`
- `QueryStringDisplay` in `frontends/analytics/src/components/QueryStringDisplay.tsx`

These components use the `cn` function to efficiently combine and manage their CSS classes, especially when dealing with conditional styling or merging user-provided classes with component-specific ones.
