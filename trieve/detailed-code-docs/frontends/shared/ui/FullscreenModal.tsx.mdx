## High-level description
The `FullScreenModal` component is a reusable UI element that creates a full-screen modal dialog. It provides a customizable, animated modal with a title, content, and optional icon. This component is designed to be used across different parts of the application for displaying detailed information or additional content in a focused, overlay view.

## Code Structure
The main component `FullScreenModal` uses various sub-components from the `terracotta` library to create the modal structure. It utilizes SolidJS's `Portal` for rendering the modal outside the normal DOM hierarchy and `Transition` components for smooth animations.
