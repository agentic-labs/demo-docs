## High-level description
The `FullScreenModal` component is a reusable UI element that creates a full-screen modal dialog. It provides a customizable, animated modal with a title, optional icon, and content area, using the Solid.js framework and Terracotta UI library.

## Code Structure
The main component `FullScreenModal` uses various sub-components from the Terracotta library to create the modal structure. It leverages Solid.js's `Portal` for rendering outside the normal component tree and uses transition effects for smooth animations.

## Symbols

### FullScreenModal
#### Description
A functional component that renders a full-screen modal dialog with customizable content, title, and appearance.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| children | JSX.Element | The content to be displayed inside the modal |
| show | Accessor&lt;boolean&gt; | A function that returns a boolean indicating whether the modal should be shown |
| title | string (optional) | The title of the modal |
| setShow | (show: boolean) =&gt; void | A function to update the show state of the modal |
| icon | JSX.Element (optional) | An optional icon to display next to the title |
| class | string (optional) | Additional CSS classes to apply to the modal panel |

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses a `Portal` to render the modal outside the normal component tree.
2. Implements transition effects for smooth appearance and disappearance.
3. Creates a semi-transparent overlay behind the modal content.
4. Renders the modal content with optional title and icon.
5. Uses the `cn` utility function to combine CSS classes.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| solid-js | Core library for reactive UI components |
| terracotta | UI component library for dialog and transition effects |
| ../utils | Utility functions (specifically `cn` for class name merging) |

## Side Effects
The component creates a portal, which affects the DOM structure outside of the normal component tree.

## Performance Considerations
The use of `Portal` and transition effects may have minor performance implications, especially on lower-end devices. However, these are generally negligible for most use cases.

## API/Interface Reference
The `FullScreenModal` component is exported and can be imported and used in other parts of the application. It is also exported in the `frontends/shared/ui/index.ts` file, making it available as part of the shared UI components.

## Notes
- The component uses the `terracotta` library for dialog and transition components, which provides a consistent look and feel across the application.
- The `cn` utility function is used for merging CSS classes, allowing for easy customization of the modal's appearance.
- The component is designed to be flexible, allowing for various content types and optional elements like title and icon.
