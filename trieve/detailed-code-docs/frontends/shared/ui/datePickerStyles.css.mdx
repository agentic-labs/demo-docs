## References
This CSS file is referenced in the related `DateRangePicker.tsx` file:

1. It is imported at the top of the file:
   ```typescript
   import "./datePickerStyles.css";

2. The `daysActiveRangeBetweenWrapperClass` is used in the `DatePicker` component:

## Dependencies
This CSS file doesn't have any external dependencies. It's a standalone stylesheet that complements the styles provided by the `@rnwonder/solid-date-picker` library.

## Notes
1. The styles in this file are minimal and specific, suggesting that they are meant to override or complement the default styles of the date picker component.
2. The use of transparent background for selected days allows for more flexible styling options, potentially leveraging background styles from the underlying component.
3. The light gray background for the date range provides a visual indication of the selected range without being too intrusive.
4. The border around the date picker wrapper helps to visually separate it from surrounding content.

These custom styles work in conjunction with the default styles of the `@rnwonder/solid-date-picker` library to create a cohesive and customized appearance for the date picker component used in the application.
