## High-level description
This code defines a custom theme for the Ace editor, specifically tailored for JSON editing. It sets various styling properties for different elements of the editor, creating a dark-themed appearance with custom colors for syntax highlighting.

## Code Structure
The code is structured as a single function that defines the "trieve" theme for the Ace editor. It exports the theme properties and CSS styles, which are then applied to the editor.

## Symbols

### Anonymous Function
#### Description
This is the main function that defines the "trieve" theme for the Ace editor. It sets up the theme properties and CSS styles.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| acequire | function | A function to require Ace editor modules |
| exports | object | An object to which the theme properties are assigned |
| _module | object | Unused module parameter |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets `isDark` property to true, indicating a dark theme.
2. Sets `cssClass` to "ace-jsoneditor".
3. Defines a large string of CSS rules in `cssText` for various editor elements.
4. Imports the "dom" module from Ace editor.
5. Applies the CSS string to the editor using `dom.importCssString`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ace/lib/dom | Used to import the CSS string into the editor |

## References
This theme is referenced in the related file `JsonInput.tsx`, where it's used as the theme for the JSON editor:

```typescript
const jsonEditor = new JSONEditor(container, {
  theme: "ace/theme/trieve",
  // ...
});
```

## Side Effects
The code modifies the global `window` object by adding the theme definition to the Ace editor's themes.

## Performance Considerations
The CSS is defined as a single large string, which might have a slight impact on parsing time but allows for efficient application of styles.

## API/Interface Reference
| Property | Type | Description |
|:---------|:-----|:------------|
| isDark | boolean | Indicates that this is a dark theme |
| cssClass | string | The CSS class name for the theme |
| cssText | string | The CSS rules defining the theme's appearance |

This theme provides a dark appearance for the JSON editor with the following key style characteristics:
- Black background with light gray text
- Custom colors for syntax highlighting (e.g., tomato for keywords, gold for constants)
- Custom styles for selection, active line, and other editor elements

The theme is designed to provide good contrast and readability for JSON editing while maintaining a dark, visually appealing interface.
