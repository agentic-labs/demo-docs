## High-level description
The `Tooltip` component is a reusable UI element that displays a tooltip when hovering over a specified body element. It provides a customizable way to show additional information or context to users without cluttering the main interface.

## Code Structure
The `Tooltip` component is defined as a function that takes props including the tooltip content, direction, and the element to attach the tooltip to. It uses Solid.js primitives like `createSignal` and `createMemo` to manage its state and reactivity.

## Symbols

### Tooltip
#### Description
The main component function that renders a tooltip based on the provided props.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| body | JSX.Element | The element that triggers the tooltip on hover |
| tooltipText | string | The text content of the tooltip |
| direction | TooltipDirection | Optional. The direction in which the tooltip should appear |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates signals for managing the tooltip's visibility and position
2. Uses a memo to determine the tooltip's direction
3. Renders the body element with mouse event handlers
4. Conditionally renders the tooltip with appropriate positioning classes

## Side Effects
The component uses mouse events (enter/leave) to show/hide the tooltip, which affects the DOM by adding/removing elements.

## Performance Considerations
The use of `createMemo` for direction calculation helps optimize performance by caching the result and only recalculating when dependencies change.

## Dependencies
This component relies on Solid.js core libraries for reactivity and JSX rendering.

## Configuration
The component accepts a `direction` prop which can be customized to control the tooltip's placement relative to the body element.

## Error Handling
No explicit error handling is implemented in this component.

## Accessibility
The component does not include specific accessibility features, which could be an area for improvement (e.g., adding ARIA attributes).

Your response should not exceed 3000 words or 4000 tokens. Focus on providing clear, concise information that can be directly inferred from the code. Include optional sections only when they provide significant value for understanding the code.
