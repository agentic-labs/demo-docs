## High-level description
The `frontends/shared/ui` directory contains a collection of reusable UI components and utilities designed for use across different parts of the frontend application. These components include common UI elements like date pickers, modals, tooltips, and specialized components for JSON editing and display.

## What does it do?
This directory provides a set of shared UI components that can be used throughout the frontend application to maintain consistency and reduce code duplication. The components handle various user interface needs, such as:

1. Selecting dates or date ranges with a customizable picker
2. Displaying full-screen modal dialogs for focused content
3. Showing tooltips for additional information
4. Creating customizable tables for data display
5. Editing and viewing JSON data with syntax highlighting and validation
6. Implementing dropdown select boxes with search functionality

These components are designed to be flexible and customizable, allowing developers to easily integrate them into different parts of the application while maintaining a consistent look and feel.

## Key Files
1. `DateRangePicker.tsx`: A component for selecting date ranges with custom presets and granularity suggestions.
2. `FullscreenModal.tsx`: A reusable full-screen modal dialog component with customizable content and animations.
3. `JsonInput.tsx`: A JSON editor interface with real-time validation and error handling.
4. `JSONMetadata.tsx`: A collapsible JSON viewer for displaying structured data.
5. `SelectBox.tsx`: A customizable dropdown selection component with search functionality.
6. `Table.tsx`: A flexible table component for rendering tabular data with customizable styling.
7. `Tooltip.tsx`: A reusable tooltip component for displaying additional information on hover.
8. `AceTheme.ts`: A custom theme definition for the Ace editor used in JSON editing.

## Dependencies
The components in this directory primarily rely on the following external libraries and frameworks:

1. Solid.js: Used as the core library for building reactive UI components.
2. Terracotta: Provides UI components and utilities for dialogs and transitions.
3. JSONEditor: Used for creating an interactive JSON editing experience.
4. @rnwonder/solid-date-picker: The main library for the date picker component.
5. date-fns: Utilized for date manipulation utilities.
6. @nozbe/microfuzz: Implements fuzzy search functionality in the SelectBox component.

## Configuration
Many of the components in this directory accept configuration options through props, allowing for customization of appearance and behavior. For example:

- The `DateRangePicker` component accepts props for custom presets, initial selections, and granularity suggestions.
- The `FullscreenModal` component allows for customization of the title, icon, and additional CSS classes.
- The `JsonInput` component can be configured with custom themes and error handling callbacks.

Additionally, the `datePickerStyles.css` file provides custom styles for the date picker component, allowing for further visual customization.

These shared UI components form a foundation for building consistent and interactive user interfaces across the frontend application, promoting code reuse and maintaining a cohesive user experience.
