## High-level description
This file, `frontends/shared/ui/index.ts`, serves as an export module for various UI components used in the frontend of the application. It consolidates and re-exports components from different files, making it easier to import these components in other parts of the application.

## Symbols

### Exported Symbols
The file exports all symbols from the following modules:
1. `SelectBox`
2. `FullscreenModal`
3. `Tooltip`
4. `Table`
5. `DateRangePicker`
6. `JsonInput`
7. `JSONMetadata`

#### Description
This file uses the ES6 export syntax to re-export all symbols from each of the listed modules. This pattern is commonly used to create a single entry point for related components, simplifying imports in other parts of the application.

## Dependencies
The file indirectly depends on the following modules:
- `./SelectBox`
- `./FullscreenModal`
- `./Tooltip`
- `./Table`
- `./DateRangePicker`
- `./JsonInput`
- `./JSONMetadata`

Each of these modules likely contains one or more UI components or related utilities.

## Usage
To use the components exported by this file, other parts of the application can import them like this:

```typescript
import { Select, FullScreenModal, Tooltip, Table, DateRangePicker, JsonInput, JSONMetadata } from 'path/to/frontends/shared/ui';
```

This allows developers to import multiple UI components with a single import statement, rather than having to import each component from its individual file.

## Note
While this file doesn't contain any direct implementation, it plays a crucial role in organizing and simplifying the application's import structure for UI components. It acts as a centralized export point for shared UI components, promoting better code organization and easier maintenance.
