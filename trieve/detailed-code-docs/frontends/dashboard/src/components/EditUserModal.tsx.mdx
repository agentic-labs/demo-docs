## High-level description
This code defines an `EditUserModal` component in React using SolidJS. It allows administrators to edit the role of a user within an organization. The component displays a modal dialog with a form to change the user's role and handles the API call to update the user's role.

## Code Structure
The main component `EditUserModal` uses several hooks and utilities from SolidJS and other imported modules. It manages the state of the user's role, handles form submission, and interacts with the API to update the user's role.

## References
- `UserContext`: Used to access user and organization information
- `createToast`: Used to display notifications
- `SlimUser`, `UserRole`, and other type definitions from shared types
