## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `AddSampleDataModal` that provides functionality to add sample data to a dataset. It displays a modal dialog with confirmation and progress tracking for the data upload process.

## Code Structure
The main component `AddSampleDataModal` uses several hooks and components from SolidJS and Terracotta libraries. It manages the state of the upload process, including confirmation, progress, and status text. The component interacts with the `DatasetContext` and uses the `uploadSampleData` function from the API to perform the actual data upload.

### AddSampleDataModal
#### Description
A functional component that renders a modal dialog for adding sample data to a dataset.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| openModal | Accessor&lt;boolean&gt; | Controls the visibility of the modal |
| closeModal | () =&gt; void | Function to close the modal |
| addedDataCallback | () =&gt; void | Callback function to be called after data is added |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes state variables for confirmation, progress, and status text.
2. Defines `startUpload` function to initiate the upload process.
3. Defines `closeModal` function to reset state and close the modal.
4. Renders a dialog with two main sections:
   - Confirmation section (when not confirmed)
   - Upload progress section (when confirmed)

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| solid-js | For reactive state management and component rendering |
| terracotta | For UI components like Dialog, DialogOverlay, etc. |
| DatasetContext | To access the current dataset information |
| uploadSampleData | API function to perform the actual data upload |

## Error Handling
The component handles potential errors by setting an error status text if no dataset ID is found.

## Side Effects
The component interacts with external state through the `DatasetContext` and triggers data upload, which affects the server-side state.

## Performance Considerations
The component uses signals and accessors for reactive state management, which should provide efficient updates and rendering.
