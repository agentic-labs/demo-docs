## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `AddSampleDataModal` that provides a modal interface for adding sample data to a dataset. It handles the confirmation process, displays upload progress, and manages the state of the modal.

## Code Structure
The main component `AddSampleDataModal` uses several hooks and components from SolidJS and Terracotta UI library. It manages internal state for confirmation, progress, and status text. The component interacts with the `DatasetContext` and uses the `uploadSampleData` function from an external API module.

### AddSampleDataModal
#### Description
A functional component that renders a modal for adding sample data to a dataset.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| openModal | Accessor&lt;boolean&gt; | A function to check if the modal should be open |
| closeModal | () =&gt; void | A function to close the modal |
| addedDataCallback | () =&gt; void | A callback function to be called after data is added |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates signals for confirmation state, progress, and status text.
2. Defines a `startUpload` function that initiates the sample data upload process.
3. Defines a `closeModal` function to reset the modal state and close it.
4. Renders a modal with two main sections:
   - Confirmation dialog (when not confirmed)
   - Upload progress display (when confirmed)

## Side Effects
- Calls the `uploadSampleData` function, which makes API requests to upload data.
- Updates the progress and status text during the upload process.
- Calls the `addedDataCallback` function after a successful upload.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| solid-js | For reactive state management and component rendering |
| terracotta | For UI components (Dialog, DialogOverlay, DialogPanel, DialogTitle) |
| DatasetContext | To access the current dataset information |
| uploadSampleData | Function to handle the actual data upload process |

## Error Handling
The component checks for the presence of a dataset ID before starting the upload process. If no dataset ID is found, it sets an error status text.

This component provides a user-friendly interface for adding sample data to a dataset, with clear feedback on the upload progress and completion status.
