## High-level description
The `Sidebar` component is a crucial part of the dashboard interface, providing navigation and access to various tools and features. It displays a list of organizations, admin tools, and user information, allowing users to switch between organizations and access different functionalities.

## Code Structure
The `Sidebar` component is composed of several interconnected parts:
1. Environment variables for API and UI URLs
2. Context hooks for user and dataset information
3. State management for UI elements (e.g., modals, submenus)
4. Rendering of organization list, admin tools, and user information
5. Navigation and logout functionality

## Symbols

### `Sidebar`
#### Description
The main functional component that renders the sidebar interface.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't take any props.

#### Outputs
Returns a JSX element representing the sidebar UI.

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves environment variables for various UI URLs.
2. Uses `UserContext` and `DatasetContext` to access user and dataset information.
3. Manages local state for new organization modal and submenu visibility.
4. Creates a sorted list of user organizations.
5. Constructs URL parameters for organization and dataset.
6. Renders the sidebar UI with organizations list, admin tools, and user information.
7. Handles navigation between organizations and logout functionality.

### `sortedOrgs`
#### Description
A memoized function that sorts the user's organizations by creation date.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| sortedOrgs | Array | Sorted array of user organizations |

### `orgDatasetParams`
#### Description
A memoized function that constructs URL parameters for organization and dataset.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| orgDatasetParams | string | URL parameters string |

## Side Effects
- The component interacts with `localStorage` to persist the submenu visibility state.
- It uses the `fetch` API to send a logout request when the user clicks the logout button.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| solid-js | For reactive programming and component creation |
| @solidjs/router | For navigation within the application |
| solid-icons | For rendering various icons in the UI |
| ../contexts/UserContext | For accessing user-related data and functions |
| ../contexts/DatasetContext | For accessing dataset-related information |
| ./CreateNewOrgModal | For rendering the modal to create a new organization |

## Error Handling
The component includes basic error handling for the logout process, logging any errors to the console.

## Performance Considerations
The component uses `createMemo` for `sortedOrgs` and `orgDatasetParams` to optimize performance by memoizing these computations.

This Sidebar component is a central part of the dashboard's navigation and functionality, providing users with easy access to their organizations, admin tools, and account management options.
