## High-level description
The `Sidebar` component is a crucial part of the dashboard interface, providing navigation and user management functionality. It displays a list of organizations, admin tools, and user information, allowing users to switch between organizations, access various tools, and manage their session.

## Code Structure
The component is structured as a single functional component that uses various Solid.js primitives and hooks. It interacts with the `UserContext` and `DatasetContext` to manage state and user information. The component renders a sidebar with collapsible sections and external links to different tools and playgrounds.

## Symbols

### Sidebar
#### Description
The main component that renders the sidebar interface.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't take any props.

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves environment variables for API and UI URLs.
2. Uses `UserContext` and `DatasetContext` to access user and dataset information.
3. Manages local state for showing/hiding the new organization modal and submenu.
4. Creates a memoized list of sorted organizations.
5. Constructs URL parameters for external links.
6. Renders the sidebar structure with organizations list, admin tools, and user information.

#### Side Effects
- Stores the submenu state in localStorage.
- Navigates to different routes when an organization is selected.
- Opens external links in new tabs.
- Handles user logout by making an API call and redirecting to the logout URL.
