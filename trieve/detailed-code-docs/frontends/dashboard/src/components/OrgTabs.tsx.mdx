## High-level description
The `OrgTabs` component is a navigation bar for an organization's dashboard in a web application. It provides links to different sections of the dashboard, such as Overview, Users, Billing, API Keys, and Settings. The component uses the SolidJS framework and relies on the `UserContext` for organization-specific data.

## Code Structure
The `OrgTabs` component is a single function that returns JSX. It uses the `UserContext` to access the selected organization's ID and creates links to different dashboard sections using the `A` component from `@solidjs/router`.

## References
- `UserContext` from "../contexts/UserContext"
- `A` component from "@solidjs/router"

### OrgTabs
#### Description
This is the main and only component in the file. It creates a navigation bar with links to different sections of an organization's dashboard.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props.

#### Outputs
Returns a JSX element representing the navigation bar.

#### Internal Logic
1. The component uses the `useContext` hook to access the `UserContext`.
2. It creates a `currentOrgId` memo that returns the selected organization ID from the context.
3. The component returns a `div` containing multiple `A` components, each representing a link to a different dashboard section.
4. Each link's `href` is dynamically constructed using the selected organization ID and the specific section path.
5. The links use CSS classes for styling, including hover effects and an active state indicator.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @solidjs/router | Provides the `A` component for creating router links |
| solid-js | Provides core SolidJS functionality (createMemo, useContext) |

## Performance Considerations
The use of `createMemo` for `currentOrgId` ensures that the organization ID is only recalculated when the selected organization changes, potentially improving performance by avoiding unnecessary recalculations.
