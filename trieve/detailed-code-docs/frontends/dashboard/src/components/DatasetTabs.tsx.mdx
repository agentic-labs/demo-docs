## High-level description
The `DatasetTabs` component is a navigation element for a dataset dashboard in a React application. It renders a set of tabs that link to different sections of the dataset, such as Start, Events, API Keys, and Settings. The component uses the SolidJS framework and integrates with the application's routing system.

## Code Structure
The component imports necessary dependencies, retrieves the current organization ID from the user context, and renders a set of navigation links using the `A` component from SolidJS router.

## Symbols

### `DatasetTabs`
#### Description
This is the main functional component that renders the dataset navigation tabs.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props.

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the user context using `useContext(UserContext)`.
2. Gets URL parameters using `useParams()`.
3. Creates a memoized value for the current organization ID.
4. Renders four `A` components, each representing a tab and linking to a specific route.

#### Outputs
Returns a JSX element containing the navigation tabs.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @solidjs/router | For routing functionality (`A`, `useParams`) |
| solid-js | For React-like functionality in SolidJS (`createMemo`, `useContext`) |
| ../contexts/UserContext | For accessing user context data |

## Side Effects
This component doesn't have any direct side effects, but it relies on the `UserContext` for retrieving the selected organization ID.

## Performance Considerations
The component uses `createMemo` to memoize the `currentOrgId`, which can help optimize performance by preventing unnecessary re-computations of this value.

## Notes
1. The component uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling.
2. The `activeClass` prop on each `A` component defines the styling for the active tab.
3. The component dynamically constructs URLs for each tab using the `dataset_id` from URL parameters and the `currentOrgId`.
4. This component is likely used within a larger dashboard layout, possibly within the `DatasetLayout` component mentioned in the related code snippets.
