## High-level description
The `DatasetTabs` component is a navigation element for a dashboard interface, providing links to different sections of a dataset view. It uses SolidJS and the `@solidjs/router` for routing, and dynamically generates URLs based on the current organization and dataset.

## Code Structure
The component imports necessary dependencies, retrieves the user context and URL parameters, and renders a set of navigation links using the `A` component from `@solidjs/router`.

## Symbols

### `DatasetTabs`
#### Description
A functional component that renders a set of navigation tabs for different sections of a dataset view.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props.

#### Outputs
Returns a JSX element containing a set of navigation links.

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the user context using `useContext(UserContext)`.
2. Gets URL parameters using `useParams()`.
3. Creates a memoized value for the current organization ID.
4. Renders four navigation links using the `A` component, each pointing to a different section of the dataset view.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @solidjs/router | For routing functionality (`A` component and `useParams` hook) |
| solid-js | For reactive programming features (`createMemo`, `useContext`) |

## References
- `UserContext`: Imported from "../contexts/UserContext", used to access the current user's context.

## Side Effects
This component doesn't have any direct side effects, but it relies on the `UserContext` for determining the current organization ID.

## Performance Considerations
The component uses `createMemo` to memoize the current organization ID, which can help optimize performance by preventing unnecessary re-computations.

### `currentOrgId`
#### Description

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| currentOrgId | string \| undefined | The ID of the currently selected organization |

The `DatasetTabs` component is designed to be used within a larger dashboard interface, likely as part of the `DatasetLayout` component (as seen in the related `DatasetLayout.tsx` file). It provides a consistent navigation structure for different views of a dataset, including Start, Events, API Keys, and Settings pages. The component dynamically generates URLs based on the current dataset ID and organization ID, ensuring that navigation remains contextual to the user's current view and permissions.
