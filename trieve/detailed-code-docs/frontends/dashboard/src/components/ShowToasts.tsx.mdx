## High-level description
The `ShowToasts` component is responsible for displaying toast notifications on the dashboard. It listens for custom "show-toast" events dispatched by other components and renders toasts based on the event details. Each toast has a type, title, optional message, and timeout.

## Code Structure
The `ShowToasts` component uses the `createEffect` function from SolidJS to set up an event listener for "show-toast" events. When an event is received, it updates the `toastDetails` signal with the new toast details. A timeout is set to remove the toast after a specified duration. The component then uses the `For` component to iterate over the `toastDetails` signal and render each toast with appropriate styling and icons based on its type.

### `ShowToasts`
#### Description
This component listens for "show-toast" events and displays toast notifications accordingly.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
JSX Element representing the toast container.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Event Listener Setup:** A `createEffect` function sets up an event listener for "show-toast" events on the window.
2. **Toast Details Handling:** When a "show-toast" event is received:
    - The event details are extracted.
    - The `setToastDetails` function is used to update the `toastDetails` signal with the new toast details, ensuring no duplicate messages are added.
    - A timeout is set using `setTimeout` to remove the toast after a specified duration (default 1500ms or from the event detail).
3. **Toast Rendering:** The `For` component iterates over the `toastDetails` signal and renders each toast.
    - The toast styling and icons are determined based on the toast type ("success", "error", or "info").
    - A close button is provided to allow users to manually dismiss the toast.

## Side Effects
- **DOM Manipulation:** The component adds and removes toast elements from the DOM.
- **Event Listener:** The component adds and removes an event listener on the window.

## Dependencies
- **solid-js:** This library provides the core functionality for SolidJS, including `createEffect`, `createSignal`, `onCleanup`, `For`, and `Show`.
- **solid-icons:** This library provides the icons used for the toasts.

## Error Handling
The code does not implement specific error handling beyond basic exception raising.

## Logging
The code does not implement logging.
