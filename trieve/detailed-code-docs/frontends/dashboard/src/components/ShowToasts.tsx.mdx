## High-level description
The `ShowToasts` component is responsible for displaying toast notifications on the dashboard. It listens for custom "show-toast" events dispatched by other components and renders toasts based on the event details. Each toast has a type (success, error, or info), a title, an optional message, and an optional timeout.

## Code Structure
The `ShowToasts` component uses the `createEffect` function from SolidJS to set up an event listener for "show-toast" events. When an event is received, it extracts the toast details from the event and adds them to the `toastDetails` signal. A timeout is set to remove the toast after a specified duration. The component then uses the `For` component to iterate over the `toastDetails` signal and render each toast with appropriate styling and icons based on its type.

## References
- `createToast`: A function defined in the same file that dispatches a "show-toast" event with the provided toast details.

### `ShowToasts`
#### Description
A SolidJS component that listens for "show-toast" events and renders toast notifications.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
- A `div` element containing the rendered toasts.

#### Internal Logic
- Initializes a `toastDetails` signal to store the details of the toasts to be displayed.
- Uses `createEffect` to set up an event listener for "show-toast" events.
- When a "show-toast" event is received:
    - Extracts the toast details from the event.
    - Adds the toast details to the `toastDetails` signal, preventing duplicate toasts with the same message.
    - Sets a timeout to remove the toast after a specified duration (default 1500ms).
- Uses the `For` component to iterate over the `toastDetails` signal and render each toast.
- Renders each toast with appropriate styling and icons based on its type (success, error, or info).
- Provides a close button to manually dismiss the toast.
- Cleans up the event listener and timeout on component unmount.

## Dependencies
