## High-level description
The Codeblock component is a reusable UI element that renders syntax-highlighted code blocks using the Shiki library. It provides a copy-to-clipboard functionality and displays the code with proper formatting and styling.

## Code Structure
The main `Codeblock` component uses several Solid.js primitives and hooks to manage its state and side effects. It relies on the Shiki library for syntax highlighting and uses Solid Icons for the copy button.

### Codeblock
#### Description
A functional component that renders a syntax-highlighted code block with a copy-to-clipboard button.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| props | CodeblockProps | An object containing the content to be displayed in the code block |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a signal for tracking whether the code has been copied.
2. Uses a resource to asynchronously generate the highlighted HTML for the code.
3. Implements a copy-to-clipboard functionality.
4. Renders the code block with a conditional copy/check icon.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| solid-js | For creating reactive components and managing state |
| shiki | For syntax highlighting of code |
| solid-icons/fa | For copy and check icons |

## Error Handling
The component doesn't implement explicit error handling. However, it uses a `Show` component to conditionally render content, which can help prevent rendering errors if the code resource is not yet loaded.

## Performance Considerations
The component uses `createResource` to asynchronously load and highlight the code, which helps to avoid blocking the main thread for large code blocks.
