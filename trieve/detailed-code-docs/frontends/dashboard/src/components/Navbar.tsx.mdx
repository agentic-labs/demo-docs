## Code Structure
The main `NavBar` component is defined as a functional component using SolidJS. It uses the `UserContext` for user-related data and the `useNavigate` hook for navigation. The component renders a logo, an API docs link, and a help/contact popover menu.

### NavBar
#### Description
The `NavBar` component is the main export of this file. It creates a navigation bar with a logo, API documentation link, and a help/contact popover menu.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't take any props.

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the user context using `useContext(UserContext)`.
2. Sets up navigation using `useNavigate()`.
3. Renders a flex container with two main sections:
   - Left section: Logo and app name linked to the dashboard overview.
   - Right section: API docs link and help/contact popover menu.

#### Side Effects
The component uses the `UserContext` to access the selected organization ID, which affects the navigation link for the logo.
