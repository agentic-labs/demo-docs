## High-level description
The `DatasetName` component is a React component that displays the name of the current dataset. It utilizes the `DatasetContext` to access the dataset information and renders the dataset name within an `h3` element.

## Symbols

### DatasetName
#### Description
This is a functional component that retrieves the current dataset name from the `DatasetContext` and displays it.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props.

#### Outputs
Returns a JSX element containing the dataset name.

#### Internal Logic
1. The component uses the `useContext` hook to access the `DatasetContext`.
2. It creates a memoized value `curDatasetName` using `createMemo`:
   - Retrieves the current dataset from the context.
   - If the dataset exists, returns its name; otherwise, returns null.
3. Renders an `h3` element with the dataset name, appending " Dataset" to it.

## Code Structure
The `DatasetName` component is relatively simple and self-contained. It relies on the `DatasetContext` to access the current dataset information. The component is likely used within a larger application structure, possibly as part of a dataset management interface.

Based on the related code snippets:

1. The `DatasetContext` (from DatasetContext.tsx) provides the dataset information to this component.
2. The `DatasetLayout` component (from DatasetLayout.tsx) includes `DatasetName` as part of its layout structure, suggesting that `DatasetName` is used in the header section of dataset-related pages.

This structure allows for consistent display of the dataset name across different views or pages related to a specific dataset.
