### ProgressBar
#### Description
The `ProgressBar` component is a functional React component that renders a progress bar based on the provided props. It calculates the percentage of progress and displays it visually using styled div elements.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| max | number | The maximum value for the progress bar |
| progress | number | The current progress value |
| width | string (optional) | The width of the progress bar container (default: "100%") |

#### Outputs
The component returns a JSX element representing the progress bar.

#### Internal Logic
1. The component calculates the percentage of progress using the `percentage` function:
   - If `max` is less than or equal to 0, it returns 0.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the percentage as `(progress / max) * 100`.
   - The result is clamped between 0 and 100 using `Math.min` and `Math.max`.

2. The component renders two nested `div` elements:
   - The outer `div` represents the background of the progress bar.
   - The inner `div` represents the filled portion of the progress bar.

3. Styling is applied using Tailwind CSS classes and inline styles:
   - The outer `div` has a gray background and rounded corners.
   - The inner `div` has a magenta background, rounded corners, and a transition effect.
   - The width of the inner `div` is set dynamically based on the calculated percentage.

## Dependencies
The component uses React and TypeScript, as evident from the `.tsx` file extension and the use of TypeScript interfaces.

## References
The `ProgressBar` component is used in the `OrganizationUsageOverview` component (from the related code snippet) to display progress for various metrics such as file storage, message count, and chunk count.

## Performance Considerations
The component uses a transition effect (`transition-all duration-300 ease-in-out`) on the inner div, which provides a smooth animation when the progress changes. This may have a minor impact on performance if the progress is updated frequently.
