### `ProgressBar`
#### Description
The `ProgressBar` is a functional component that renders a progress bar based on the provided props. It calculates the percentage of progress and displays it visually using CSS styles.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| max | number | The maximum value for the progress bar |
| progress | number | The current progress value |
| width | string (optional) | The width of the progress bar container |

#### Internal Logic
1. The component calculates the percentage of progress using the `percentage` function:
   - If `max` is less than or equal to 0, it returns 0.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the percentage as `(progress / max) * 100`.
   - The result is clamped between 0 and 100 using `Math.min` and `Math.max`.

2. The component renders two nested `div` elements:
   - The outer `div` represents the background of the progress bar.
   - The inner `div` represents the filled portion of the progress bar.

3. Styling is applied using Tailwind CSS classes and inline styles:
   - The background color is set to gray in light mode and dark gray in dark mode.
   - The filled portion has a magenta background color.
   - A transition effect is applied to the filled portion for smooth updates.

#### Performance Considerations
The `percentage` calculation is memoized within the component, which can help optimize performance by avoiding unnecessary recalculations when the component re-renders without changes to `max` or `progress`.

## Dependencies
This component relies on React and Tailwind CSS for styling.

## References
The `ProgressBar` component is used in the `OrganizationUsageOverview` component (from the related code snippets) to display various usage metrics for an organization.

## API/Interface Reference
| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| max | number | - | The maximum value for the progress bar |
| progress | number | - | The current progress value |
| width | string | "100%" | The width of the progress bar container |

The component is flexible and can be easily integrated into other parts of the application where visual representation of progress is needed.
