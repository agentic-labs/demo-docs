## High-level description
This code defines the API routes and their corresponding HTTP methods for various endpoints in a dashboard application. It exports a type `RouteScope` and an object `ApiRoutes` that maps different API scopes to their respective endpoints.

## Code Structure
The code consists of two main parts:
1. The `RouteScope` type definition, which is derived from the keys of the `ApiRoutes` object.
2. The `ApiRoutes` object, which is a comprehensive mapping of API scopes to their corresponding endpoints.

## Symbols

### `RouteScope`
#### Description
A type that represents the keys of the `ApiRoutes` object, effectively creating a union type of all available API scopes.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| RouteScope | Type | A union type of all keys in the ApiRoutes object |

### `ApiRoutes`
#### Description
An object that maps API scopes to arrays of endpoint strings. Each endpoint string includes the HTTP method and the route path.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ApiRoutes | Object | A mapping of API scopes to arrays of endpoint strings |

#### Internal Logic
The `ApiRoutes` object is structured as follows:
- Each key represents an API scope (e.g., "api/analytics", "api/auth", etc.).
- The value for each key is an array of strings, where each string represents an endpoint in the format "HTTP_METHOD /api/path".
- The endpoints are grouped by their respective API scopes, making it easy to manage and reference related endpoints.

## Dependencies
This code doesn't have any external dependencies. It's a standalone definition of API routes.

## Usage in Related Code
The `ApiRoutes` and `RouteScope` are imported and used in the `ApiKeyGenerateModal` component (from the related code snippet) for the following purposes:

1. To populate the available routes in the API key generation form:
   ```typescript
   const availableRoutes = Object.keys(ApiRoutes).map((item, index) =&gt; ({
     id: `${index}`,
     name: item,
   }));
   ```

2. To construct the scopes for the API key when generating it:
   ```typescript
   scopes:
     selectedRoutes().length &gt; 0
       ? selectedRoutes()
           .map((route) =&gt; ApiRoutes[route.name as RouteScope])
           .flat()
       : undefined,
   ```

This usage demonstrates how the `ApiRoutes` object is utilized to provide a structured way of selecting and applying API scopes when generating API keys in the dashboard application.
