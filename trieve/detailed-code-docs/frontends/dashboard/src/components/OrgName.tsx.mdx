### OrgName
#### Description
`OrgName` is a functional component that retrieves the selected organization's information from the `UserContext` and displays its name.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props.

#### Outputs
Returns a JSX element displaying the selected organization's name.

#### Internal Logic
1. The component uses the `useContext` hook to access the `UserContext`.
2. It creates a memoized value `selectedOrganization` using `createMemo`:
   - Retrieves the `selectedOrganizationId` from the context.
   - If an ID is present, it finds the corresponding organization from the user's list of organizations.
3. The component renders an `h3` element with the organization's name, or nothing if no organization is selected.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| solid-js | Provides `createMemo` and `useContext` functions for state management and context usage |

## Code Structure
The `OrgName` component is a self-contained unit that relies on the `UserContext` to access user and organization data. It's designed to be used within a larger dashboard layout, likely as a child component in a header or navigation area.

## Performance Considerations
The use of `createMemo` ensures that the `selectedOrganization` is only recalculated when the `selectedOrganizationId` or the user's organization list changes, optimizing performance by avoiding unnecessary recalculations.
