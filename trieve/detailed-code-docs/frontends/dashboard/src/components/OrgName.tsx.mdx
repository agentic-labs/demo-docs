## Symbols

### `OrgName`
#### Description
This is a functional component that renders the name of the selected organization.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props.

#### Outputs
Returns a JSX element displaying the organization name.

#### Internal Logic
1. It uses the `useContext` hook to access the `UserContext`.
2. It creates a memoized value `selectedOrganization` using `createMemo`:
   - Retrieves the `selectedOrganizationId` from the context.
   - If an ID is present, it finds the corresponding organization from the user's list of organizations.
3. Renders an `h3` element with the organization name, or "Organization" if no organization is selected.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| solid-js | Provides `createMemo` and `useContext` functions for state management and context usage |
| ../contexts/UserContext | Provides the `UserContext` for accessing user-related data |

## References
- `UserContext`: Used to access the user's selected organization ID and list of organizations.

## Code Structure
The component is structured as a single function that combines context usage, memoization, and JSX rendering. It's a relatively simple component focused on displaying the organization name based on the current user context.

This component is part of a larger dashboard application, as evidenced by the related files. It's used within the `DashboardLayout` component (from `DashboardLayout.tsx`) to display the organization name in the dashboard header. The `UserContext` it relies on is defined in `UserContext.tsx`, which manages the global user state including the selected organization.

The component uses Solid.js, a reactive JavaScript library, as indicated by the use of `createMemo` and the project dependencies in `package.json`. It also utilizes Tailwind CSS for styling, as seen in the class names used in the JSX.
