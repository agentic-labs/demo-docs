## High-level description
This code defines a function `uploadSampleData` that uploads sample data to a Trieve dataset. It parses a CSV file, transforms the data, and sends it to the Trieve API in batches. The code also includes utility functions for data transformation and API communication.

## Code Structure
The main function `uploadSampleData` uses `Papa.parse` to read and process a CSV file. It then transforms each row using the `transformRow` function and sends the data to the Trieve API using the `sendDataToTrieve` function. The code also defines types for the input and output data structures.

## Symbols

### `sendDataToTrieve`
#### Description
This function sends transformed data to the Trieve API in batches.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| data | UploadDataArray | An array of arrays containing the transformed data to be sent |
| datasetId | string | The ID of the dataset to which the data will be uploaded |
| reportProgress | (progress: number) =&gt; void | Optional callback function to report upload progress |

#### Internal Logic
1. Iterates through the data array
2. Sends each batch to the Trieve API using a POST request
3. Reports progress if a callback function is provided

### `transformRow`
#### Description
Transforms a row of CSV data into the format expected by the Trieve API.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| row | { data: ChunkData } | A row of data from the CSV file |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| transformedRow | Data \| undefined | The transformed data row, or undefined if the row is invalid |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the row data is valid
2. Transforms the data, including:
   - Replacing semicolons with commas in certain fields
   - Splitting the tag set into an array
   - Parsing the metadata as JSON
3. Returns undefined if any error occurs during transformation

### `uploadSampleData`
#### Description
The main function that orchestrates the process of uploading sample data to a Trieve dataset.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| datasetId | string | The ID of the dataset to which the data will be uploaded |
| reportProgress | (progress: number) =&gt; void | Optional callback function to report upload progress |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Promise&lt;boolean&gt; | A promise that resolves to true if the upload is successful, or rejects with false if an error occurs |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes an array to store the data to be uploaded
2. Uses Papa.parse to download and parse a CSV file from a specified URL
3. Transforms each row of the CSV data using the `transformRow` function
4. Batches the transformed data into arrays of up to 120 items each
5. After parsing is complete, sends the data to the Trieve API using `sendDataToTrieve`
6. Resolves the promise with true if successful, or rejects with false if an error occurs

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Papa | Used for parsing CSV data |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| api_host | string | import.meta.env.VITE_API_HOST | The host URL for the Trieve API |

## Error Handling
The code includes basic error handling, such as skipping invalid rows during transformation and rejecting the promise if an error occurs during parsing or uploading.
