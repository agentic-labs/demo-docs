## High-level description
This directory contains API-related functionality for the dashboard frontend of the Trieve application. It includes modules for creating datasets, uploading sample data, and a centralized Trieve API client instance.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory facilitates communication between the dashboard frontend and the Trieve backend API. It provides functions for creating new datasets, uploading sample data to existing datasets, and a configured API client for making various API calls throughout the application.

1. Dataset Creation: It allows users to create new datasets by sending a POST request to the API with the dataset name and organization ID.
2. Sample Data Upload: It enables the upload of sample data to a dataset by parsing a CSV file, transforming the data, and sending it to the API in batches.
3. API Client: It provides a centralized, pre-configured Trieve API client instance for use throughout the dashboard application.

## Key Files

### createDataset.ts
This file contains the `createNewDataset` function, which handles the creation of new datasets. It sends a POST request to the API with the dataset information and handles the response, including error scenarios.

### uploadSampleData.ts
This file defines the `uploadSampleData` function, which is responsible for uploading sample data to a dataset. It uses the Papa Parse library to process a CSV file, transforms the data, and sends it to the Trieve API in batches.

### trieve.ts
This file exports an instance of the Trieve API client, configured with the base URL obtained from the environment. This client serves as the main interface for making API calls to the Trieve backend throughout the dashboard application.

## Dependencies
1. trieve-fetch-client: Used to create the Trieve API client instance.
2. Papa Parse: Utilized for parsing CSV data in the sample data upload process.

## Configuration
The code relies on the following environment variable:
- VITE_API_HOST: Specifies the base URL for API requests.

Example usage of the `createNewDataset` function:

```typescript
import { createNewDataset } from './api/createDataset';

const createDataset = async () =&gt; {
  try {
    const dataset = await createNewDataset('New Dataset', 'org123', serverConfig);
    console.log('Dataset created:', dataset);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error creating dataset:', error);
  }
};
```

Example usage of the `uploadSampleData` function:

```typescript
import { uploadSampleData } from './api/uploadSampleData';

const uploadData = async () =&gt; {
  try {
    const success = await uploadSampleData('dataset123', (progress) =&gt; {
      console.log(`Upload progress: ${progress}%`);
    });
    if (success) {
      console.log('Sample data uploaded successfully');
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error uploading sample data:', error);
  }
};
```

Example usage of the Trieve API client:

```typescript
import { trieve } from './api/trieve';

const fetchDatasets = async () =&gt; {
  try {
    const response = await trieve.listDatasets();
    console.log('Datasets:', response.data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching datasets:', error);
  }
};
```

These API-related functions and the centralized client provide a robust foundation for interacting with the Trieve backend, enabling the dashboard to perform essential operations such as dataset management and data upload.
