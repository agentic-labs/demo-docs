## High-level description
This code creates and exports an instance of the Trieve API client, configured with the base URL obtained from the environment variable `VITE_API_HOST`. It provides a centralized way to interact with the Trieve API throughout the dashboard application.

## Symbols

### `trieve`
#### Description
An instance of the `Trieve` class, initialized with the base URL for API requests. This object serves as the main interface for making API calls to the Trieve backend.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| baseUrl | string | The base URL for API requests, obtained from the `VITE_API_HOST` environment variable |

#### Internal Logic
The `trieve` object is created using the `Trieve` class constructor, which is imported from the "trieve-fetch-client" package. The constructor is called with an object containing the `baseUrl` property, which is set to the value of `VITE_API_HOST` environment variable.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| trieve-fetch-client | Provides the `Trieve` class for interacting with the Trieve API |

### Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| VITE_API_HOST | string | N/A | Environment variable containing the base URL for API requests |

## References
This code references the `Trieve` class from the "trieve-fetch-client" package. Based on the related code snippet provided, we can infer that the `Trieve` class is defined in the `clients/fetch-client/src/index.ts` file.

The `Trieve` class appears to be a comprehensive API client that handles various HTTP methods, request parameters, and response types. It includes features such as:

1. Type-safe request and response handling
2. Automatic conversion of camelCase to snake_case for path parameters
3. Setting of custom headers for dataset and organization IDs
4. Debug logging option
5. Error handling for non-OK responses

By creating an instance of this class with the appropriate base URL, the dashboard application can easily make API calls to the Trieve backend while benefiting from type safety and consistent error handling.
