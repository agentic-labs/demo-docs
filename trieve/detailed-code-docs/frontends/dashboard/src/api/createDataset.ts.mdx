## High-level description
The `createNewDataset` function is an asynchronous function that creates a new dataset in the application. It sends a POST request to the API endpoint with the dataset name, organization ID, and server configuration.

## References
- `Dataset`: Represents the structure of a dataset object.
- `DefaultError`: Represents the structure of an error object returned by the API.
- `ServerEnvsConfiguration`: Represents the server-side configuration for a dataset.

### `createNewDataset`
#### Description
This asynchronous function sends a POST request to the `/dataset` API endpoint to create a new dataset. It includes the dataset name, organization ID, and server configuration in the request body. If the request is successful, it returns the newly created `Dataset` object. Otherwise, it throws an error with the message from the API response.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `{ name, organizationId, serverConfig }` | object | An object containing the dataset name, organization ID, and server configuration. |
| name | string | The name of the new dataset. |
| organizationId | string | The ID of the organization that the dataset belongs to. |
| serverConfig | ServerEnvsConfiguration | The server-side configuration for the dataset. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Dataset | Promise\&lt;Dataset\&gt; | A promise that resolves to the newly created `Dataset` object if the request is successful. |

#### Internal Logic
1. **Construct API endpoint URL:** The function constructs the API endpoint URL using the `api_host` variable (imported from environment variables) and the `/dataset` path.
2. **Send POST request:** It sends a POST request to the constructed URL with the following:
    - `credentials: "include"` to include cookies in the request.
    - Headers:
        - `"Content-Type": "application/json"` to indicate the request body is in JSON format.
        - `"TR-Organization": organizationId` to specify the organization ID.
    - Body: A JSON string containing the `dataset_name`, `organization_id`, `server_configuration`, and an empty `client_configuration` object.
3. **Handle response:**
    - If the response is ok (status code 200-299), it parses the response body as JSON and returns the result as a `Dataset` object.
    - If the response is not ok, it parses the response body as a `DefaultError` object, throws a new error with the message from the error object.

## Side Effects
- This function makes an API call to create a new dataset, modifying the application's state.

## Dependencies
- `fetch`: Used to make the API request. This is a built-in browser API.

## Configuration
- `VITE_API_HOST`: An environment variable that defines the base URL of the API.

## Error Handling
- The function handles errors by catching any exceptions thrown during the API request. It then parses the error response from the API and throws a new error with the error message.
