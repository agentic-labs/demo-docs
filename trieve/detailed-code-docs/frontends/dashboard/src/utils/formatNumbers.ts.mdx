## High-level description
This TypeScript file contains utility functions for formatting numbers and storage sizes. It provides two main functions: one for adding commas to large numbers and another for converting storage sizes from megabytes to more readable formats (GB or TB).

## Symbols

### `formatNumberWithCommas`
#### Description
This function takes a number and returns a string representation of that number with commas inserted as thousand separators.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| num | number | The number to be formatted |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| formattedNumber | string | The input number as a string with commas as thousand separators |

#### Internal Logic
The function uses a regular expression to insert commas every three digits from right to left in the integer part of the number.

### `formatStorage`
#### Description
This function takes a storage size in megabytes and returns a formatted string representation in the most appropriate unit (MB, GB, or TB).

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mb | number | The storage size in megabytes |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| formattedStorage | string | The formatted storage size with appropriate unit |

#### Internal Logic
1. If the input is less than 1000 MB, it returns the value in MB.
2. If the input is between 1000 MB and 9000000000 MB (9000 GB), it converts to GB.
3. For values larger than 9000 GB, it converts to TB.
4. The function uses `formatNumberWithCommas` to format the numeric part of the result.

## References
The `formatNumberWithCommas` and `formatStorage` functions are used in the `OrganizationUsageOverview` component (from the related code snippet) to display formatted numbers for various usage metrics such as user count, file storage, message count, and chunk count.

## Performance Considerations
The `formatNumberWithCommas` function uses a regular expression, which may have performance implications for very large numbers or if called frequently. However, for typical use cases in a dashboard, this should not be a significant concern.

The `formatStorage` function uses fixed thresholds for unit conversion. While this is generally sufficient, it may not provide the most precise representation for edge cases (e.g., values very close to the thresholds).
