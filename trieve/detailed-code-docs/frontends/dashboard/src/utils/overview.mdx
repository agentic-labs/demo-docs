## High-level description
This directory contains utility functions used in the dashboard frontend of the Trieve AI system. The utilities focus on formatting and presenting data, as well as generating example code snippets for API requests. These functions are likely used across various components of the dashboard to ensure consistent data presentation and to provide helpful examples to users.

## What does it do?
The utility functions in this directory serve two main purposes:

1. Data Formatting: 
   - It provides functions to format large numbers by adding commas as thousand separators, making them more readable.
   - It also includes a function to format storage sizes, converting from megabytes to more appropriate units (MB, GB, or TB) based on the size.

2. Code Snippet Generation:
   - It contains functions that generate example API request strings for creating chunks and performing hybrid searches in the Trieve AI system.
   - These code snippets are likely used in the dashboard interface to provide users with examples of how to interact with the Trieve API.

These utilities enhance the user experience by presenting data in a more human-readable format and by providing practical examples of API usage, which can help users understand and interact with the Trieve AI system more effectively.

## Key Files

### createCodeSnippets.tsx
This file contains functions for generating example API request strings:

1. `createChunkRequest`: Generates a fetch request string for creating a chunk in the Trieve AI system. It includes headers and a sample body with AI-related content.

2. `hybridSearchRequest`: Generates a fetch request string for performing a hybrid search in the Trieve AI system. It includes headers and a sample search query.

Example usage of `createChunkRequest`:

```javascript
const snippetString = createChunkRequest("example-dataset-id");
console.log(snippetString);
// Output will be a fetch request string for creating a chunk
```

### formatNumbers.ts
This file provides utility functions for formatting numbers and storage sizes:

1. `formatNumberWithCommas`: Adds commas as thousand separators to large numbers.

2. `formatStorage`: Converts storage sizes from megabytes to more readable formats (MB, GB, or TB).

Example usage:

```typescript
console.log(formatNumberWithCommas(1000000)); // Output: "1,000,000"
console.log(formatStorage(5000)); // Output: "5 GB"
```

These formatting functions are likely used throughout the dashboard to display various metrics and data points in a user-friendly manner.

## Dependencies
The utility functions in this directory do not have any external dependencies. They are self-contained and rely only on native JavaScript/TypeScript functionality.

## Configuration
There are no specific configuration files or environment variables used in these utility functions. However, the code snippet generation functions use placeholder values for dataset IDs and authorization tokens, which would need to be replaced with actual values in a real-world scenario.

In conclusion, the `utils` directory provides essential formatting and code generation utilities that enhance the functionality and user experience of the Trieve AI dashboard. These functions ensure consistent data presentation and offer practical examples to help users interact with the Trieve API effectively.
