## High-level description
This directory contains utility functions for the dashboard frontend of the Trieve AI service. It includes functions for creating code snippets for API requests and formatting numbers and storage sizes. These utilities are designed to enhance the user experience and provide helpful tools for interacting with the Trieve AI API.

## What does it do?
The utilities in this directory serve two main purposes:

1. Code Snippet Generation: It provides functions that create example code snippets for developers. These snippets show how to make API requests to the Trieve AI service, specifically for creating new data chunks and performing hybrid searches. This helps developers quickly understand and implement interactions with the Trieve AI API.

2. Number Formatting: It offers functions to format numbers and storage sizes in a more readable way. Large numbers are formatted with commas as thousand separators, and storage sizes are converted from megabytes to more appropriate units (GB or TB) when necessary. This improves the readability of numerical data displayed in the dashboard.

These utilities work behind the scenes to make the dashboard more user-friendly and informative, both for developers looking to integrate with the Trieve AI API and for users viewing usage statistics and other numerical data.

## Key Files

1. `createCodeSnippets.tsx`:
   This file contains functions for generating code snippets that demonstrate how to interact with the Trieve AI API. It includes:
   - `createChunkRequest`: Generates a code snippet for creating a new chunk of data.
   - `hybridSearchRequest`: Generates a code snippet for performing a hybrid search.

   These functions create fetch request templates that include necessary headers and body structures for API calls. They use placeholder values for sensitive information like dataset IDs and authorization tokens.

2. `formatNumbers.ts`:
   This file provides utility functions for formatting numbers and storage sizes. It includes:
   - `formatNumberWithCommas`: Adds commas as thousand separators to large numbers.
   - `formatStorage`: Converts storage sizes from megabytes to more readable formats (MB, GB, or TB).

   These functions are used to improve the readability of numerical data displayed in the dashboard, particularly in components like `OrganizationUsageOverview`.

## Dependencies
The code in this directory implies the use of React, as indicated by the `.tsx` file extension in `createCodeSnippets.tsx`. However, no external libraries are explicitly imported or used in the provided code snippets.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files, both utility files use placeholder values for sensitive information:

- In `createCodeSnippets.tsx`:
  - Dataset ID: `"********-****-****-****-************"`
  - Authorization token: `"tr-********************************"`

These placeholders are used in the generated code snippets to indicate where actual values should be inserted when making real API requests.

The `formatStorage` function in `formatNumbers.ts` uses fixed thresholds for unit conversion:
- Values less than 1000 MB are displayed in MB
- Values between 1000 MB and 9000000000 MB (9000 GB) are displayed in GB
- Values larger than 9000 GB are displayed in TB

These thresholds determine how storage sizes are formatted and displayed in the dashboard.

In summary, this `utils` directory provides essential utility functions that enhance the functionality and user experience of the Trieve AI dashboard. It offers tools for developers to understand API interactions and improves the presentation of numerical data throughout the interface.
