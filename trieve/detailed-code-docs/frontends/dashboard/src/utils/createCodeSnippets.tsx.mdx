## High-level description
This code defines two functions, `createChunkRequest` and `hybridSearchRequest`, which generate example API request strings for creating chunks and performing hybrid searches in the Trieve AI system. These functions are likely used to provide code snippets or examples in a dashboard or documentation interface.

## Symbols

### `createChunkRequest`
#### Description
This function generates a string representation of a fetch request to create a chunk in the Trieve AI system.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| dataset | string | Optional. The dataset ID to be used in the request. Defaults to a placeholder value. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| (return value) | string | A string containing a JavaScript fetch request for creating a chunk. |

#### Internal Logic
1. The function uses a template string to construct the fetch request.
2. It includes headers for content type, dataset ID, and authorization.
3. The body of the request is a JSON string containing `chunk_html` and `link` properties.
4. The `chunk_html` contains a sample text about AI, and the `link` points to an HBO Silicon Valley page.

### `hybridSearchRequest`
#### Description
This function generates a string representation of a fetch request to perform a hybrid search in the Trieve AI system.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| dataset | string | Optional. The dataset ID to be used in the request. Defaults to a placeholder value. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| (return value) | string | A string containing a JavaScript fetch request for performing a hybrid search. |

#### Internal Logic
1. The function uses a template string to construct the fetch request.
2. It includes headers for content type, dataset ID, and authorization.
3. The body of the request is a JSON string containing `content` and `search_type` properties.
4. The `content` contains a sample search query, and the `search_type` is set to "hybrid".

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |

| None | This file does not import any external dependencies. |

## Notes
1. Both functions use placeholder values for the dataset ID and authorization token. In a real-world scenario, these would likely be replaced with actual values.
2. The code snippets generated by these functions are meant to be examples and would need to be modified with real credentials and data for actual use.
3. The `createChunkRequest` function includes a specific example of chunk content related to AI and Silicon Valley, which might be used for demonstration purposes.
4. The `hybridSearchRequest` function demonstrates a hybrid search, which likely combines different search techniques (e.g., semantic and keyword search) in the Trieve AI system.

These functions are likely used in conjunction with the `DatasetStart` component in the related file to provide example code snippets in the dashboard interface.
