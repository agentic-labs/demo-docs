## High-level description
This directory contains React context components that manage and provide essential data and functionality throughout the dashboard application. The two main contexts are the DatasetContext and UserContext, which handle dataset-related information and user authentication respectively.

## What does it do?
The contexts in this directory serve as central data stores and provide key functionality for the dashboard application:

1. DatasetContext:
   - Fetches and stores information about the current dataset being viewed or worked on.
   - Makes this dataset information available to other components in the application.
   - Handles errors that may occur during dataset fetching and displays notifications to the user.

2. UserContext:
   - Manages user authentication, including login and logout functionality.
   - Stores and provides access to the current user's information.
   - Handles organization selection for the user.
   - Provides loading states to indicate when user data is being fetched.

These contexts allow other components in the application to easily access and react to changes in dataset and user information without having to pass props through multiple levels of the component tree.

## Key Files

1. DatasetContext.tsx
   - Creates and exports the DatasetContext.
   - Implements the DatasetContextWrapper component, which fetches dataset information and provides it to child components.
   - Handles error cases and displays toast notifications for issues during dataset fetching.

2. UserContext.tsx
   - Creates and exports the UserContext.
   - Implements the UserContextWrapper component, which manages user authentication, organization selection, and provides user data to child components.
   - Handles login/logout functionality and persists user selection in local storage.

Both files use the Solid.js library for reactive state management and component creation.

## Dependencies
The contexts rely on the following main dependencies:

1. solid-js: Used for creating reactive components and managing state.
2. @solidjs/router: Used for accessing URL parameters and navigation.
3. shared/types: Provides type definitions for Dataset, SlimUser, and other shared types.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files, both contexts use environment variables and URL parameters for configuration:

1. DatasetContext:
   - Uses URL parameters to determine the current dataset ID.

2. UserContext:
   - Uses URL parameters for organization selection.
   - Uses localStorage to persist user selections.

Both contexts interact with API endpoints, which are likely configured elsewhere in the application.

In summary, this directory provides crucial data management and authentication functionality for the dashboard application through React contexts. These contexts centralize important application state and make it easily accessible throughout the component tree.
