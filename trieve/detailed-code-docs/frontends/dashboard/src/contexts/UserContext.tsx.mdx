## High-level description
The `UserContextWrapper` component provides a context for managing user-related data and actions within the dashboard application. It handles user login, organization selection, and loading state, making this information accessible to child components.

## Code Structure
The `UserContextWrapper` component defines a context (`UserContext`) and a wrapper component (`UserContextWrapper`). The wrapper component initializes the user store with signals for user data, selected organization, and loading state. It also defines functions for login and logout. The context is then provided to child components using the `UserContext.Provider`.

## References
- `UserContext`: A SolidJS context for storing and accessing user-related data.
- `SlimUser`: A type definition from the shared module representing a simplified user object.
- `createToast`: A function from the `ShowToasts` component for displaying toast notifications.

## Symbols

### `UserContextWrapper`
#### Description
This component wraps the application and provides a context for managing user-related data and actions. It handles user login, organization selection, and loading state.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| props | UserStoreContextProps | An object containing the children to be rendered within the context. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSX.Element | JSX.Element | A JSX element representing the wrapped application with the user context provided. |

#### Internal Logic
1. **Initialization:**
    - Defines signals for `user`, `selectedOrganizationId`, and `isLoading`.
    - Retrieves the API host from environment variables.
2. **Login Function (`login`):**
    - Sets `isLoading` to true.
    - Fetches user data from the `/auth/me` endpoint.
    - If the response status is 401 (Unauthorized), redirects the user to the login page.
    - If the response is successful, parses the JSON data and updates the `user` signal.
    - If an error occurs, logs the error and displays an error toast.
    - Sets `isLoading` to false.
3. **Organization Selection:**
    - Uses a `createEffect` to automatically select an organization based on the URL or user's organizations.
    - If no organization is found in the URL or user's organizations, triggers the `login` function.
4. **Context Provider:**
    - Creates a `userStore` object containing the user data, selected organization, loading state, and login/logout functions.
    - Provides the `userStore` to child components using the `UserContext.Provider`.
5. **Loading State:**
    - Uses a `Show` component to conditionally render a loading spinner while `isLoading` is true.

## Side Effects
- Modifies the `user`, `selectedOrganizationId`, and `isLoading` signals.
- Redirects the user to the login page if unauthorized.
- Displays toast notifications on login errors.

## Dependencies
- `solid-js`: A reactive JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- `shared/types`: A module containing shared type definitions, including `SlimUser`.
- `../components/ShowToasts`: A module containing the `createToast` function for displaying toast notifications.

## Error Handling
- Catches errors during the login process and displays an error toast.
- Logs errors to the console.

## Logging
- Logs errors during the login process to the console.
