## High-level description
This CSS file serves as the main stylesheet for the dashboard frontend. It incorporates Tailwind CSS utility classes and defines some custom styles for `&lt;pre&gt;` elements, particularly those with the class "shiki".

## Symbols

### Tailwind CSS Directives
#### Description
The file includes three Tailwind CSS directives that inject Tailwind's styles into the project.

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

These directives import Tailwind's base styles, component classes, and utility classes, respectively. They allow the project to use Tailwind's utility-first CSS framework.

### Pre Element Styles
#### Description
Custom styles are defined for `&lt;pre&gt;` elements, which are typically used for displaying preformatted text or code blocks.

```css
pre {
  overflow-x: auto;
  padding: 1rem 0;
}
```

This rule sets the following styles for all `&lt;pre&gt;` elements:
- `overflow-x: auto;`: Adds a horizontal scrollbar when the content overflows the element's width.
- `padding: 1rem 0;`: Adds 1rem (16px by default) of padding to the top and bottom of the element.

### Shiki Pre Element Styles
#### Description
Additional styles are applied to `&lt;pre&gt;` elements with the class "shiki", which likely refers to the Shiki syntax highlighter.

```css
pre.shiki {
  border-radius: 8px;
  padding-right: 14px;
  padding-left: 14px;
}
```

This rule sets the following styles for `&lt;pre&gt;` elements with the "shiki" class:
- `border-radius: 8px;`: Rounds the corners of the element with an 8px radius.
- `padding-right: 14px;`: Adds 14px of padding to the right side of the element.
- `padding-left: 14px;`: Adds 14px of padding to the left side of the element.
