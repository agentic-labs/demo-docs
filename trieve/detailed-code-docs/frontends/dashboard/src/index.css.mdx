## High-level description
This CSS file serves as the main stylesheet for the dashboard frontend. It incorporates Tailwind CSS utility classes and defines some custom styles for `&lt;pre&gt;` elements, particularly those with the class "shiki".

## Symbols

### Tailwind CSS Directives
#### Description
The file includes three Tailwind CSS directives that inject Tailwind's styles into the project.

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

These directives import Tailwind's base styles, component classes, and utility classes, respectively. They form the foundation of the project's styling system, allowing the use of Tailwind's utility-first approach throughout the application.

### Pre Element Styles
#### Description
Custom styles are defined for `&lt;pre&gt;` elements, which are typically used for displaying preformatted text or code blocks.

```css
pre {
  overflow-x: auto;
  padding: 1rem 0;
}
```

This rule ensures that `&lt;pre&gt;` elements have horizontal scrolling when their content exceeds the container width and adds vertical padding.

### Shiki Pre Element Styles
#### Description
Additional styles are applied to `&lt;pre&gt;` elements with the class "shiki", likely used for syntax-highlighted code blocks.

```css
pre.shiki {
  border-radius: 8px;
  padding-right: 14px;
  padding-left: 14px;
}
```

This rule adds rounded corners and horizontal padding to code blocks styled with the "shiki" class, improving their visual appearance.

## Notes
1. The use of Tailwind CSS suggests that the project employs a utility-first approach to styling, which can lead to more maintainable and consistent designs.
2. The custom styles for `&lt;pre&gt;` elements indicate that the dashboard likely includes sections for displaying code or preformatted text.
3. The specific styling for elements with the "shiki" class suggests the use of the Shiki syntax highlighter or a similar tool for code formatting and coloring.

This CSS file sets up the basic styling framework for the dashboard, combining the power of Tailwind CSS with custom styles for specific elements, particularly those related to code display.
