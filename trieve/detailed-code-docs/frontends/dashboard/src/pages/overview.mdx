It includes components for various sections such as the home page, billing, dataset management, overview, settings, and user management. These components work together to provide a comprehensive dashboard interface for managing an organization's data, users, and subscriptions.

## What does it do?
The pages in this directory implement several key functionalities:

1. Home: Redirects users to their organization-specific dashboard.
2. Billing: Displays subscription plans and invoices, allowing users to manage their organization's subscription.
3. Dataset Management: Provides tools for viewing dataset events, configuring dataset settings, and interacting with datasets.
4. Overview: Shows organization usage statistics and a list of datasets, with options to create, manage, and interact with datasets.
5. Settings: Allows users to update organization settings and perform administrative actions like deleting an organization.
6. User Management: Enables administrators to view, invite, edit, and remove users within an organization.

## Entry points
The main components in this directory are:

Example code snippet:
```typescript
const Home: Component = () =&gt; {
  const userContext = useContext(UserContext);

  createEffect(() =&gt; {
    const url = new URL(`${window.origin}/dashboard/${userContext.selectedOrganizationId}`);
    window.location.href = url.toString();
  });

  return &lt;div /&gt;;
};
```

## Dependencies
The components in this directory rely on several external libraries and frameworks:

1. SolidJS: Used for reactive state management and component rendering.
2. @solidjs/router: Provides routing functionality.
3. solid-icons: Supplies icon components for the UI.
4. shared/types: Provides type definitions used across the application.
5. shared/ui: Offers shared UI components.
6. terracotta: Used for UI components like Dialog.

## Configuration
The components use various environment variables for configuration, including:

- `VITE_API_HOST`: The API host URL for making server requests.
- `VITE_BM25_ACTIVE`: Determines whether BM25 settings should be displayed.
- `VITE_ANALYTICS_UI_URL`: URL for the analytics UI.
- `VITE_SEARCH_UI_URL`: URL for the search UI.
- `VITE_CHAT_UI_URL`: URL for the chat UI.

These environment variables are used to configure API endpoints and feature toggles within the components.

The components interact with several API endpoints for fetching and updating information, managing users, and performing administrative actions. Some key endpoints include:

- `/organization`: For updating organization information and managing users.
- `/dataset`: For managing datasets and their settings.
- `/invitation`: For handling user invitations.

Overall, this directory provides a comprehensive set of components for managing various aspects of an organization's dashboard, including billing, datasets, settings, and user management. The components are designed to work together seamlessly, providing a cohesive user experience for managing an organization's data and resources.
