## High-level description
This code defines a `Home` component in a SolidJS application. Its primary purpose is to redirect the user to a specific dashboard URL based on the selected organization ID from the user context.

## Symbols

### `Home`
#### Description
The `Home` component is a functional component that uses the `UserContext` to access the selected organization ID and redirects the user to the corresponding dashboard URL.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props.

#### Internal Logic
1. It retrieves the `UserContext` using the `useContext` hook.
2. It uses a `createEffect` to perform a side effect when the component renders.
3. Inside the effect, it constructs a new URL using the current `window.origin`, appending `/dashboard/` and the selected organization ID.
4. It then redirects the user to this new URL by setting `window.location.href`.
5. The component renders an empty `&lt;div /&gt;` as its visual representation.

## Side Effects
The main side effect of this component is the redirection of the user's browser to a new URL. This happens as soon as the component mounts and the effect runs.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| solid-js | Provides the `createEffect` and `useContext` functions for managing side effects and accessing context. |
| ../contexts/UserContext | Provides the `UserContext` for accessing user-related data, specifically the selected organization ID. |

## References
- `UserContext`: This context is imported from "../contexts/UserContext" and is used to access the user's selected organization ID.
- `window.origin`: Used to construct the base URL for redirection.
- `window.location.href`: Used to perform the actual redirection.

## Notes
1. The component doesn't handle cases where `selectedOrganizationId` might be undefined or null. It's assumed that this value will always be available when the component renders.
2. The component doesn't provide any visual feedback during the redirection process, as it renders an empty div.
3. This component essentially acts as a router, automatically redirecting users to their dashboard based on their selected organization.
