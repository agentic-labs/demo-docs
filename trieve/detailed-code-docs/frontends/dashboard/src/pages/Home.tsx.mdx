## High-level description
The `Home` component in this file serves as a redirection mechanism. It automatically redirects the user to a specific dashboard URL based on the selected organization ID from the user context.

## Code Structure
The `Home` component uses the `UserContext` to access the selected organization ID and then uses a `createEffect` to perform the redirection.

## References
- `UserContext` from "../contexts/UserContext"

### `Home`
#### Description
The `Home` component is a functional component that redirects the user to a specific dashboard URL. It uses the `UserContext` to get the selected organization ID and then updates the window location to redirect the user.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props.

#### Outputs
This component doesn't return any visible UI elements. It renders an empty `&lt;div /&gt;` while performing the redirection.

#### Internal Logic
1. The component uses the `useContext` hook to access the `UserContext`.
2. It then uses `createEffect` to set up a side effect that will run after the component renders.
3. Inside the effect, it constructs a new URL using the current `window.origin` and the `selectedOrganizationId` from the user context.
4. The `window.location.href` is then set to this new URL, causing the browser to navigate to the dashboard page for the selected organization.

## Side Effects
The main side effect of this component is the browser redirection. It changes the current URL, which causes the browser to load a new page.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| solid-js | Provides the `createEffect` and `useContext` functions for managing component effects and accessing context |

## Performance Considerations
The redirection happens immediately after the component renders, which means the empty `&lt;div /&gt;` might not be visible to the user. This approach ensures a quick transition to the dashboard page.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this component. If the `selectedOrganizationId` is undefined or null, it might result in an invalid URL. It would be beneficial to add a check for this scenario and handle it appropriately.

## TODOs
Consider adding error handling for cases where `selectedOrganizationId` is not available or invalid.
