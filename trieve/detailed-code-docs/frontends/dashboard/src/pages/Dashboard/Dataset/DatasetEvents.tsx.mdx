## High-level description
The `DatasetEvents` component displays a table of events logged by the server for a specific dataset. It allows filtering events by type and refreshes the event list every 5 seconds. The component also provides pagination to navigate through large sets of events.

## Code Structure
The `DatasetEvents` component fetches event data from the server and displays it in a table. It uses signals to manage the state of events, pagination, loading, and selected event types. The component also uses an interval to periodically refresh the event list.

## References
- `DatasetContext`: Provides access to the selected dataset's ID.
- `Event`, `isEvent`, `isEventDTO`: Types for event data.
- `MultiSelect`: Component for selecting event types to filter by.

## Symbols
### `DatasetEvents`
#### Description
A SolidJS component that displays a table of events for a specific dataset, allowing filtering by event type and providing pagination.

#### Inputs
This symbol does not take any inputs.

#### Outputs
This symbol does not return any specific outputs. It renders the UI for the Dataset Events page.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Initialization:**
   - Retrieves the API host from environment variables.
   - Accesses the `DatasetContext` to get the selected dataset's ID.
   - Initializes signals for events, page number, page count, loading state, and selected event types.
   - Sets up an interval to call `getEvents` every 5 seconds.
   - Calls `getEvents` to initially fetch the event data.
   - Cleans up the interval when the component unmounts.

2. **`getEvents` function:**
   - Fetches event data from the server using the `fetch` API.
   - Sends a POST request to `/events` endpoint with the selected event types and current page number.
   - Updates the `events`, `pageCount`, and `loading` signals based on the response.

3. **UI Rendering:**
   - Displays an informational message about the event log.
   - Renders a `MultiSelect` component for filtering events by type.
   - Renders a table to display the fetched events.
     - Shows a loading indicator while fetching data.
     - Displays "No events found" if no events are available.
     - Iterates through the `events` signal to render each event row.
     - Provides a button to expand/collapse long event metadata.
   - Renders pagination controls to navigate through the event pages.

## Side Effects
- Fetches data from the server at regular intervals.
- Updates the component's state based on the fetched data.
