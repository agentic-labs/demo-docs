The component also includes modals for adding sample data and displays tooltips for additional information.

## Symbols

### `DatasetStart`
#### Description
The main functional component that renders the dataset start page.

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes various signals and memos for managing state.
2. Fetches dataset usage information.
3. Provides functionality to reload chunk count and update the dataset's tracking ID.
4. Renders different sections of the page, including dataset information, usage statistics, and code examples.

### `reloadChunkCount`
#### Description
A function to reload the chunk count for the current dataset.

#### Internal Logic
1. Fetches updated usage data for the dataset.
2. Updates the UI with the new chunk count.
3. Displays a toast notification with the result.

### `updateDataset`
#### Description
An asynchronous function to update the dataset's tracking ID.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sends a PUT request to update the dataset.
2. Displays a toast notification with the result.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| solid-js | For reactive programming and component rendering |
| @solidjs/router | For routing functionality |
| shared/types | For type definitions |
| shared/ui | For UI components like Tooltip |

## Configuration
The component uses several environment variables:
| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| VITE_API_HOST | string | API host URL |
| VITE_ANALYTICS_UI_URL | string | Analytics UI URL |
| VITE_SEARCH_UI_URL | string | Search UI URL |
| VITE_CHAT_UI_URL | string | Chat UI URL |

## Side Effects
- Fetches dataset usage information on component mount.
- Updates the dataset's tracking ID when requested.
- Reloads chunk count when requested.

## Performance Considerations
The component uses `createResource` for fetching dataset usage, which helps in efficient data loading and caching. It also uses `createMemo` for derived state calculations, which can help optimize performance by memoizing computed values.

## Error Handling
The component uses toast notifications to display errors, such as when failing to fetch dataset usage or update the dataset.

## Logging
The component includes console error logging for invalid dataset IDs.

This component is crucial for providing an overview of a dataset and offering initial actions for users to interact with the dataset in the dashboard.
