## High-level description
This code implements a user management interface for a dashboard application. It allows administrators to view, invite, edit, and remove users within an organization. The component handles user roles, invitations, and provides functionality to manage user permissions.

## Code Structure
The main `UserManagement` component contains several sub-components and functions that work together to provide user management functionality. It uses the `UserContext` for accessing and updating user-related data, and includes modals for inviting new users and editing existing user roles.

## Dependencies
The component relies on several external libraries and components:
- SolidJS for reactivity and component structure
- `UserContext` for user-related data and operations
- `InviteUserModal` and `EditUserModal` for user management actions
- `createToast` for displaying notifications
- Various utility functions and types from the `shared/types` module

## Error Handling
The component implements error handling for API requests, displaying toast notifications for errors such as unauthorized access or failed operations.

## Performance Considerations
The component fetches user and invitation data on mount and when certain actions are performed. Consider implementing pagination or lazy loading for large lists of users to improve performance.
