## High-level description
This code represents the Overview page of a dashboard for managing datasets within an organization. It displays a list of datasets, allows creating new datasets, and provides various actions for each dataset such as viewing analytics, searching, chatting, and managing settings. The page also shows organization usage statistics and includes a component for building something new.

## Code Structure
The main components in this file are:
1. `Overview`: The main component that renders the entire page.
2. `NewDatasetModal`: A modal for creating a new dataset.
3. `DatasetOverview`: Displays the list of datasets and their details.
4. `OrganizationUsageOverview`: Shows usage statistics for the organization.
5. `BuildingSomething`: A component that encourages users to share their projects.

These components interact with each other and use various hooks and context providers to manage state and fetch data.
