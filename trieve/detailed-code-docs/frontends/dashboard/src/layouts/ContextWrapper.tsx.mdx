## High-level description
The `ContextWrapper` component is a higher-order component that wraps its children with two context providers: `UserContextWrapper` and `DatasetContextWrapper`. This component is responsible for providing user and dataset-related context to the entire application, enabling child components to access and manipulate shared state.

## Code Structure
The `ContextWrapper` component is a simple functional component that nests two context providers. The `UserContextWrapper` is the outermost wrapper, followed by the `DatasetContextWrapper`, which then wraps the children props.

## Symbols

### ContextWrapper
#### Description
The `ContextWrapper` is a functional component that serves as a container for context providers. It wraps its children with `UserContextWrapper` and `DatasetContextWrapper`, providing access to user and dataset-related state throughout the application.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| props | ContextWrapperProps | An object containing the children to be wrapped |

#### Outputs
The component returns JSX that wraps the children with context providers.

#### Internal Logic
1. The component returns JSX wrapped in a fragment (`&lt;&gt;...&lt;/&gt;`).
2. It first wraps the children with `UserContextWrapper`.
3. Inside `UserContextWrapper`, it wraps the children with `DatasetContextWrapper`.
4. Finally, it renders the `props.children` inside the `DatasetContextWrapper`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| solid-js | Provides the JSX type used in the component props |
| ../contexts/UserContext.tsx | Imports the UserContextWrapper component |
| ../contexts/DatasetContext.tsx | Imports the DatasetContextWrapper component |

## References
The `ContextWrapper` is used in the main routing setup of the application, as seen in the `frontends/dashboard/src/index.tsx` file. It wraps the entire application, ensuring that all routes have access to both user and dataset contexts.

```typescript
&lt;Route path="/" component={ContextWrapper}&gt;
  {/* Other routes */}
&lt;/Route&gt;
```

This setup allows all child components within the application to access the user and dataset context when needed, providing a centralized state management solution for these key pieces of data.
