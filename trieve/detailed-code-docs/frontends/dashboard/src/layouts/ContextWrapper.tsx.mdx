## High-level description
The `ContextWrapper` component is a crucial part of the application's state management system. It wraps the entire application with context providers, specifically the `UserContextWrapper` and `DatasetContextWrapper`, to make user and dataset information globally accessible to child components.

## Code Structure
The `ContextWrapper` component is a simple functional component that nests two context providers: `UserContextWrapper` and `DatasetContextWrapper`. The `children` prop is passed down through these wrappers, allowing the wrapped components to access the context data.

## Symbols

### ContextWrapper
#### Description
`ContextWrapper` is a functional component that serves as a container for context providers. It wraps the application's components with `UserContextWrapper` and `DatasetContextWrapper` to provide global state management for user and dataset information.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| props | ContextWrapperProps | An object containing the children to be wrapped |

#### Outputs
The component returns JSX that wraps the children with context providers.

#### Internal Logic
1. The component receives `children` as a prop.
2. It wraps the children with `UserContextWrapper`.
3. Inside `UserContextWrapper`, it further wraps the children with `DatasetContextWrapper`.
4. The nested structure ensures that both user and dataset contexts are available to all child components.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| solid-js | Provides the JSX type used in the component props |
| ../contexts/UserContext.tsx | Imports the UserContextWrapper component |
| ../contexts/DatasetContext.tsx | Imports the DatasetContextWrapper component |

## References
This component is used in the main application structure, as seen in the `frontends/dashboard/src/index.tsx` file, where it wraps the entire Router component:

```typescript
&lt;Route path="/" component={ContextWrapper}&gt;
  {/* Other routes */}
&lt;/Route&gt;
```

This ensures that all routes and components within the application have access to both the user and dataset contexts.

The `UserContextWrapper` and `DatasetContextWrapper` components (imported from their respective files) are responsible for managing the actual context state and providing it to their children. The `ContextWrapper` component simply combines these two context providers in a specific order to create a complete context environment for the application.
