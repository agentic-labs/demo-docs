## High-level description
The `DashboardLayout` component is a layout wrapper for the dashboard pages in a web application. It provides a common structure including a navigation bar, sidebar, and content area. The component handles user authentication, organization selection, and conditional rendering based on user roles and loading states.

## Code Structure
The main `DashboardLayout` component uses several sub-components and contexts:
- `NavBar`: Renders the top navigation bar
- `Sidebar`: Renders the sidebar with organization and navigation options
- `OrgName`: Displays the selected organization name
- `OrgTabs`: Renders tabs for different organization-related pages
- `ShowToasts`: Handles displaying toast notifications
- `UserContext`: Provides user-related data and functions

The component uses SolidJS's reactive primitives like `createEffect`, `createMemo`, and `Switch/Match` for conditional rendering.

## Symbols

### DashboardLayout
#### Description
The main layout component for the dashboard pages.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| children | JSX.Element | The content to be rendered in the main area of the layout |

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses `UserContext` to access user and organization data
2. Handles navigation and URL parsing for organization selection
3. Implements conditional rendering based on user role and loading state
4. Renders the layout structure with `NavBar`, `Sidebar`, and content area

## Side Effects
- Navigates to different URLs based on the current path and selected organization
- Updates the selected organization based on the URL

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| solid-js | Core library for reactive UI components |
| @solidjs/router | Routing library for navigation |

## Error Handling
The component handles various edge cases:
- Redirects to the overview page if the dashboard URL is incomplete
- Displays a message if the user is not part of any organization
- Shows an access denied message if the user doesn't have sufficient permissions

## API/Interface Reference
This component doesn't expose an API but relies on the `UserContext` for data and functions related to user authentication and organization selection.
