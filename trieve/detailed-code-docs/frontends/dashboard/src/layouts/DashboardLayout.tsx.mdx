## High-level description
The `DashboardLayout` component is a layout wrapper for the dashboard pages in a web application. It provides a common structure including a navigation bar, sidebar, and content area. The component handles user authentication, organization selection, and conditional rendering based on user roles and loading states.

## Code Structure
The main component `DashboardLayout` uses several sub-components and contexts:
- `NavBar`: Renders the top navigation bar
- `Sidebar`: Renders the sidebar with organization and navigation options
- `OrgName`: Displays the selected organization name
- `OrgTabs`: Renders tabs for different organization-related pages
- `ShowToasts`: Handles displaying toast notifications
- `UserContext`: Provides user-related data and functions

The component uses `createEffect` to handle navigation and organization selection logic.
