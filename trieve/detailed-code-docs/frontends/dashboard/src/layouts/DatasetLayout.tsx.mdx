### DatasetLayout
#### Description
A functional component that creates a layout structure for dataset pages.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| props | DatasetLayoutProps | Contains optional children elements to be rendered within the layout |

#### Outputs
Returns a JSX element representing the entire layout structure.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses `useLocation` and `useNavigate` hooks for routing.
2. Implements a `createEffect` to handle navigation when the URL path has exactly 4 sections.
3. Renders a structure containing `ShowToasts`, `NavBar`, `Sidebar`, `DatasetName`, `DatasetTabs`, and the children passed as props.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| solid-js | For creating reactive components and effects |
| @solidjs/router | For routing functionality |
| ../components/* | Various components used in the layout |

## References
This component references and uses several other components:
- NavBar
- ShowToasts
- Sidebar
- DatasetName
- DatasetTabs

These components are imported from the `../components/` directory and are crucial for understanding the complete functionality of the DatasetLayout.

## Notes
- The layout uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling.
- The component is responsive, using flex layout and overflow handling for different screen sizes.
- The navigation effect ensures that if a URL with exactly 4 sections is accessed, it redirects to a "/start" sub-route.
