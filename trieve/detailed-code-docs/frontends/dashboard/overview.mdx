## High-level description
This directory contains the source code for a dashboard frontend application built with Solid.js, TypeScript, and Vite. The dashboard is designed to manage datasets, organizations, and user accounts for a data management system. It includes features for user authentication, API key management, billing, and usage statistics visualization.

## What does it do?
The dashboard frontend provides a comprehensive interface for users to interact with a data management system. Key functionalities include:

1. User authentication and authorization
2. Organization and dataset management
3. API key generation and management
4. User invitation and role management
5. Billing and subscription management
6. Usage statistics visualization
7. Dataset creation, configuration, and monitoring

The application uses SolidJS for reactive UI components, context providers for state management, and custom hooks for data fetching and pagination. It also includes utility functions for formatting data and generating code snippets for API interactions.

## Entry points
The main entry point for the application is `src/index.tsx`, which sets up the routing structure and renders the root component. Key entry points within the application include:

1. `src/pages/Home.tsx`: The initial landing page that redirects users to their organization's dashboard.
2. `src/pages/Dashboard/Overview.tsx`: The main dashboard page showing an overview of datasets and usage.
3. `src/layouts/DashboardLayout.tsx`: The primary layout component for dashboard pages.
4. `src/layouts/DatasetLayout.tsx`: The layout component for dataset-specific pages.

## Key Files
1. `src/index.tsx`: Sets up the application routing and renders the root component.
2. `src/contexts/UserContext.tsx`: Manages user authentication and organization selection.
3. `src/contexts/DatasetContext.tsx`: Provides dataset information to components.
4. `src/components/DatasetOverview.tsx`: Displays an overview of datasets for an organization.
5. `src/components/ApiKeyGenerateModal.tsx`: Handles the creation of new API keys.
6. `src/components/InviteUserModal.tsx`: Manages user invitations to organizations.
7. `src/hooks/useDatasetPages.ts`: Custom hook for dataset pagination and searching.
8. `src/utils/createCodeSnippets.tsx`: Generates code snippets for API interactions.
9. `src/utils/formatNumbers.ts`: Provides utility functions for formatting numbers and storage sizes.

## Dependencies
The application relies on several key dependencies:

1. SolidJS: Core framework for building reactive user interfaces.
2. @solidjs/router: Handles routing within the application.
3. solid-icons: Provides icons for the user interface.
4. Papa Parse: Used for parsing CSV data in sample data uploads.
5. Shiki: Used for syntax highlighting in code blocks.
6. Terracotta: Offers UI components like Dialog, Listbox, and Popover.
7. Sentry: Used for error tracking in non-development environments.
8. Vite: Build tool and development server.
9. ESLint and Prettier: For code linting and formatting.
10. TypeScript: For static typing and improved developer experience.

## Configuration
The application uses environment variables for configuration, including:

1. `VITE_API_HOST`: Specifies the base URL for API requests.
2. `VITE_SENTRY_DASHBOARD_DSN`: Sentry Data Source Name for error tracking.
3. `VITE_ANALYTICS_UI_URL`, `VITE_SEARCH_UI_URL`, `VITE_CHAT_UI_URL`: URLs for various UI functionalities.

These variables are managed using the `vite-plugin-runtime-env` plugin, allowing for flexible deployment to different environments without code changes.

The project is configured using several key files:

1. `vite.config.ts`: Configures Vite for the project, including plugins for Solid.js and runtime environment variables.
2. `tsconfig.json`: Specifies TypeScript compiler options, extending a base configuration.
3. `.eslintrc.json`: Configures ESLint for code linting, including rules for TypeScript and Solid.js.
4. `package.json`: Defines project metadata, scripts, and dependencies.

The application also uses context providers (UserContext and DatasetContext) for managing global state and configuration options.

In summary, this dashboard frontend provides a comprehensive interface for managing datasets, organizations, and users within a data management system. It leverages modern web technologies and practices to create a responsive and efficient user experience, with a focus on type safety, code quality, and developer productivity.
