title: "tsconfig.json"
---

## High-level description
This file is a TypeScript configuration file (`tsconfig.json`) specifically for the dashboard frontend of the project. It extends a base configuration and includes some custom settings for the TypeScript compiler.

## Code Structure
The configuration is a JSON object with three main properties: `extends`, `compilerOptions`, and `include`.

## Symbols

### `extends`
#### Description
This property specifies that the current configuration extends another TypeScript configuration file.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| extends | string | Path to the base configuration file |

The value "config/tsconfig" indicates that this configuration extends a base configuration located at "config/tsconfig".

### `compilerOptions`
#### Description
This property specifies compiler options that are specific to the dashboard frontend.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| noUnusedLocals | boolean | Disables the error reporting for unused local variables |

The `noUnusedLocals` option is set to `false`, which means the TypeScript compiler will not report errors for unused local variables in the dashboard frontend code.

### `include`
#### Description
This property specifies which files should be included in the compilation.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| include | string[] | Array of file or directory patterns to include |

The value `["src"]` indicates that all TypeScript files in the `src` directory (and its subdirectories) should be included in the compilation.

## Dependencies
This configuration file depends on the base TypeScript configuration file located at "config/tsconfig".

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| noUnusedLocals | boolean | false | Disables error reporting for unused local variables |

Note: The `noUnusedLocals` option is explicitly set to `false` in this configuration, which may differ from the base configuration.
