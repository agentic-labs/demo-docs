title: "Dockerfile"
---

## High-level description
This Dockerfile defines a multi-stage build process for a dashboard application. It first builds the application using Node.js, then creates a lightweight Nginx-based image to serve the built static files. The final image includes custom Nginx configuration and a script to inject environment variables into the HTML file at runtime.

## Code Structure
The Dockerfile is structured in two main stages:
1. Build stage: Uses Node.js to build the dashboard application.
2. Production stage: Uses Nginx to serve the built static files.

## Symbols

### Build Stage
#### Description
This stage prepares the development environment and builds the dashboard application.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses `node:18` as the base image
2. Sets the working directory to `/app`
3. Copies package files, yarn lock, and turbo configuration
4. Copies the `frontends` and `clients/ts-sdk` directories
5. Installs dependencies using Yarn
6. Builds the dashboard application using Turbo

### Production Stage
#### Description
This stage creates the final lightweight image to serve the built application.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses `nginx:1.25.4-alpine-slim` as the base image
2. Copies the built files from the build stage to Nginx's HTML directory
3. Adds a custom Nginx configuration for serving single-page applications
4. Adds a script to inject environment variables into the HTML file at runtime
5. Sets execute permissions for the injection script
6. Exposes port 80

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Node.js | Used for building the application |
| Nginx | Used for serving the static files |
| Yarn | Package manager for installing dependencies |
| Turbo | Build system for the dashboard application |

## Configuration
The Dockerfile includes two inline configuration files:

1. Nginx configuration (`/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf`):
   - Listens on port 80
   - Sets the root directory to `/usr/share/nginx/html`
   - Configures URL rewriting for single-page applications

2. Environment variable injection script (`/docker-entrypoint.d/01-insert-window-variable.sh`):
   - Creates a template from the original `index.html`
   - Uses `envsubst` to replace environment variables in the template
   - Overwrites the original `index.html` with the processed version

## Side Effects
- The original `index.html` file is modified at runtime to include environment variable values.

## Performance Considerations
- The multi-stage build process helps keep the final image size small by excluding build tools and dependencies.
- Using the Alpine-based Nginx image further reduces the final image size.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the Dockerfile.
