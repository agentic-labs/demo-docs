## High-level description
The `frontends` directory contains the source code for multiple frontend applications and shared resources that make up the Trieve application suite. It includes separate subdirectories for analytics, chat, dashboard, and search interfaces, as well as shared components and configurations. The frontends are primarily built using SolidJS, TypeScript, and modern web technologies.

## What does it do?
The frontends in this directory collectively provide a comprehensive user interface for the Trieve application, offering the following key functionalities:

1. Analytics Dashboard: Visualizes search and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) performance data, including usage graphs, latency trends, and query statistics.

2. Chat Interface: Provides an interactive chat application with message history, user input, and AI-assisted response generation.

3. Admin Dashboard: Manages datasets, organizations, user accounts, API keys, and billing information.

4. Search Interface: Offers a powerful search functionality with filters, document management, file uploads, and group organization.

5. Shared Resources: Provides common components, utilities, and configurations used across the different frontend applications.

These frontends work together to create a cohesive user experience for managing, searching, and analyzing data within the Trieve ecosystem.

## Entry points
Each frontend application has its own entry points:

1. Analytics: `frontends/analytics/src/index.tsx`
2. Chat: `frontends/chat/src/index.tsx`
3. Dashboard: `frontends/dashboard/src/index.tsx`
4. Search: `frontends/search/src/index.tsx`

The shared resources are typically imported into these main applications as needed.

## Key Files
1. `frontends/analytics/src/components/`: Contains components for visualizing analytics data.
2. `frontends/chat/src/components/Layouts/MainLayout.tsx`: Main layout for the chat interface.
3. `frontends/dashboard/src/pages/Dashboard/Overview.tsx`: Main dashboard overview page.
4. `frontends/search/src/components/HomeSearch.tsx`: Primary search interface component.
5. `frontends/shared/types.ts`: Shared TypeScript definitions used across frontends.
6. `frontends/config/`: Contains shared configuration files for TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Prettier.

## Dependencies
The frontend applications share many common dependencies, including:

1. SolidJS: Core framework for building reactive user interfaces.
2. TypeScript: For static typing and improved developer experience.
3. Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
4. Vite: Build tool and development server.
5. ESLint and Prettier: For code linting and formatting.
6. Sentry: For error tracking and monitoring in production.

Each frontend may have additional specific dependencies based on its functionality.

## Configuration
The frontends use various configuration methods:

1. Environment Variables: Each frontend uses environment variables for API hosts, feature flags, and external service configurations.

2. Vite Configuration: `vite.config.ts` files in each frontend directory configure the build process and development server.

3. TypeScript Configuration: `tsconfig.json` files specify compiler options, often extending a shared base configuration.

4. ESLint and Prettier: Configuration files in each frontend and the shared config directory maintain code quality and style consistency.

5. Context Providers: Many frontends use context providers for managing global state and configuration options.

The `frontends/config` directory provides shared configurations that can be extended or imported by individual frontend applications, ensuring consistency across the suite while allowing for application-specific customizations.

This modular structure allows for independent development and deployment of each frontend application while sharing common resources and maintaining a consistent user experience across the Trieve application suite.
