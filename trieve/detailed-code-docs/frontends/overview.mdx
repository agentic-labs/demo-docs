## High-level description
The `frontends` directory contains the source code for various frontend applications and shared resources within the Trieve project. It includes separate subdirectories for analytics, chat, dashboard, and search interfaces, as well as shared components and configurations. The frontends are primarily built using Solid.js, a reactive JavaScript library, and utilize modern web development practices such as TypeScript, component-based architecture, and responsive design.

## What does it do?
The frontends in this directory collectively provide a comprehensive user interface for interacting with the Trieve AI system. The main functionalities include:

1. Analytics Dashboard: Visualizes search performance metrics, usage statistics, and trends.
2. Chat Interface: Implements an interactive chat application for communicating with the AI system.
3. Main Dashboard: Offers tools for managing datasets, organizations, API keys, and billing.
4. Search Interface: Provides advanced search capabilities with document management features.
5. Shared Resources: Contains reusable components, types, and utilities used across different frontends.

These applications work together to offer users a complete ecosystem for leveraging Trieve's AI capabilities, from data management and search to analytics and chat interactions.

## Entry points
Each frontend application has its own entry points, typically including:

1. `src/index.tsx`: The main entry point for each application, setting up routing and rendering the root component.
2. Various page components in `src/pages/`: Serve as entry points for different views within each application.
3. Layout components like `src/layouts/DashboardLayout.tsx`: Provide consistent structure across pages.

The shared directory doesn't have a specific entry point but exports components and utilities for use in other frontends.

## Key Files
1. API client configurations (e.g., `src/api/trieve.ts` or `src/utils/trieve.ts`): Set up communication with the Trieve backend.
2. Context providers (e.g., `src/contexts/UserContext.tsx`): Manage global state for user information and other shared data.
3. Reusable UI components in `components/` directories: Implement common interface elements.
4. Utility functions in `src/utils/`: Provide helper functions for data formatting, API interactions, and other common tasks.
5. Configuration files: Include `tsconfig.json`, `.eslintrc.json`, and `vite.config.ts` for each frontend.

## Dependencies
The frontends share several common dependencies:

1. Solid.js: Core library for building reactive user interfaces.
2. @solidjs/router: Handles client-side routing.
3. TypeScript: Provides static typing and improved developer experience.
4. Tailwind CSS: Used for utility-first styling.
5. trieve-fetch-client: Client library for interacting with Trieve's API.
6. Vite: Build tool and development server.
7. ESLint and Prettier: Ensure code quality and consistent formatting.

Additional dependencies specific to each frontend are used for features like charting (chart.js), date handling (date-fns), and error tracking (Sentry).

## Configuration
The frontends use a combination of configuration approaches:

1. Environment variables: Accessed via `import.meta.env.VITE_*` for API URLs and feature flags.
2. TypeScript configurations: Each frontend has its own `tsconfig.json`, often extending a base configuration.
3. ESLint configurations: Defined in `.eslintrc.json` files, setting up linting rules for TypeScript and Solid.js development.
4. Vite configurations: `vite.config.ts` files set up the build process for each frontend.
5. Shared configurations: The `frontends/config` directory provides shared settings for TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Prettier.

Key configurable aspects include API endpoints, feature flags, and build settings. The use of shared configurations promotes consistency across the different frontend applications while allowing for application-specific customizations when needed.

In summary, the `frontends` directory houses a suite of interconnected web applications that provide a comprehensive interface for the Trieve AI system. These applications share common technologies and practices while maintaining separate codebases for distinct functionalities, allowing for modular development and maintenance of the overall Trieve user experience.
