## High-level description
This directory contains TypeScript examples demonstrating various functionalities of the Trieve API. It includes a set of scripts that showcase different operations such as searching, uploading data, creating datasets and groups, and fetching recommendations. The directory is structured as a Node.js package with TypeScript configuration and dependencies.

## What does it do?
The examples in this directory provide developers with practical demonstrations of how to interact with the Trieve platform using the `trieve-fetch-client` library. The scripts cover a range of common tasks:

1. Performing advanced and simple searches within a dataset
2. Uploading text chunks and files (including PDFs) to a dataset
3. Creating new chunk groups
4. Setting up a new organization and dataset
5. Fetching recommendations based on existing chunks

Each script focuses on a specific task, demonstrating how to structure API requests, handle responses, and utilize the Trieve client library effectively. These examples serve as a starting point for developers looking to integrate Trieve functionality into their TypeScript projects.

## Entry points
The main entry points for the examples are the TypeScript files located in the `src` directory. Each file contains a `main` function that encapsulates the core logic for a specific Trieve API operation. The `trieve.ts` file serves as a common configuration point, exporting a pre-configured Trieve client instance and a sample dataset ID used across the examples.

The typical data flow in these examples follows this pattern:
1. Import the Trieve client and necessary constants from `trieve.ts`
2. Define a `main` function that performs the specific API operation
3. Send requests to the Trieve API using the client
4. Process and log the API responses

## Key Files
1. `src/advancedSearch.ts`: Demonstrates complex search queries with filters and pagination.
2. `src/chunkUpload.ts`: Shows how to upload text chunks with metadata to a dataset.
3. `src/createGroup.ts`: Illustrates the process of creating a new chunk group within a dataset.
4. `src/createOrgAndDataset.ts`: Guides through the steps of setting up a new organization and dataset.
5. `src/fileUpload.ts`: Provides an example of uploading a PDF file to the Trieve platform.
6. `src/recommendations.ts`: Showcases how to fetch recommendations based on existing chunks.
7. `src/simpleSearch.ts`: Demonstrates a basic fulltext search within a dataset.
8. `src/trieve.ts`: Contains the shared Trieve client configuration used across all examples.
9. `package.json`: Defines the project dependencies and scripts for running the examples.
10. `tsconfig.json`: Configures the TypeScript compiler options for the project.

## Dependencies
The primary dependency for all examples is the `trieve-fetch-client` library, which provides the `Trieve` class for interacting with the Trieve API. Other dependencies include:

- `esbuild`: A fast JavaScript bundler used for building and bundling the TypeScript example code.
- `esbuild-register`: Allows registering `.ts` files with esbuild for on-the-fly transpilation, enabling direct execution of TypeScript code with Node.js.
- `typescript`: The TypeScript compiler and language support for writing type-safe JavaScript code.

## Configuration
The `trieve.ts` file serves as the central configuration point for all examples. It exports a configured `Trieve` client instance and a sample dataset ID:

```typescript
export const trieve = new Trieve({
  apiKey: "admin",
  baseUrl: "http://localhost:8090",
  debug: false,
});

export const EXAMPLE_DATASET_ID = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000";
```

The `package.json` file defines several scripts for running the TypeScript examples:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "create-dataset": "node -r esbuild-register src/createOrgAndDataset.ts",
    "create-group": "node -r esbuild-register src/createGroup.ts",
    "upload-chunk": "node -r esbuild-register src/chunkUpload.ts",
    "upload-file": "node -r esbuild-register ./src/fileUpload.ts",
    "simple-search": "node -r esbuild-register ./src/simpleSearch.ts",
    "advanced-search": "node -r esbuild-register ./src/advancedSearch.ts",
    "recommendations": "node -r esbuild-register ./src/recommendations.ts"
  }
}
```

The `tsconfig.json` file configures the TypeScript compiler with the following key options:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "es2016",
    "module": "commonjs",
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
    "strict": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true
  }
}
```

These configurations enable developers to easily run and modify the examples for their specific use cases, providing a comprehensive starting point for integrating Trieve into TypeScript projects.
