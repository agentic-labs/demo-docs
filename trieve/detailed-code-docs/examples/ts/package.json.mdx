## High-level description
This file is a `package.json` file that defines a Node.js package for Trieve TypeScript examples. It specifies dependencies, scripts for running example code, and metadata like the package name and version.

## Symbols
### `package.json`
#### Description
This file defines the configuration for a Node.js package that provides TypeScript examples for interacting with the Trieve API. It includes scripts for running various examples, such as creating datasets, uploading files, and performing searches.

#### Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `trieve-fetch-client` | Provides a client library for interacting with the Trieve API using the Fetch API. |
| `esbuild` | A fast JavaScript bundler used for building and bundling the TypeScript example code. |
| `esbuild-register` | Allows registering `.ts` files with esbuild for on-the-fly transpilation, enabling direct execution of TypeScript code with Node.js. |
| `typescript` | The TypeScript compiler and language support for writing type-safe JavaScript code. |

#### Configuration
This `package.json` file defines several scripts for running the TypeScript examples:

| Script | Command | Description |
|:-------|:--------|:------------|
| `create-dataset` | `node -r esbuild-register src/createOrgAndDataset.ts` | Creates a new organization and dataset in Trieve. |
| `create-group` | `node -r esbuild-register src/createGroup.ts` | Creates a new group within a Trieve organization. |
| `upload-chunk` | `node -r esbuild-register src/chunkUpload.ts` | Demonstrates uploading data to Trieve in chunks. |
| `upload-file` | `node -r esbuild-register ./src/fileUpload.ts` | Uploads a file to a Trieve dataset. |
| `simple-search` | `node -r esbuild-register ./src/simpleSearch.ts` | Performs a simple search query against a Trieve dataset. |
| `advanced-search` | `node -r esbuild-register ./src/advancedSearch.ts` | Demonstrates more complex search queries with filters and parameters. |
| `recommendations` | `node -r esbuild-register ./src/recommendations.ts` | Shows how to retrieve recommendations from a Trieve dataset. |

Each script uses `esbuild-register` to enable direct execution of TypeScript code by Node.js.
