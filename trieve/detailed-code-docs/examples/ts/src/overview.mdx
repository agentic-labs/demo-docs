## High-level description
This directory contains TypeScript examples demonstrating various functionalities of the Trieve API. The examples cover operations such as advanced search, chunk upload, group creation, organization and dataset creation, file upload, recommendations, and simple search. These scripts serve as practical demonstrations of how to interact with the Trieve platform using the `trieve-fetch-client` library.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory provides developers with working examples of common tasks when using the Trieve API:

1. Performing advanced and simple searches within a dataset
2. Uploading text chunks and files to a dataset
3. Creating new chunk groups
4. Setting up a new organization and dataset
5. Fetching recommendations based on existing chunks

Each script focuses on a specific task, demonstrating how to structure API requests, handle responses, and utilize the Trieve client library effectively.

## Entry points
The main entry point for each example is the `main` function defined in each TypeScript file. These functions encapsulate the core logic for interacting with the Trieve API. The `trieve.ts` file serves as a common configuration point, exporting a pre-configured Trieve client instance and a sample dataset ID used across the examples.

The data flow typically follows this pattern:
1. Import the Trieve client and necessary constants from `trieve.ts`
2. Define a `main` function that performs the specific API operation
3. Send requests to the Trieve API using the client
4. Process and log the API responses

## Key Files
1. `advancedSearch.ts`: Demonstrates complex search queries with filters and pagination.
2. `chunkUpload.ts`: Shows how to upload text chunks with metadata to a dataset.
3. `createGroup.ts`: Illustrates the process of creating a new chunk group within a dataset.
4. `createOrgAndDataset.ts`: Guides through the steps of setting up a new organization and dataset.
5. `fileUpload.ts`: Provides an example of uploading a PDF file to the Trieve platform.
6. `recommendations.ts`: Showcases how to fetch recommendations based on existing chunks.
7. `simpleSearch.ts`: Demonstrates a basic fulltext search within a dataset.
8. `trieve.ts`: Contains the shared Trieve client configuration used across all examples.

## Dependencies
The primary dependency for all examples is the `trieve-fetch-client` library. This library provides the `Trieve` class, which is used to interact with the Trieve API. The examples assume a local Trieve instance running on `http://localhost:8090`.

Other standard Node.js modules used include:
- `fs`: For file system operations in the file upload example.

## Configuration
The `trieve.ts` file serves as the central configuration point for all examples. It exports:

1. A configured `Trieve` client instance:
   ```typescript
   export const trieve = new Trieve({
     apiKey: "admin",
     baseUrl: "http://localhost:8090",
     debug: false,
   });
   ```

2. A sample dataset ID used across examples:
   ```typescript
   export const EXAMPLE_DATASET_ID = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000";
   ```

Developers should modify these values to match their specific Trieve setup and target dataset.

Each example script can be run independently, demonstrating a specific aspect of the Trieve API. They all follow a similar structure:

1. Import the necessary dependencies and configurations.
2. Define a `main` function that encapsulates the example logic.
3. Call the `main` function to execute the example.

For instance, the `simpleSearch.ts` file demonstrates a basic search operation:

```typescript
import { trieve, EXAMPLE_DATASET_ID } from "./trieve";
import { SearchResponseBody } from "trieve-fetch-client";

async function main() {
  const searchResult = await trieve.fetch&lt;SearchResponseBody&gt;({
    url: "/api/chunk/search",
    method: "post",
    data: {
      query: "Hello",
      search_type: "fulltext",
    },
    datasetId: EXAMPLE_DATASET_ID,
  });

  console.log(searchResult.chunks);
}

main();
```

This structure allows developers to easily understand and modify the examples for their specific use cases. The examples cover a wide range of Trieve API functionalities, providing a comprehensive starting point for integrating Trieve into TypeScript projects.
