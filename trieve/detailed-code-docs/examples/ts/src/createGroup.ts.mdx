## High-level description
This code demonstrates how to create a new chunk group within a specific dataset using the Trieve API. It defines an asynchronous function `main` that sends a POST request to the `/api/chunk_group` endpoint with the group name and dataset ID.

## References
- `trieve`: This symbol is imported from `./trieve.ts` and represents an instance of the `Trieve` client used to interact with the Trieve API.
- `EXAMPLE_DATASET_ID`: This symbol is imported from `./trieve.ts` and represents the ID of the dataset where the new chunk group will be created.

## Symbols
### `main`
#### Description
This asynchronous function demonstrates the process of creating a new chunk group using the Trieve API.

#### Inputs
This function has no inputs.

#### Outputs
This function has no explicit outputs. It logs the created group object to the console.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Sends a request to create a chunk group:**
   - Uses `trieve.fetch` to send a POST request to the `/api/chunk_group` endpoint.
   - The request body includes:
     - `name`: "Test Group" (the name of the new group).
     - `datasetId`: `EXAMPLE_DATASET_ID` (the ID of the dataset).
2. **Logs the response:**
   - Logs the response from the API (the created group object) to the console.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| trieve-fetch-client | Provides the `Trieve` class for interacting with the Trieve API. |

## Logging
The code uses `console.log` to print the created group object to the console.
