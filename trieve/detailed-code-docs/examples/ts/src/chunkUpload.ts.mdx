## High-level description
This code demonstrates how to upload a text chunk to a Trieve dataset using the `trieve-fetch-client` library. It sends a POST request to the `/api/chunk` endpoint with the chunk content and metadata.

## References
- `trieve`: Imported from `./trieve.ts`, an instance of the `Trieve` client.
- `EXAMPLE_DATASET_ID`: Imported from `./trieve.ts`, a string representing the ID of the target dataset.

## Symbols

### `main`
#### Description
This asynchronous function demonstrates the process of uploading a text chunk to a Trieve dataset.

#### Inputs
This function takes no inputs.

#### Outputs
This function has no explicit return value. It logs the uploaded chunk data to the console.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Prepare Chunk Data:** Defines an object containing the chunk's text content (`chunk_html`) and associated metadata (`user`).
2. **Upload Chunk:** Calls `trieve.fetch` to send a POST request to the `/api/chunk` endpoint. The request includes the chunk data, dataset ID (`EXAMPLE_DATASET_ID`), and other options.
3. **Log Response:** Logs the response from the server, which represents the uploaded chunk, to the console.
