## High-level description
This TypeScript code demonstrates a simple fulltext search using the Trieve API. It searches for chunks containing the word "Hello" within a specific dataset and logs the found chunks to the console.

## References
- `trieve`: An instance of the `Trieve` class from the `trieve-fetch-client` library, pre-configured with API key and base URL.
- `EXAMPLE_DATASET_ID`: A constant representing the ID of the dataset to search within.
- `SearchResponseBody`: A type imported from `trieve-fetch-client` that defines the structure of the search response.

## Symbols
### `main`
#### Description
This asynchronous function performs the main logic of the script. It sends a search request to the Trieve API and processes the response.

#### Inputs
This function takes no direct inputs. It relies on the globally defined `trieve` and `EXAMPLE_DATASET_ID` variables.

#### Outputs
This function doesn't return any values. It logs the found chunks to the console.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Sends a search request:**
   - Uses `trieve.fetch` to send a POST request to the `/api/chunk/search` endpoint.
   - The request body specifies a `fulltext` search for the query "Hello" within the `EXAMPLE_DATASET_ID` dataset.
   - The response is explicitly typed as `SearchResponseBody`.
2. **Processes the response:**
   - Accesses the `chunks` property of the `searchResult` object, which contains an array of matching chunks.
   - Logs the `chunks` array to the console.
