## High-level description
This code instantiates a `Trieve` client object, which is used to interact with the Trieve API. It sets up the client with specific configuration parameters like API key, base URL, and debug mode. Additionally, it defines a constant `EXAMPLE_DATASET_ID` for potential use in API requests.

## References
- `Trieve` from `trieve-fetch-client`

## Symbols
### `trieve`
#### Description
This symbol represents an instance of the `Trieve` client class, configured to connect to a local Trieve API instance. It uses the "admin" API key and disables debug logging.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a variable declaration, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a variable declaration, not a function.

#### Internal Logic
This line instantiates a new `Trieve` object with the following configuration:
- `apiKey`: "admin" - This sets the API key for authentication with the Trieve API.
- `baseUrl`: "http://localhost:8090" - This specifies the base URL for the Trieve API.
- `debug`: `false` - This disables debug logging for the client.

### `EXAMPLE_DATASET_ID`
#### Description
This constant stores a string literal representing a dataset ID. This ID is likely used in subsequent API calls to interact with a specific dataset within the Trieve system.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a constant declaration, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a constant declaration, not a function.
