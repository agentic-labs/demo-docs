title: "rules.yaml"
---

## High-level description
This configuration file defines custom linting rules for OpenAPI Specification (OAS) files within the project. It disables the `paths-kebab-case` rule, allowing for flexibility in path naming conventions.

## Symbols
### `extends`
#### Description
This field specifies that the configuration should inherit rules from the `spectral:oas,recommended` preset. This preset likely includes a set of recommended linting rules for OAS files.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a configuration field, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a configuration field, not a function.

### `rules`
#### Description
This field defines custom rule overrides for the linting process.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a configuration field, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a configuration field, not a function.

#### Internal Logic
- `paths-kebab-case: false`: This line disables the `paths-kebab-case` rule, which likely enforces kebab-case naming for paths in OAS definitions. Setting it to `false` allows developers to use different naming conventions for paths.

## Dependencies
- **spectral**: This configuration file is likely parsed by a linting tool called Spectral (https://spectral.stoplight.io/). Spectral is a popular tool for linting OAS (OpenAPI Specification) files.

## Configuration
This file itself serves as the configuration for the linting process. The `extends` and `rules` fields define the specific rules and presets to be applied.
