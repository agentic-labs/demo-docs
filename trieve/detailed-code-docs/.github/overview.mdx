## High-level description
This `.github` directory contains configuration files and workflows for GitHub-specific features and automation processes for the Trieve project. It includes issue templates, pull request templates, linting rules, and GitHub Actions workflows that automate various aspects of the development process, including testing, Docker image building, and documentation deployment.

## What does it do?
The contents of this directory serve several purposes:

1. Standardize issue reporting and pull request submissions through templates.
2. Define API linting rules using Spectral for maintaining API design consistency.
3. Automate frontend and backend testing processes.
4. Build and push Docker images for various components of the application.
5. Deploy TypeScript SDK documentation to GitHub Pages.
6. Ensure code quality and maintain up-to-date Docker images as the project evolves.

These automations and configurations streamline the development workflow, enforce coding standards, and facilitate consistent communication within the project.

## Key Files

1. `ISSUE_TEMPLATE/issue_template.md`: Provides a standardized format for creating new issues, including sections for description, targets, requirements to close, and community channels for assistance.

2. `pull_request_template.md`: Offers a simple template for pull requests, prompting contributors to link related issues and mention relevant maintainers.

3. `rules.yaml`: Configures Spectral, an API linting tool, extending the recommended OpenAPI Specification ruleset and disabling the `paths-kebab-case` rule.

4. `workflows/`: Contains several GitHub Actions workflow files:
   - `frontend-tests.yml`: Runs build tests and linting checks on frontend applications.
   - `rust-tests.yml`: Performs formatting checks, linting, and OpenAPI specification generation for the Rust server code.
   - `push-frontends.yml` and `push-server.yml`: Build and push Docker images for frontend and server components.
   - `ts-sdk-gh-pages.yml`: Builds and deploys TypeScript SDK documentation to GitHub Pages.
   - `push-clickhouse.yml` and `push-clustering-script.yml`: Create Docker images for Clickhouse and a clustering script.

## Dependencies
The workflows in this directory rely on several GitHub Actions and external tools:

1. `actions/checkout@v4`
2. Docker-related actions: `docker/setup-buildx-action@v3`, `docker/login-action@v3`, `docker/metadata-action@v5`, `docker/build-push-action@v5`
3. `useblacksmith/cache@v5`
4. `clechasseur/rs-clippy-check@v3`
5. GitHub Pages deployment actions: `actions/configure-pages@v3`, `actions/upload-pages-artifact@v1`, `actions/deploy-pages@v1`
6. Spectral: API linting tool used in the `rules.yaml` configuration

## Configuration
The workflows and configurations in this directory use various settings:

1. Environment secrets: `DOCKER_USERNAME` and `DOCKER_PASSWORD` for Docker Hub authentication.
2. GitHub secrets: `GITHUB_TOKEN` for GitHub API authentication.
3. Custom runners: Many jobs use a custom runner `blacksmith-2vcpu-ubuntu-2204`.
4. Concurrency settings: Used to manage multiple workflow runs and conserve resources.
5. Spectral configuration in `rules.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   extends:
     - spectral:oas,recommended
   rules:
     paths-kebab-case: false
   ```

These configurations ensure secure authentication, efficient resource usage, proper execution environments for the workflows, and consistent API design practices.
