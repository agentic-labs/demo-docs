## High-level description
The `.github` directory contains configuration files and workflows for GitHub-specific features and automation. It includes issue templates, pull request templates, custom linting rules, and GitHub Actions workflows that automate various processes such as testing, building, and deploying different components of the project.

## What does it do?
This directory serves several important functions:

1. Standardizes issue reporting with a template that prompts users for a description, affected targets, and requirements to close the issue.
2. Provides a template for pull requests to ensure they reference related issues and mention relevant maintainers.
3. Defines custom linting rules for OpenAPI Specification (OAS) files, allowing for flexibility in path naming conventions.
4. Implements a comprehensive set of GitHub Actions workflows that automate:
   - Running tests and linting for frontend components (analytics, chat, dashboard, search) and the Rust backend.
   - Building and pushing Docker images for various system components.
   - Generating and validating OpenAPI specifications.
   - Ensuring code formatting and style consistency.
   - Creating specialized Docker images for tools like ClickHouse and clustering scripts.

These automations help maintain code quality, ensure consistent builds, and streamline the deployment process across the project.

## Key Files
1. `ISSUE_TEMPLATE/Issue Template`: Standardizes issue reporting with a structured format.
2. `pull_request_template.md`: Provides a template for pull requests to ensure they include necessary information.
3. `rules.yaml`: Configures custom linting rules for OpenAPI Specification files.
4. `workflows/`:
   - `rust-tests.yml`: Runs tests and linting for the Rust backend code.
   - `push-frontends.yml`: Builds and pushes Docker images for frontend components.
   - `push-server.yml`: Handles backend service Docker images.
   - Various `*-tests.yml` files: Run tests and linting for specific frontend components.
   - `push-clickhouse.yml` and `push-clustering-script.yml`: Build specialized Docker images.

## Dependencies
The workflows in this directory rely on several GitHub Actions and external tools:

1. `actions/checkout`: For checking out repository code.
2. `docker/setup-buildx-action`, `docker/login-action`, `docker/metadata-action`, `docker/build-push-action`: For Docker-related operations.
3. `ataylorme/eslint-annotate-action`: For annotating ESLint results.
4. `useblacksmith/cache`: For caching dependencies.
5. `clechasseur/rs-clippy-check`: For Rust code linting.
6. `@quobix/vacuum`: For OpenAPI specification linting and validation.

## Configuration
The directory uses various configuration options:

1. GitHub Secrets: `DOCKER_USERNAME` and `DOCKER_PASSWORD` for Docker Hub authentication.
2. Concurrency settings in workflows to prevent overlapping runs.
3. Trigger events for workflows, typically on pull requests, pushes to specific branches, or manual dispatch.
4. Custom runner specifications for many workflows.
5. The `rules.yaml` file configures custom linting rules, specifically disabling the `paths-kebab-case` rule for OAS files.

This `.github` directory plays a crucial role in standardizing development processes, maintaining code quality, and automating various aspects of the project's lifecycle on GitHub.
