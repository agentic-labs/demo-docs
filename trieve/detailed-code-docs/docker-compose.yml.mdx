## High-level description
This Docker Compose file defines a multi-service application stack for Trieve, a complex system that includes databases, search engines, file processing, authentication, and various frontend applications. It orchestrates multiple interconnected services to create a complete environment for running the Trieve application.

## Code Structure
The file defines multiple services, networks, and volumes. Each service is configured with specific images, environment variables, ports, volumes, and dependencies. The services are interconnected through a shared network and use various volumes for data persistence.
