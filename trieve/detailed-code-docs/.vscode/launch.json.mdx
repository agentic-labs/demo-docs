title: "launch.json"
---

## High-level description
This `launch.json` file configures Visual Studio Code's debugging settings for the Trieve project. It defines multiple debug configurations for different executables and test scenarios, allowing developers to easily launch and debug various components of the project directly from VS Code.

## Code Structure
The file contains a single JSON object with a "configurations" array, where each element represents a different debug configuration for various parts of the Trieve project.

## Symbols

### Configuration 1: Debug executable 'trieve-server'
#### Description
This configuration sets up debugging for the main 'trieve-server' executable.

#### Internal Logic
- Uses LLDB debugger
- Builds the project using Cargo with nightly Rust
- Specifies the manifest path and target binary
- Sets the working directory to the server folder

### Configuration 2: Debug executable 'ingestion-worker'
#### Description
This configuration sets up debugging for the 'ingestion-worker' executable.

#### Internal Logic
- Uses LLDB debugger
- Builds the project using Cargo
- Specifies the manifest path and target binary
- Sets the working directory to the server folder

### Configuration 3: Debug executable 'file-worker'
#### Description
This configuration sets up debugging for the 'file-worker' executable.

#### Internal Logic
- Uses LLDB debugger
- Builds the project using Cargo
- Specifies the manifest path and target binary
- Sets the working directory to the server folder

### Configuration 4: Debug unit tests in executable 'trieve-server'
#### Description
This configuration sets up debugging for unit tests in the 'trieve-server' executable.

#### Internal Logic
- Uses LLDB debugger
- Runs Cargo test command without actually running the tests (--no-run flag)
- Specifies the manifest path and target binary
- Sets the working directory to the server folder

## Dependencies
The configurations in this file depend on the following tools and environments:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| LLDB | Debugger used for all configurations |
| Cargo | Rust's package manager and build tool |
| Rust (nightly) | Used specifically for the 'trieve-server' configuration |

## Configuration
The file itself serves as a configuration for VS Code's debugging feature. Each configuration in the "configurations" array has the following common options:
| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| type | string | Specifies the debugger type (LLDB in all cases) |
| request | string | Specifies the request type (launch in all cases) |
| name | string | A descriptive name for the debug configuration |
| cargo | object | Specifies Cargo-related settings for building the project |
| args | array | Command-line arguments to pass to the executable (empty in all cases) |
| cwd | string | Sets the working directory for the debug session |

The `cargo` object within each configuration can have the following options:
| Option | Type | Description |
| args | array | Cargo command arguments |
| filter | object | Specifies which binary to debug (when applicable) |
