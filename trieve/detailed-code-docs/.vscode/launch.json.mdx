title: "launch.json"
---

## High-level description
This file, `.vscode/launch.json`, defines different debug configurations for a Rust project within the Visual Studio Code editor. It specifies how to build and launch various components of the project, including the main server ('trieve-server'), worker processes ('ingestion-worker', 'file-worker'), and unit tests.

## Code Structure
The code is structured as a JSON object with a single top-level key, `"configurations"`, which holds an array of debug configuration objects. Each configuration object defines settings for debugging a specific target within the project.

## Symbols
### `configurations`
#### Description
An array of debug configuration objects. Each object defines settings for debugging a specific target within the project.

#### Internal Logic
Each configuration object within the `"configurations"` array typically includes the following fields:

* `"type"`: Specifies the debugger type, in this case, `"lldb"` for the LLDB debugger.
* `"request"`:  Indicates the debugging mode, here set to `"launch"` for starting a new instance of the program.
* `"name"`: Provides a human-readable name for the configuration, displayed in the VS Code debugging interface.
* `"cargo"`: Contains instructions for Cargo, the Rust build system, on how to build the target executable.
    * `"args"`: An array of arguments passed to Cargo. Common arguments include:
        * `"build"`: Instructs Cargo to build the project.
        * `"test"`: Instructs Cargo to build and run tests.
        * `"--manifest-path"`: Specifies the path to the `Cargo.toml` file.
        * `"--bin"`:  Indicates the binary target to build.
        * `"--package"`: Specifies the package to build.
    * `"filter"`: (Optional) Used to filter specific targets within a package.
* `"args"`: An array of arguments passed to the executable being debugged.
* `"cwd"`: Specifies the working directory for the debugging session.
