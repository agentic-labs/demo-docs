## High-level description
This `turbo.json` file is a configuration file for Turborepo, a high-performance build system for JavaScript and TypeScript monorepos. It defines various tasks and their dependencies, outputs, and caching behaviors for the project's build pipeline.

## Symbols

### `$schema`
#### Description
Specifies the JSON schema for the Turborepo configuration file.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| $schema | string | URL of the JSON schema |

### `ui`
#### Description
Defines the user interface type for Turborepo.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ui | string | Type of user interface (set to "tui" for Text User Interface) |

### `tasks`
#### Description
Defines the various tasks that can be run in the project, along with their configurations.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| tasks | object | Collection of task configurations |

### `build`
#### Description
Configures the build task for the project.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| outputs | array | Specifies the output directories for the build task |
| dependsOn | array | Lists the tasks that must be completed before this task can run |

### `lint`
#### Description
Configures the lint task for the project.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| cache | boolean | Determines whether the task results should be cached |
| dependsOn | array | Lists the tasks that must be completed before this task can run |

### `lint:CI`
#### Description
Configures a separate lint task for CI environments.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| cache | boolean | Determines whether the task results should be cached |
| dependsOn | array | Lists the tasks that must be completed before this task can run |

### `dev`
#### Description
Configures the development task for the project.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| persistent | boolean | Indicates whether the task should run continuously |
| cache | boolean | Determines whether the task results should be cached |
| dependsOn | array | Lists the tasks that must be completed before this task can run |

### `trieve-ts-sdk#build`
#### Description
Configures a specific build task for the `trieve-ts-sdk` package.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| outputs | array | Specifies the output directories for this specific build task |

## Dependencies
This configuration file doesn't directly use external libraries, but it defines dependencies between tasks within the project.

## Configuration
The entire file serves as a configuration for Turborepo. Key configurations include:

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| ui | string | "tui" | Sets the user interface type to Text User Interface |
| build.outputs | array | ["dist/**"] | Specifies the output directory for build tasks |
| lint.cache | boolean | false | Disables caching for lint tasks |
| dev.persistent | boolean | true | Makes the dev task run continuously |
| dev.cache | boolean | false | Disables caching for the dev task |

## Performance Considerations
- The `build` task specifies outputs, which allows Turborepo to cache the results and potentially skip unnecessary rebuilds.
- Linting tasks (`lint` and `lint:CI`) have caching disabled, ensuring they always run.
- The `dev` task is set to be persistent and not cached, suitable for continuous development work.
- Task dependencies are clearly defined, allowing Turborepo to optimize the execution order and parallelization of tasks.
