## High-level description
This `turbo.json` file is a configuration file for Turborepo, a high-performance build system for JavaScript and TypeScript monorepos. It defines various tasks and their dependencies, outputs, and caching behaviors for the project's build pipeline.

## Symbols

### Root Configuration
#### Description
The root configuration object defines the overall structure and settings for the Turborepo build system.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| $schema | string | The JSON schema URL for Turborepo configuration |
| ui | string | Specifies the user interface type, set to "tui" (Text User Interface) |
| tasks | object | Defines the various tasks and their configurations |

### Tasks
#### Description
The `tasks` object defines different build and development tasks along with their configurations.

#### Internal Logic
Each task is defined as a key-value pair, where the key is the task name and the value is an object containing task-specific configurations.

### build
#### Description
Defines the build task configuration.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| outputs | array | Specifies the output directory for build artifacts |

#### Internal Logic
- Outputs are set to `"dist/**"`, indicating that all files and subdirectories in the `dist` directory are considered outputs.
- Depends on the build tasks of all dependencies (specified by `"^build"`).

### lint
#### Description
Defines the lint task configuration.

#### Internal Logic
- Caching is disabled for this task.
- Depends on the build tasks of all dependencies.

### lint:CI
#### Description
Defines a separate lint task for CI environments.

#### Internal Logic
- Identical configuration to the `lint` task.
- Caching is disabled.
- Depends on the build tasks of all dependencies.

### dev
#### Description
Defines the development task configuration.

#### Internal Logic
- Set as a persistent task, meaning it runs continuously.
- Caching is disabled.
- Depends specifically on the build task of the `trieve-fetch-client` package.

### trieve-fetch-client#build
#### Description
Defines a specific build task for the `trieve-fetch-client` package.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| outputs | array | Specifies the output directory for build artifacts |

#### Internal Logic
- Outputs are set to `"dist"`, indicating that the `dist` directory is considered the output.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Turborepo | Build system for managing monorepo tasks and dependencies |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| $schema | string | "https://turbo.build/schema.json" | Specifies the JSON schema for Turborepo configuration |
| ui | string | "tui" | Sets the user interface type to Text User Interface |

This configuration file sets up a structured build pipeline for a monorepo project, defining various tasks such as building, linting, and development. It specifies dependencies between tasks, output directories, and caching behaviors to optimize the build process.
