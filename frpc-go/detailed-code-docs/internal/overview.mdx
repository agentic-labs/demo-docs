## High-level description
This code defines a package named `version` that embeds and exposes the current version of the software. It uses Go's embed feature to include the contents of a file named `current_version` into the `Version` variable at compile time.

### Version
#### Description
`Version` is a string variable that holds the current version of the software. Its value is embedded from the `current_version` file at compile time using Go's embed directive.

#### Inputs
This variable doesn't have inputs as it's populated at compile time.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Version | string | The current version of the software, as specified in the `current_version` file |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| embed | Used to embed the contents of the `current_version` file into the `Version` variable |

## Notes
1. The package uses the `//go:embed` directive, which is a feature introduced in Go 1.16. This allows the contents of the `current_version` file to be embedded into the binary at compile time.
2. The `_ "embed"` import is a blank import, which is necessary to use the `//go:embed` directive even though the package is not explicitly used in the code.
3. The embedded file is named `current_version` and should be located in the same directory as this Go file.
4. This approach allows for easy version management, as updating the version only requires changing the `current_version` file, not modifying the Go code itself.
5. The package includes an Apache 2.0 license header, indicating the terms under which the code is distributed.

This simple yet effective setup provides a centralized way to manage and access the software version across the entire application.
