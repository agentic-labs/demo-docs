## High-level description
This directory contains GitHub Actions workflow files that define automated processes for continuous integration and code quality assurance for a Go project. The workflows are designed to run linting checks and automated tests, including race condition detection, on pull requests and push events.

## What does it do?
The workflows in this directory automate two critical aspects of the development process:

1. Code Quality Checks: The "Lint" workflow runs on pull requests, using golangci-lint to perform static code analysis on the Go codebase. This helps maintain code consistency and catch potential issues early in the development cycle.

2. Automated Testing: The "Tests" workflow runs on both push events and pull requests. It executes two types of tests:
   - Standard tests: Run the project's test suite to ensure functionality.
   - Race condition tests: Run tests with race detection enabled to identify potential concurrency issues.

These automated processes help ensure that code changes maintain quality standards and don't introduce regressions before being merged into the main codebase.

## Key Files

### lint.yml
This file defines the "Lint" workflow. Key features include:
- Triggered on pull requests
- Uses golangci-lint for Go code linting
- Runs on the latest Ubuntu environment
- Sets up Go 1.21 without caching
- Uses the latest version of golangci-lint

### tests.yaml
This file defines the "Tests" workflow. Key features include:
- Triggered on push and pull request events for all branches
- Defines two jobs: `tests` and `tests-race`
- Both jobs set up Go 1.21, cache dependencies, and install Protoc and related plugins
- The `tests` job runs standard tests using `go test -v ./...`
- The `tests-race` job runs tests with race detection using `go test -race -v ./...`
- Includes a 15-minute timeout for the `tests-race` job

## Dependencies
Both workflows rely on several GitHub Actions:

1. actions/checkout (v2 and v3): Used to fetch the repository code.
2. actions/setup-go (v2 and v4): Sets up the Go programming environment.
3. actions/cache (v2): Caches Go build and mod dependencies for improved performance.
4. golangci/golangci-lint-action (v3): Runs golangci-lint for code linting.
5. arduino/setup-protoc (v1): Installs Protoc for handling protocol buffers.

## Configuration
The workflows use the following key configurations:

1. Go version: Both workflows use Go 1.21.
2. golangci-lint version: The lint workflow uses the latest version.
3. Caching: The test workflow caches Go build and mod dependencies, while the lint workflow disables caching for Go setup.
4. Test execution: Standard tests and race condition tests are run separately.
5. Protoc setup: The test workflow installs Protoc and related plugins, including a custom `frpc` plugin.

## Additional Notes
1. There's an inconsistency in the checkout action versions used (v2 and v3). Standardizing to v3 could improve consistency.
2. The `go-cache-paths` step in the test workflow uses a deprecated `set-output` command, which should be updated to use the `$GITHUB_OUTPUT` environment file.
3. The installation of the custom `frpc` plugin for `protoc-gen` might benefit from an additional verification step.

These workflows collectively ensure that code changes are thoroughly checked for quality and functionality before being integrated into the main codebase, supporting a robust continuous integration process for the Go project.
