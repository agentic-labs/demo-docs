## High-level description
This YAML file defines a GitHub Actions workflow named "Lint" that runs on pull requests. Its primary purpose is to perform linting on Go code using golangci-lint, ensuring code quality and consistency in the project.

### Workflow: Lint
#### Description
This workflow is triggered on pull requests and consists of a single job named "golang" that runs on the latest Ubuntu environment.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks out the repository code
2. Sets up the Go programming environment
3. Runs golangci-lint to perform linting on the Go code

### Job: golang
#### Description
This job defines the steps to set up the Go environment and run the linting process.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checkout: Uses actions/checkout@v3 to fetch the repository code
2. Set up Golang: Uses actions/setup-go@v4 to install Go version 1.21 without caching
3. golangci-lint: Uses golangci/golangci-lint-action@v3 to run the latest version of golangci-lint

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| actions/checkout@v3 | To check out the repository code |
| actions/setup-go@v4 | To set up the Go programming environment |
| golangci/golangci-lint-action@v3 | To run golangci-lint for linting Go code |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| go-version | string | '1.21' | Specifies the version of Go to be installed |
| cache | boolean | false | Disables caching for Go setup |
| version | string | latest | Specifies the version of golangci-lint to use |

This workflow is designed to run automatically on pull requests, helping maintain code quality by performing linting checks on Go code before it's merged into the main codebase.
