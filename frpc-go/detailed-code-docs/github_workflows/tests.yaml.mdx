title: "tests.yaml"

## High-level description
This YAML file defines a GitHub Actions workflow named "Tests" that runs automated tests for a Go project. It sets up two jobs: one for running standard tests and another for running tests with race condition detection. The workflow is triggered on push and pull request events for all branches.

## Code Structure
The workflow consists of two main jobs: `tests` and `tests-race`. Both jobs have similar steps but differ in their final test execution command. They set up the Go environment, cache dependencies, install necessary tools, and run tests.

## Symbols

### `tests` (job)
#### Description
This job runs the standard tests for the project.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up the Go environment and caches dependencies.
2. Installs Protoc and related plugins.
3. Runs the generator for test proto files.
4. Executes the tests using `go test -v ./...`.

### `tests-race` (job)
#### Description
This job runs tests with race condition detection enabled.

#### Internal Logic
Similar to the `tests` job, but the final step runs tests with the `-race` flag:
`go test -race -v ./...`

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| actions/checkout@v2 | Checks out the repository |
| actions/setup-go@v2 | Sets up the Go environment |
| actions/cache@v2 | Caches Go build and mod dependencies |
| arduino/setup-protoc@v1 | Installs Protoc |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| go-version | string | '1.21' | Specifies the Go version to use |

## Performance Considerations
The workflow uses caching for Go build and mod dependencies to improve performance across runs. The `tests-race` job has a timeout of 15 minutes due to the potential for longer execution times when running with race detection.

## TODOs
- The workflow uses both `actions/checkout@v2` and `actions/checkout@v3`. It might be beneficial to standardize on the latest version (v3) for consistency.
- Consider adding a step to verify the installation of the custom `frpc` plugin for `protoc-gen`.
- The `go-cache-paths` step uses the deprecated `set-output` command. It should be updated to use the newer `$GITHUB_OUTPUT` environment file.
