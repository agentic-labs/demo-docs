## High-level description
This code defines a function `getServerFields` that generates a string representation of server fields based on the provided protobuf service descriptors. It's part of a code generator package for creating server-side code from protobuf definitions.

## Symbols

### `getServerFields`
#### Description
This function takes a `protoreflect.ServiceDescriptors` as input and generates a comma-separated string of server fields. Each field is named after the service, with the first letter lowercased, followed by the service name in CamelCase.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| services | protoreflect.ServiceDescriptors | A collection of service descriptors from the protobuf definition |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| serverFields | string | A comma-separated string of server fields |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initialize a `strings.Builder`.
2. Iterate through all services in the input `ServiceDescriptors`.
3. For each service:
   - Get the service name and convert it to CamelCase.
   - Write the field name (service name with first letter lowercased) to the builder.
   - Write the service name in CamelCase to the builder.
   - Add a comma and space separator.
4. Remove the trailing comma and space from the final string.
5. Return the resulting string.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| strings | Used for string manipulation and building |
| github.com/loopholelabs/polyglot/v2/utils | Provides utility functions for string case conversion |
| google.golang.org/protobuf/reflect/protoreflect | Provides types for working with protobuf descriptors |

## References
This function is likely used in conjunction with other parts of the code generator, particularly in template rendering. The `getServerFields` function is referenced in the `template.FuncMap` in the `init` function of the related `generator.go` file.

## Notes
- The function assumes that the service names in the protobuf definition are valid and can be converted to CamelCase without issues.
- The resulting string is intended to be used in generated Go code, likely as part of a struct definition or function parameter list.
- The function is designed to work with the protobuf reflection API, making it flexible for use with various protobuf definitions.
