## High-level description
This file defines a set of import statements used in the code generation process for the frpc-go project. It contains predefined slices of import strings for different components of the generated code, such as required imports, service imports, stream method imports, and method imports.

## Symbols

### `requiredImports`
#### Description
A slice of strings containing the import paths for packages that are required in all generated code.

#### Inputs
None (it's a variable declaration)

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| requiredImports | []string | A slice of import paths |

### `serviceImports`
#### Description
A slice of strings containing the import paths for packages that are used in service-related code generation.

#### Inputs
None (it's a variable declaration)

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| serviceImports | []string | A slice of import paths |

### `streamMethodImports`
#### Description
A slice of strings containing the import paths for packages that are used in stream method-related code generation.

#### Inputs
None (it's a variable declaration)

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| streamMethodImports | []string | A slice of import paths |

### `methodImports`
#### Description
A slice of strings containing the import paths for packages that are used in method-related code generation.

#### Inputs
None (it's a variable declaration)

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| methodImports | []string | A slice of import paths |

## Dependencies
This file doesn't directly use any external libraries, but it defines import paths for various dependencies that will be used in the generated code:

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| errors | Standard Go error handling |
| github.com/loopholelabs/polyglot/v2 | Polyglot library for code generation |
| net | Networking functionality |
| context | Context handling in Go |
| crypto/tls | TLS functionality |
| github.com/loopholelabs/frisbee-go | Frisbee Go library |
| github.com/loopholelabs/frisbee-go/pkg/packet | Packet handling in Frisbee |
| github.com/rs/zerolog | Zerolog logging library |
| go.uber.org/atomic | Atomic operations from Uber's library |
| io | I/O functionality |
| sync | Synchronization primitives |

These import statements are used by the code generator to include necessary dependencies in the generated Go code for the frpc-go project.
