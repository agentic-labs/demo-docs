## High-level description

This code is a generated fRPC (Frisbee RPC) implementation based on a protocol buffer definition. It provides server and client implementations for an RPC service called "EchoService" with various methods, including streaming and non-streaming operations. The code uses the Frisbee framework for network communication and Polyglot for serialization.

## Code Structure

The code defines several message types (Request, Response, Data, etc.) and their corresponding serialization/deserialization methods. It also implements server and client structures for the EchoService, including handlers for different RPC methods. The server and client implementations use the Frisbee framework for managing connections and packet handling.

## Symbols

### `NewServer`
#### Description
Creates a new fRPC server instance for the EchoService.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| echoService | EchoService | Implementation of the EchoService interface |
| tlsConfig | *tls.Config | TLS configuration (optional) |
| logger | *zerolog.Logger | Logger instance (optional) |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| *Server | *Server | Pointer to the created Server instance |
| error | error | Error, if any occurred during server creation |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a handler table for RPC methods
2. Initializes a Frisbee server with the handler table and optional TLS/logger
3. Sets up stream handlers for streaming RPC methods
4. Configures connection context and closure handling

### `NewClient`
#### Description
Creates a new fRPC client instance for the EchoService.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| tlsConfig | *tls.Config | TLS configuration (optional) |
| logger | *zerolog.Logger | Logger instance (optional) |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| *Client | *Client | Pointer to the created Client instance |
| error | error | Error, if any occurred during client creation |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a handler table for RPC responses
2. Initializes a Frisbee client with the handler table and optional TLS/logger
3. Sets up client-side structures for managing RPC calls and responses

### `Request`, `Response`, `Data`, etc.
#### Description
Message types used in the RPC service, with methods for encoding and decoding.

#### Internal Logic
Each message type implements:
- `Encode`: Serializes the message to a Polyglot buffer
- `Decode`: Deserializes the message from a byte slice
- `decode`: Internal method for deserialization from a Polyglot buffer decoder

### `EchoStreamServer`, `SearchServer`, `UploadServer`
#### Description
Server-side handlers for streaming RPC methods.

#### Internal Logic
- Manage bidirectional communication for streaming methods
- Handle receiving and sending of messages
- Implement logic for closing streams and handling errors

### `EchoStreamClient`, `SearchClient`, `UploadClient`
#### Description
Client-side handlers for streaming RPC methods.

#### Internal Logic
- Manage bidirectional communication for streaming methods
- Provide methods for sending, receiving, and closing streams

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| github.com/loopholelabs/polyglot/v2 | Serialization and deserialization |
| github.com/loopholelabs/frisbee-go | Network communication framework |
| github.com/rs/zerolog | Logging |
| go.uber.org/atomic | Atomic operations for concurrency |

## Error Handling
The code implements error handling throughout, including:
- Checking for nil pointers before operations
- Propagating errors from encoding/decoding operations
- Handling network-related errors in server and client operations

## Logging
Logging is supported through the optional `*zerolog.Logger` parameter in `NewServer` and `NewClient`.

## API/Interface Reference
The main interfaces exposed are:
- `EchoService`: Defines the RPC methods to be implemented by the server
- `Server`: Represents the fRPC server
- `Client`: Represents the fRPC client

Each RPC method has corresponding client and server-side implementations for handling the communication.
