## High-level description
The `pkg/generator` directory contains the core components for generating fRPC (Frisbee RPC) code from Protocol Buffer (protobuf) definitions. It includes a Generator struct and associated methods for parsing protobuf files and generating corresponding Go code using custom templates and the Polyglot library.

## What does it do?
This package is responsible for:

1. Parsing Protocol Buffer definitions and generating corresponding fRPC Go code.
2. Handling code generation requests and responses.
3. Applying custom templates for encoding, decoding, and custom fields.
4. Generating server-side code, including service implementations and method handlers.
5. Managing imports for the generated code.
6. Providing utility functions for file naming and string manipulation.
7. Implementing comprehensive tests for various RPC patterns (synchronous, bi-directional streaming, server streaming, and client streaming).

The workflow typically involves:
1. Receiving a code generation request containing protobuf definitions.
2. Parsing the request and extracting relevant information about services and methods.
3. Applying custom templates to generate Go code for fRPC implementation.
4. Handling different RPC patterns and generating appropriate server and client code.
5. Managing imports and file naming for the generated code.
6. Returning a code generation response with the generated files.

## Key Files

1. generator.go:
   - Defines the `Generator` struct and its methods for code generation.
   - Implements the main `Generate` method that processes protobuf files and generates fRPC code.
   - Handles template execution and custom function mapping for code generation.

2. headers.go:
   - Provides utility functions for generating file names with the ".frpc.go" extension.

3. imports.go:
   - Defines sets of import statements used in the code generation process.
   - Contains predefined slices of import strings for different components of the generated code.

4. server.go:
   - Implements the `getServerFields` function for generating server field strings based on protobuf service descriptors.

5. test/generator_test.go:
   - Contains comprehensive tests for the RPC system, covering various communication patterns.
   - Sets up client-server environments for testing different RPC scenarios.

6. test/server.go:
   - Implements a test server (svc struct) that handles various RPC methods for testing purposes.

7. test/test.frpc.go:
   - Generated code for the fRPC implementation used in testing.
   - Defines message types, serialization/deserialization methods, and client/server structures.

## Dependencies
The package relies on several external libraries and frameworks:

1. github.com/loopholelabs/polyglot/v2: Used for Go code generation and utility functions.
2. google.golang.org/protobuf: Provides protobuf compilation, reflection, and plugin support.
3. github.com/loopholelabs/frpc-go: Contains internal version information and custom templates.
4. github.com/loopholelabs/frisbee-go: The underlying network communication framework for the RPC system.
5. github.com/rs/zerolog: Used for logging in the generated code.
6. go.uber.org/atomic: Provides atomic operations for handling concurrency.
7. github.com/stretchr/testify: Used for test assertions in the test suite.

These dependencies were chosen to provide efficient protobuf parsing, code generation, network communication, and testing capabilities for the fRPC system.

## Configuration
The code uses a `template.FuncMap` to configure custom functions for use in templates:

- CamelCase: Converts strings to CamelCase.
- MakeIterable: Creates an iterable slice from an int.
- Counter: Creates a counter function starting from a given number.
- FirstLowerCase: Converts the first character of a string to lowercase.
- GetServerFields: Generates server fields from service descriptors.
- UsedForStreaming: Checks if a type is used for streaming.

These functions are used in the code generation process to manipulate strings, generate appropriate field names, and handle various aspects of the fRPC code structure.

The generator also uses predefined import slices (requiredImports, serviceImports, streamMethodImports, methodImports) to manage imports in the generated code, ensuring that all necessary dependencies are included.
