### Configuration Options
#### Description
The file contains a series of configuration options for markdownlint. Each option is set to either `true` or `false`, determining whether a specific rule is enabled or disabled.

#### Internal Logic
The configuration is designed to disable most formatting-related rules while keeping the default behavior for content-related rules. This approach allows for more flexibility in formatting, which can be beneficial when using autoformatters or when working with various Markdown styles.

Here's a breakdown of the configuration:

1. `default: true`: This enables all rules by default.
2. The following rules are then explicitly disabled (set to `false`):
   - `blank_lines`: Rules related to blank line formatting
   - `bullet`: Rules for bullet point formatting
   - `html`: Rules for HTML usage in Markdown
   - `indentation`: Rules for indentation
   - `line_length`: Rules limiting line length
   - `spaces`: Rules for space usage
   - `url`: Rules for URL formatting
   - `whitespace`: Rules for whitespace usage
   - `first-line-h1`: Rule requiring the first line to be a top-level heading
   - `no-trailing-punctuation`: Rule prohibiting trailing punctuation in headings
   - `no-duplicate-header`: Rule preventing duplicate headers

## Dependencies
This configuration file is intended to be used with markdownlint, a linting tool for Markdown files.
