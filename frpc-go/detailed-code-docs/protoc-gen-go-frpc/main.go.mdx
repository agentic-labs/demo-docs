## High-level description
This code implements a Protocol Buffers (protobuf) plugin for generating Go code with fRPC (Fast Remote Procedure Call) functionality. It reads protobuf definitions from standard input, generates corresponding Go code using the fRPC generator, and writes the result to standard output.

## Code Structure
The main function orchestrates the entire process by creating a generator instance, reading input, generating code, and writing output. It utilizes the `generator` package from the `github.com/loopholelabs/frpc-go/pkg/generator` module to perform the actual code generation.

## Symbols

### `main`
#### Description
The `main` function is the entry point of the program. It performs the following steps:
1. Creates a new generator instance
2. Reads protobuf definitions from standard input
3. Unmarshals the input into a request object
4. Generates Go code based on the request
5. Marshals the generated code into a response
6. Writes the response to standard output

#### Internal Logic
1. Create a new generator instance using `generator.New()`
2. Read all data from standard input using `io.ReadAll(os.Stdin)`
3. Unmarshal the input data into a request object using `gen.UnmarshalRequest(data)`
4. Generate Go code based on the request using `gen.Generate(req)`
5. Marshal the generated code into a response using `gen.MarshalResponse(res)`
6. Write the response data to standard output using `os.Stdout.Write(data)`

#### Error Handling
The code uses `panic()` to handle errors, which is not ideal for production use but simplifies error handling in this context. Errors are checked after each major operation (reading input, unmarshaling, generating, marshaling, and writing output).

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| io | Used for reading all data from standard input |
| os | Used for accessing standard input and output |
| github.com/loopholelabs/frpc-go/pkg/generator | Provides the code generation functionality |

## Notes
1. The code is part of a larger project that includes a GitHub Actions workflow for testing and a package defining required imports for the generated code.
2. The generator likely produces Go code that implements fRPC functionality based on the protobuf definitions provided as input.
3. The use of `panic()` for error handling suggests that this is a command-line tool where abrupt termination with an error message is acceptable.
