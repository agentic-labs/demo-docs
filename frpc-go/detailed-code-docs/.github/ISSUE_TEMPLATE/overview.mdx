## High-level description
This directory contains GitHub issue templates for the repository. These templates are designed to standardize and streamline the process of creating issues, ensuring that users provide necessary information when reporting bugs, requesting features, or submitting other types of issues.

## What does it do?
The issue templates in this directory guide users through the process of creating different types of issues in the repository. They provide structured formats for bug reports, feature requests, and other general issues. Additionally, the configuration file customizes the GitHub Issues experience by disabling blank issues and directing users to external support channels when appropriate.

## Key Files
1. `bug_report.md`: This template is used for reporting bugs. It prompts users to describe the bug, provide steps to reproduce it, explain the expected behavior, and add any additional context.

2. `feature_request.md`: This template is for suggesting new features or improvements. It asks users to describe the problem their feature request is related to, explain their proposed solution, mention any alternatives they've considered, and provide additional context.

3. `other.md`: This template is for issues that don't fit into the bug report or feature request categories. It provides a more general structure for describing the issue and adding context.

4. `config.yml`: This configuration file customizes the GitHub Issues experience. It disables blank issues and provides a link to the Loophole Labs community support channel on Discord for asking and answering questions.

## Configuration
The `config.yml` file contains the following configuration:

```yaml
blank_issues_enabled: false
contact_links:
  - name: Loophole Labs Community Support
    url: https://discord.gg/loopholelabs
    about: Please ask and answer questions here.
```

This configuration:
- Disables the creation of blank issues (`blank_issues_enabled: false`)
- Provides a link to the Loophole Labs Discord server for community support

The issue templates use YAML front matter to specify metadata:

```yaml
---
name: Bug report
about: Create a report to help us improve
title: ""
labels: bug
assignees: ShivanshVij
---
```

This metadata:
- Sets the name of the template
- Provides a description of its purpose
- Sets a default title (empty in this case)
- Applies the "bug" label automatically
- Assigns the issue to ShivanshVij

Similar metadata is used for the feature request and other issue templates, with appropriate adjustments to the labels and descriptions.

By using these templates and configuration, the project maintainers can ensure that issues are well-structured, contain necessary information, and are properly categorized and assigned from the start. This helps in managing the project more efficiently and provides a better experience for both users reporting issues and developers addressing them.
