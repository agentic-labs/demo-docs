## High-level description
This code defines a Go template for generating import statements in a Go file. It's designed to handle different types of imports based on the context of the generated code, such as required imports, service imports, method imports, and stream method imports.

## Code Structure
The template is structured as a single block named "imports" that generates a Go import statement. It uses conditional logic to include different sets of imports based on the presence of certain elements in the code being generated.

## Symbols

### `imports` (Template)
#### Description
This is the main template block that generates the import statements for a Go file.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| .requiredImports | []string | A slice of strings representing the required import paths |
| .numServices | int | The number of services in the generated code |
| .serviceImports | []string | A slice of strings representing import paths for services |
| .numMethods | int | The number of methods in the generated code |
| .methodImports | []string | A slice of strings representing import paths for methods |
| .numStreamMethods | int | The number of streaming methods in the generated code |
| .streamMethodImports | []string | A slice of strings representing import paths for streaming methods |

#### Outputs
The template generates a Go `import` block containing the specified import statements.

#### Internal Logic
1. The template starts by opening an `import` block.
2. It first iterates over `.requiredImports`, adding each import path.
3. If `.numServices` is non-zero, it iterates over `.serviceImports`, adding each import path.
4. If `.numMethods` is non-zero, it iterates over `.methodImports`, adding each import path.
5. If `.numStreamMethods` is non-zero, it iterates over `.streamMethodImports`, adding each import path.
6. Finally, it closes the `import` block.

## Performance Considerations
This template uses range loops to iterate over the import slices, which is efficient for generating the import statements. The conditional checks (e.g., `{{ if .numServices }}`) ensure that only relevant import sections are included, potentially reducing the size of the generated code.
