title: "templates.go"
---

## High-level description
This code defines an embedded filesystem containing templates for code generation. It's part of a package named "templates" and uses Go's `embed` package to include all files in the current directory into the compiled binary.

## Symbols

### FS
#### Description
`FS` is a variable of type `embed.FS` (embedded filesystem) that contains all files in the current directory and its subdirectories.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| FS | embed.FS | An embedded filesystem containing all files in the current directory |

#### Internal Logic
The `//go:embed *` directive tells the Go compiler to embed all files from the current directory into the `FS` variable.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| embed | Provides functionality to embed files into the Go binary at compile time |

## References
This embedded filesystem is used in the `generator` package (as seen in the related code snippet) to access templates for code generation. Specifically, it's used in the `init()` function of the generator to parse templates:

```go
templ = template.Must(template.New("main").Funcs(template.FuncMap{
    // ...
}).ParseFS(templates.FS, "*"))
```

This allows the generator to access the templates without needing to read them from the filesystem at runtime, making the resulting binary more self-contained and portable.
