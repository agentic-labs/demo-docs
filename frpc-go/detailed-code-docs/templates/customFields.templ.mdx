## High-level description
This file appears to be a Go template file (`customFields.templ`) that defines custom fields for error handling and flags. It contains two declarations: `error` and `flags`, which are likely used for error management and flag-based configurations in a larger system.

## Symbols

### `error`
#### Description
This symbol is declared as an `error` type. In Go, `error` is a built-in interface type used for error handling.

#### Inputs
N/A (This is a type declaration, not a function)

#### Outputs
N/A (This is a type declaration, not a function)

### `flags`
#### Description
This symbol is declared as a `uint8` type. In Go, `uint8` is an unsigned 8-bit integer, which can represent values from 0 to 255.

#### Inputs
N/A (This is a type declaration, not a function)

#### Outputs
N/A (This is a type declaration, not a function)

## Side Effects
The declarations themselves do not have side effects. However, the usage of these types in the broader context of the application may influence error handling and configuration behavior.

## Dependencies
No external dependencies are directly visible in this file.

## Error Handling
The `error` declaration suggests that this template is part of an error handling mechanism in the larger application. However, the specific implementation details are not visible in this snippet.

## Configuration
The `flags` declaration of type `uint8` implies that it might be used for configuration or state management, possibly representing up to 8 boolean flags in a single byte.

The provided documentation focuses on the observable declarations and their potential uses in a broader context.
