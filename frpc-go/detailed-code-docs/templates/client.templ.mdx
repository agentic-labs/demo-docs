## High-level description
This code defines a client-side implementation for an RPC (Remote Procedure Call) system using the Frisbee protocol. It generates client structs and methods for various services defined in a protocol buffer-like schema, handling both unary and streaming RPC calls.

## Code Structure
The code is structured as a Go template that generates client-side code for multiple services. It defines structures for each service client, a main Client struct, and methods for creating and using these clients. The code also includes helper functions for handling different types of RPC calls (unary and streaming).

## Symbols

### `Client`
#### Description
The main client struct that encapsulates all service-specific clients.

#### Internal Logic
- Initializes service-specific clients
- Provides methods for connecting to a server and creating a client from an existing connection

### `NewClient`
#### Description
Creates and initializes a new Client instance.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| tlsConfig | *tls.Config | TLS configuration for secure connections |
| logger | *zerolog.Logger | Logger for client operations |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| *Client | *Client | Initialized Client instance |
| error | error | Error if initialization fails |

#### Internal Logic
- Creates a new frisbee.Client with the provided TLS config and logger
- Initializes service-specific clients and their internal state (e.g., mutexes, maps for inflight requests)

### `Connect`
#### Description
Connects the client to a server at the specified address.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| addr | string | Server address to connect to |
| streamHandler | ...frisbee.NewStreamHandler | Optional stream handlers |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| error | error | Error if connection fails |

### `FromConn`
#### Description
Creates a client from an existing network connection.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| conn | net.Conn | Existing network connection |
| streamHandler | ...frisbee.NewStreamHandler | Optional stream handlers |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| error | error | Error if client creation fails |

### Service-specific client methods
#### Description
For each service method defined in the schema, the template generates corresponding client methods.

#### Internal Logic
- For unary calls: Prepares the request, sends it, and waits for the response
- For streaming calls: Creates a new stream and returns a stream client for further interaction

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| github.com/loopholelabs/frisbee-go | Underlying RPC framework |
| github.com/rs/zerolog | Logging |
| crypto/tls | TLS support for secure connections |
| sync | Synchronization primitives |
| go.uber.org/atomic | Atomic operations |

## Error Handling
The code uses a combination of error returns and a custom `CloseError` type for handling errors in RPC operations.

## Performance Considerations
- Uses sync.RWMutex for thread-safe access to shared resources
- Implements connection pooling and reuse through the frisbee.Client

This template generates a comprehensive client-side implementation for an RPC system, handling various types of RPC calls and providing a clean API for service interactions.
