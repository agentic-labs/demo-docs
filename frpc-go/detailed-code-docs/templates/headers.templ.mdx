title: "headers.templ"
---

## High-level description
This code defines a Go template for generating headers in fRPC (fast Remote Procedure Call) Go files. It creates a standardized header comment that includes version information and the source file path, along with the package declaration.

## Symbols

### `headers`
#### Description
This is a named template that generates a standard header for fRPC Go generated files. It includes a warning comment, version information, source file path, and the package declaration.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| .pluginVersion | string | The version of the fRPC Go plugin used to generate the code |
| .sourcePath | string | The path of the source file from which the code is generated |
| .package | string | The name of the Go package for the generated code |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a string containing the generated header comment and package declaration.

#### Internal Logic
1. Outputs a comment indicating that the code is generated and should not be edited manually.
2. Includes the fRPC Go plugin version in the comment.
3. Specifies the source file path in the comment.
4. Declares the Go package for the generated code.

## Dependencies
This template likely depends on the Go text/template package for rendering, although it's not explicitly shown in the provided code snippet.

## Configuration
The template uses three configuration options passed as dot-notation variables:
| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| .pluginVersion | string | The version of the fRPC Go plugin |
| .sourcePath | string | The path of the source file |
| .package | string | The name of the Go package |

## Notes
- This template is designed to be used as part of a larger code generation system for fRPC Go.
- The use of the `{{define "headers"}}` syntax suggests that this template might be included or used within other templates.
- The generated comment helps developers understand that the file is auto-generated and should not be manually edited, which is a common practice in code generation tools.
