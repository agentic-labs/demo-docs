## High-level description

This file, `base.templ`, serves as a template for generating code related to gRPC services. It includes several sub-templates that define interfaces, constants, server, and client code. The template is structured to conditionally include server and client code based on the number of services present.

## Code Structure

The `base.templ` file is composed of four main sections:

1. Interfaces (always included)
2. Constants (always included)
3. Server code (conditionally included)
4. Client code (conditionally included)

The inclusion of server and client code depends on the presence of services, as indicated by the `.numServices` condition.

## Symbols

### Template: base

#### Description

This is the main template that orchestrates the inclusion of other sub-templates to generate the complete gRPC-related code.

#### Inputs

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| . | struct | The data context passed to the template |

#### Internal Logic

1. Always include the "interfaces" and "constants" templates.
2. Check if there are any services (`.numServices`).
3. If services exist, include the "server" and "client" templates.

## Dependencies

This template relies on several other templates that are not directly visible in this file:

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| interfaces | Defines interfaces for the gRPC services |
| constants | Defines constants used in the gRPC implementation |
| server | Generates server-side code for the gRPC services |
| client | Generates client-side code for the gRPC services |

## Configuration

The template uses a conditional statement to determine whether to include server and client code:

| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| .numServices | int | The number of gRPC services defined |

## Notes

1. The template uses the Go template syntax, as indicated by the `{{}}` delimiters.
2. The `.` before `numServices` suggests that the data is passed as a struct or map to the template.
3. The template is designed to be flexible, allowing for the generation of different parts of the gRPC code based on the presence of services.
4. The order of the templates (interfaces, constants, server, client) suggests a logical structure for the generated code, with shared definitions coming before the specific implementations.

This template serves as a central point for generating a complete gRPC codebase, ensuring that all necessary components are included and properly organized based on the service definitions provided.
