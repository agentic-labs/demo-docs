title: "interfaces.templ"
---

## High-level description
This code defines a template for generating interfaces in Go. It iterates through a collection of services and creates an interface for each service with its associated methods.

## Code Structure
The code consists of two main template definitions: "interfaces" and "interface". The "interfaces" template iterates through a collection of services, while the "interface" template defines the structure for each individual service interface.

## Symbols

### `interfaces`
#### Description
This template iterates through a collection of services and generates an interface for each service.

#### Internal Logic
1. It uses a range loop to iterate through the services.
2. For each service, it calls the "interface" template to generate the interface definition.

### `interface`
#### Description
This template defines the structure of a single service interface.

#### Internal Logic
1. It creates an interface with the name derived from the service name (CamelCased).
2. It iterates through the methods of the service.
3. For each method, it generates a method signature based on the method's properties:
   - If the method is streaming client, it uses a specific signature.
   - If the method is streaming server, it uses another specific signature.
   - For non-streaming methods, it uses a standard RPC-style signature.

## Dependencies
The code relies on several custom functions:
- `MakeIterable`: Likely used to create an iterable object from the services collection.
- `CamelCaseName`: Used to convert names to CamelCase.
- `CamelCase`: Similar to CamelCaseName, but possibly with different behavior.

These functions are not defined in the provided code snippet and are likely part of a larger template engine or utility package.

## Configuration
The template uses several configuration options from the service and method objects:
- `Name`: The name of the service or method.
- `Methods`: The collection of methods for a service.
- `IsStreamingClient`: A flag indicating if the method is a client-side streaming RPC.
- `IsStreamingServer`: A flag indicating if the method is a server-side streaming RPC.
- `Input`: The input type for the method.
- `Output`: The output type for the method.

These configuration options are likely defined in the data structure passed to the template engine when rendering.

This template is designed to generate Go interface definitions for gRPC-style services, accommodating different types of RPC methods (unary, client streaming, server streaming, and potentially bidirectional streaming).
