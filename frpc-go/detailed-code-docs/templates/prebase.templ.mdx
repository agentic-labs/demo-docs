title: "prebase.templ"
---

## High-level description
This file, `prebase.templ`, serves as a base template for other templates in the project. It includes two template blocks: "headers" and "imports". These blocks are likely to be defined in other template files and included here to provide a common structure for multiple pages or components.

## Code Structure
The file consists of two template calls using the Go template syntax. Each call references a different template block that will be populated with content when the template is rendered.

## Symbols

### `{{template "headers" .}}`
#### Description
This line includes the content of the "headers" template block. The dot (`.`) passed as an argument represents the current context or data that will be available to the "headers" template.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| . | interface{} | The current context or data passed to the template |

### `{{template "imports" .}}`
#### Description
This line includes the content of the "imports" template block. Similar to the "headers" template, the dot (`.`) is passed as an argument to provide the current context or data to the "imports" template.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| . | interface{} | The current context or data passed to the template |

## Dependencies
This template file depends on the existence of two other template blocks:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| headers | Likely contains HTML head elements or other header information |
| imports | Probably includes necessary import statements or references |

Note: The actual content of these template blocks is not visible in this file and would be defined elsewhere in the project.
