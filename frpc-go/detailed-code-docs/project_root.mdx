## High-level description
This repository contains the Go implementation of fRPC, a high-performance RPC framework designed for stability and efficiency. It uses the frisbee-go messaging framework under the hood and is compatible with Protocol Buffer (protobuf) definitions.

## What does it do?
fRPC-go provides a complete RPC system that allows developers to:

1. Define services and methods using Protocol Buffer syntax.
2. Generate Go code for both client and server implementations.
3. Implement high-performance RPC calls, including unary and streaming patterns.
4. Utilize optimizations for improved performance compared to other RPC frameworks like gRPC and Twirp.
5. Integrate with existing Go applications easily.

The framework handles various aspects of RPC communication, including:
- Code generation from protobuf definitions
- Serialization and deserialization of messages
- Network communication using the Frisbee messaging framework
- Error handling and logging
- Support for TLS and custom authentication

## Entry points
The main entry points for developers using fRPC-go are:

1. The `protoc-gen-go-frpc` plugin: Used with the Protocol Buffer compiler to generate Go code from .proto files.
2. The generated Go code: Provides interfaces and implementations for services defined in the .proto files.
3. The `pkg/generator` package: Contains the core logic for code generation, which can be extended or customized if needed.

For users of the framework, the primary interaction will be through the generated client and server code, which provides a high-level API for making and handling RPC calls.

## Key Files and Directories
1. `pkg/generator`: Contains the core code generation logic.
2. `protoc-gen-go-frpc`: The Protocol Buffer compiler plugin for generating fRPC Go code.
3. `templates`: Contains Go templates used for code generation.
4. `docs`: Comprehensive documentation including getting started guides and performance benchmarks.
5. `internal/version`: Manages the current version of the framework.
6. `CHANGELOG.md`: Documents changes and updates to the framework.
7. `README.md`: Provides an overview and usage instructions.

## Dependencies
Key dependencies of fRPC-go include:

1. Go (version 1.18 or later)
2. Protocol Buffer Compiler (protoc) version 3
3. github.com/loopholelabs/frisbee-go: The underlying messaging framework
4. github.com/loopholelabs/polyglot-go: Used for efficient serialization
5. google.golang.org/protobuf: For working with Protocol Buffer definitions
6. github.com/rs/zerolog: Used for logging in generated code

## Configuration
Configuration options for fRPC-go include:

1. Protocol Buffer definitions: Used to define services and methods.
2. Code generation options: Flags and options for the `protoc-gen-go-frpc` plugin.
3. TLS configuration: For secure communication in both client and server.
4. Logging configuration: Using zerolog for event logging.
5. Server concurrency settings: Controlling the number of concurrent goroutines handling RPCs.
6. Custom handlers: Extending the server with custom handlers for alternative messaging patterns.

The framework is designed to be highly configurable while providing sensible defaults for ease of use. Developers can fine-tune various aspects of the RPC system to meet their specific performance and functionality requirements.
