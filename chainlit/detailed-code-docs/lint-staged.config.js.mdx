## High-level description
This file configures lint-staged, a tool that runs linters and formatters on staged Git files. It defines rules for JavaScript, TypeScript, and Python files, ensuring code consistency and quality before commits.

## Symbols

### module.exports
#### Description
This object defines the lint-staged configuration, specifying which commands to run on which file types when they are staged for commit.

#### Internal Logic
The configuration is structured as key-value pairs, where keys are file glob patterns and values are arrays of commands or functions to be executed on matching files.

1. For JavaScript and TypeScript files (`**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}`):
   - Runs Prettier to format the code
   - Runs ESLint to fix any linting issues

2. For TypeScript files (`**/*.{ts,tsx}`):
   - Runs TypeScript compiler (tsc) to check for type errors without emitting output

3. For Python files (`**/*.py`):
   - Runs Black formatter
   - Runs isort with Black-compatible settings to sort imports

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| prettier | Code formatting for JavaScript and TypeScript files |
| eslint | Linting and fixing issues in JavaScript and TypeScript files |
| typescript | Type checking for TypeScript files |
| black | Code formatting for Python files |
| isort | Import sorting for Python files |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| **/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx} | Array | ["npx prettier --write", "npx eslint --fix"] | Commands to run on JavaScript and TypeScript files |
| **/*.{ts,tsx} | Array | [() =&gt; "tsc --skipLibCheck --noEmit"] | Command to run on TypeScript files for type checking |
| **/*.py | Array | ["black", "isort --profile=black"] | Commands to run on Python files |

## TODOs
The first line of the file contains an ESLint disable comment:
```javascript
// eslint-disable-next-line no-undef
```
This suggests that the `module.exports` statement is triggering an ESLint warning about an undefined variable. This is likely because the file is not being parsed as a CommonJS module. Consider updating the ESLint configuration to properly recognize this file as a CommonJS module instead of using the disable comment.
