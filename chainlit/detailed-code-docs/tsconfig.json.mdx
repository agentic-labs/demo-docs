## High-level description
This `tsconfig.json` file is a TypeScript configuration file specifically tailored for a Cypress testing environment. It defines compiler options and specifies which files should be included in the TypeScript compilation process for Cypress tests.

### compilerOptions
#### Description
The `compilerOptions` object specifies the compiler options to be used when compiling TypeScript files for the Cypress testing environment.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets the `lib` option to include both "ESNext" and "dom" libraries, allowing the use of the latest ECMAScript features and DOM APIs.
- Defines the `types` option to include type definitions for Cypress and Node.js, enabling proper type checking and autocompletion for these environments.

### include
#### Description
The `include` array specifies which files should be included in the TypeScript compilation process.

#### Internal Logic
- Includes all TypeScript files (`.ts`) located in the `cypress` directory and its subdirectories using the glob pattern `"cypress/**/*.ts"`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| TypeScript | The configuration is for TypeScript compilation |
| Cypress | The configuration is tailored for Cypress testing |
| Node.js | Type definitions for Node.js are included |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Value | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------|:------------|
| lib | array | ["ESNext", "dom"] | Specifies the library files to be included in the compilation |
| types | array | ["cypress", "node"] | Specifies the type declaration files to be included |
| include | array | ["cypress/**/*.ts"] | Specifies which files to include in the compilation |

This configuration ensures that TypeScript files in the Cypress testing environment have access to the latest ECMAScript features, DOM APIs, and proper type definitions for Cypress and Node.js. It focuses the compilation process on TypeScript files within the `cypress` directory, which is the standard location for Cypress test files.
