## High-level description
This directory contains GitHub-specific files and workflows that support the development process, contribution guidelines, and automation for the Chainlit project. It includes issue templates, contribution guidelines, and CI/CD workflows implemented using GitHub Actions.

## What does it do?
The `.github` directory serves several important functions:

1. Contribution Management: It provides a structured guide (CONTRIBUTING.md) for contributors, detailing how to set up the project locally, run tests, and start the Chainlit server and UI from source.

2. Issue Reporting: It contains templates for bug reports and feature requests, ensuring that users provide consistent and comprehensive information when reporting issues or suggesting new features.

3. Continuous Integration and Deployment: It includes GitHub Actions workflows that automate testing, type checking, end-to-end testing, and package publishing processes. These workflows run on various events such as pull requests, pushes to specific branches, and new releases.

## Key Files

1. `CONTRIBUTING.md`: A comprehensive guide for contributors, detailing the local setup process, how to run tests, and how to start the Chainlit server and UI from source.

2. `ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md`: A template for users to report bugs, including sections for describing the bug, steps to reproduce, expected behavior, and system information.

3. `ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md`: A template for users to suggest new features, including sections for describing the problem, proposing a solution, and considering alternatives.

4. `workflows/ci.yaml`: The main CI workflow that orchestrates the execution of tests, type checking, and end-to-end tests.

5. `workflows/pytest.yaml`: A reusable workflow for running pytest with coverage on the Python codebase.

6. `workflows/mypy.yaml`: A reusable workflow for running mypy static type checking on the Python code.

7. `workflows/e2e-tests.yaml`: A workflow for setting up and running end-to-end tests covering both the JavaScript UI and Python backend.

8. `workflows/publish.yaml`: A workflow that automates the process of building and publishing the Python package to PyPI.

## Dependencies
The project and its workflows rely on several key dependencies:

1. Python 3.9 or higher
2. Poetry for Python dependency management
3. Node.js 16.15.0 or higher
4. pnpm 8.6.9 for JavaScript package management
5. pytest and pytest-cov for Python testing
6. mypy for static type checking
7. Cypress for end-to-end testing

## Configuration
The GitHub workflows use various configuration options:

1. GitHub Secrets for storing sensitive information like PyPI credentials and Cypress record key.
2. Working directory configurations, typically set to `./backend` for Python-related jobs.
3. Specific versions for Python (3.9), Node.js (16.15.0), and pnpm (8.6.9).
4. Trigger events for workflows, including pull requests, pushes to main and dev branches, manual triggers, and new releases.

The issue templates use YAML front matter for configuration, specifying the template name, purpose, default labels, and other metadata.

This `.github` directory plays a crucial role in maintaining code quality, streamlining the contribution process, and automating key aspects of the development lifecycle for the Chainlit project.
