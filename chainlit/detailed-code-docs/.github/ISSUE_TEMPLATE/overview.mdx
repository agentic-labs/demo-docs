## High-level description
This directory contains issue templates for the GitHub repository. These templates are designed to standardize and streamline the process of submitting bug reports and feature requests. They provide a structured format for users to report issues or suggest new features, ensuring that the development team receives consistent and comprehensive information.

## What does it do?
The issue templates in this directory serve as pre-formatted forms that users fill out when creating new issues on the GitHub repository. They guide users to provide specific information about bugs or feature requests, making it easier for the development team to understand, prioritize, and address these issues effectively. The templates prompt users to include relevant details such as steps to reproduce a bug, expected behavior, system information, and context for feature requests.

## Key Files
1. `bug_report.md`: This file contains the template for reporting bugs. It includes sections for:
   - Describing the bug
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Expected behavior
   - Screenshots (if applicable)
   - System information (desktop and mobile)
   - Additional context

2. `feature_request.md`: This file contains the template for suggesting new features. It includes sections for:
   - Describing the problem related to the feature request
   - Proposing a solution
   - Describing alternative solutions considered
   - Additional context

Both templates use YAML front matter to define metadata such as the issue type, description, and initial labels.

## Configuration
The templates use YAML front matter for configuration:

```yaml
---
name: Bug report
about: Create a report to help us improve
title: ''
labels: needs-triage
assignees: ''
---
```

- `name`: Defines the name of the template as it appears in the issue creation interface
- `about`: Provides a brief description of the template's purpose
- `title`: Sets a default title for the issue (left blank in these templates)
- `labels`: Assigns initial labels to the issue (e.g., "needs-triage")
- `assignees`: Specifies default assignees for the issue (left blank in these templates)

These configurations help categorize and route issues appropriately as soon as they are created.

The templates use markdown formatting to structure the content and provide clear instructions to users. For example, the bug report template includes sections like:

```markdown
**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Go to '...'
2. Click on '....'
3. Scroll down to '....'
4. See error
```

This structure guides users to provide specific, actionable information that helps developers understand and address the reported issues efficiently.
