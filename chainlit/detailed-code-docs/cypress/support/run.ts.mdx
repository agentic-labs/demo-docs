## High-level description
This code provides functionality to run Chainlit for testing purposes. It includes a function to kill processes on a specific port and a main function to run Chainlit with different execution modes. The script is designed to be used in a Cypress testing environment.

## Code Structure
The main symbols in this code are the `killPort` function and the `runChainlitForTest` function. The `killPort` function is used within `runChainlitForTest` to ensure the target port is free before starting the Chainlit server.

## Symbols

### `killPort`
#### Description
This function kills processes running on a specified port. It uses different methods depending on the operating system.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| port | number | The port number to kill processes on |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Promise&lt;CmdResult&gt; | A promise that resolves with the command result |

#### Internal Logic
1. For Windows, it uses the `kill-port` library.
2. For other platforms, it uses `lsof` to find processes and `kill` to terminate them.

### `runChainlitForTest`
#### Description
This function runs Chainlit for testing purposes with specified test name and execution mode.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| testName | string | The name of the test to run |
| mode | ExecutionMode | The execution mode (Async or Sync) |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| server | Promise&lt;ChildProcess&gt; | A promise that resolves with the spawned server process |

#### Internal Logic
1. Attempts to kill any process running on the Chainlit port.
2. Determines the appropriate file to run based on the execution mode.
3. Spawns a new process using `poetry` to run Chainlit with specific options.
4. Resolves the promise when the server is ready, or rejects if there's an error.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| child_process | For spawning child processes |
| kill-port | For killing processes on Windows |
| path | For working with file paths |
| shell-exec | For executing shell commands |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| CHAINLIT_PORT | number | - | The port on which Chainlit runs |
| BACKEND_DIR | string | - | The directory of the backend |
| E2E_DIR | string | - | The directory for end-to-end tests |

## Error Handling
The code includes basic error handling:
- Logs errors when killing processes on the Chainlit port.
- Rejects the promise with an error message if the child process encounters an error or exits unexpectedly.

## Logging
The code uses `console.log` and `console.error` for logging server output and errors.

## Side Effects
- Kills processes running on the specified Chainlit port.
- Spawns a new child process to run Chainlit.

## Performance Considerations
The script waits for the Chainlit server to start before resolving, which may take some time depending on the system and network conditions.
