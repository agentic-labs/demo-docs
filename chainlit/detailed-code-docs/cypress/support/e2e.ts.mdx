## High-level description
This code is the entry point for running Cypress end-to-end tests. It sets up the environment, executes the tests based on an optional filter, and handles the process exit based on the test results.

## Code Structure
The main function sets up the environment and calls the `runTests` function from the `utils` module. The result is then handled in a promise chain to determine the process exit status.

## References
- `runTests` function from './utils'
- `dotenv` library for environment variable management

## Symbols

### `main`
#### Description
The main function that initializes the test environment and triggers the test execution.

#### Internal Logic
1. Loads environment variables using `dotenv.config()`.
2. Retrieves the `SINGLE_TEST` environment variable or defaults to '*' if not set.
3. Calls the `runTests` function with the test name filter.

### `main().then().catch()`
#### Description
A promise chain that handles the result of the `main` function execution.

#### Internal Logic
1. If the tests run successfully, logs "Done!" and exits with status code 0.
2. If an error occurs, logs the error and exits with status code 1.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| dotenv | Loading environment variables from a .env file |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| SINGLE_TEST | string | '*' | Environment variable to specify a single test to run |

## Error Handling
The code implements basic error handling by catching any errors thrown during the test execution and logging them before exiting the process with a non-zero status code.

## Performance Considerations
The use of `async/await` in the `main` function allows for efficient handling of asynchronous operations, which is important for test execution that may involve network requests or other I/O operations.

## Additional Notes
1. The code relies on the `runTests` function from the `utils` module, which is responsible for the actual test execution.
2. The `SINGLE_TEST` environment variable allows for running a specific test, which can be useful for debugging or focused testing.
3. The process exit codes (0 for success, 1 for failure) follow standard conventions for indicating the overall result of the test execution to the calling process or CI/CD system.
