## High-level description
This code represents a simple "Hello World" program written in C++. It's a basic example that demonstrates the minimal structure of a C++ program and how to output text to the console.

## Symbols

### `main`
#### Description
The `main` function is the entry point of the C++ program. It prints "Hello World!" to the console and returns 0 to indicate successful execution.

#### Inputs
This function takes no inputs.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| return value | int | Returns 0 to indicate successful program execution |

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses `std::cout` to print the string "Hello World!" to the console.
2. Returns 0 to indicate successful program execution.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| iostream | Provides input/output stream functionality, including `std::cout` for console output |

## Additional Notes
1. The code includes a comment at the top: "Your First C++ Program", indicating that this is likely meant as an introductory example for beginners learning C++.
2. The program uses the standard C++ input/output stream library (`iostream`) and the standard namespace (`std::`) to access the `cout` object for console output.
3. This program doesn't require any user input and will simply print "Hello World!" to the console when executed.
4. The code follows basic C++ syntax and structure, including the necessary `#include` directive, the `main` function declaration, and the use of the semicolon (`;`) to end statements.

This simple program serves as a starting point for learning C++ programming, demonstrating the basic structure of a C++ program and how to perform a simple output operation.
