## High-level description
This code defines a simple Chainlit application that responds with an "ok" message whenever a user sends a message. It utilizes the Chainlit library to handle message events and send responses.

## Symbols

### `main()`
#### Description
This asynchronous function serves as the main message handler for the Chainlit application. It is decorated with `@cl.on_message`, indicating that it will be called whenever a message is received.

#### Inputs
This function doesn't explicitly take any inputs. However, it is triggered by incoming messages in the Chainlit application.

#### Outputs
The function doesn't return any value directly. Instead, it sends a message using Chainlit's messaging system.

#### Internal Logic
1. When a message is received, the function is called.
2. It creates a new `cl.Message` object with the content "ok".
3. The message is then sent asynchronously using the `send()` method.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| chainlit | Used to create a chatbot or interactive AI application. It provides decorators for event handling and methods for sending messages. |

## Error Handling
This code doesn't implement any explicit error handling. It relies on the default error handling provided by the Chainlit library and the Python runtime.

## API/Interface Reference
While this code doesn't explicitly define an API, it integrates with Chainlit's event-driven interface:

| Event | Handler | Description |
|:------|:--------|:------------|
| on_message | main() | Triggered when a message is received in the Chainlit application. Responds with "ok". |

This simple implementation forms the basis of a Chainlit application that can be extended with more complex logic and interactions as needed.
