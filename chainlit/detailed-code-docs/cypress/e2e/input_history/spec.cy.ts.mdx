## High-level description
This Cypress test suite, located in `cypress/e2e/input_history/spec.cy.ts`, focuses on testing the input history functionality of a chat application. It verifies that the last submitted message can be retrieved from the message history and populated back into the chat input field.

## Code Structure
The test file imports utility functions from a separate `testUtils.ts` file and uses them to interact with the chat application. It contains a single test case within a describe block, which tests the message history functionality.

## References
This code references utility functions from `cypress/support/testUtils.ts`, including `runTestServer`, `openHistory`, `closeHistory`, and `submitMessage`.

## Symbols

### `describe('Input History', () =&gt; {...})`
#### Description
This is the main describe block that groups the tests related to the input history functionality.

#### Internal Logic
1. Runs a test server before executing the tests.
2. Contains a single test case for checking the message history functionality.

### `it('should be able to show the last message in the message history', () =&gt; {...})`
#### Description
This test case verifies that the last submitted message can be retrieved from the message history and populated back into the chat input field.

#### Internal Logic
1. Opens the history panel and checks that it's initially empty.
2. Closes the history panel.
3. Submits a new message with a unique timestamp.
4. Reopens the history panel and verifies the presence of the submitted message.
5. Clicks on the history item and checks that it populates the chat input field.
