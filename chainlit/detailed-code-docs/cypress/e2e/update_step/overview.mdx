## High-level description
This directory contains files related to testing the "Update Step" functionality in a Chainlit-based chat application. It includes a configuration file, a main Python script demonstrating the functionality, and a Cypress test specification file for automated testing.

## What does it do?
This directory implements and tests a feature where a chat application can create and update steps dynamically. The main script demonstrates how to send messages, create a step, and then update both the message and the step after a short delay. The Cypress test file automates the verification of this functionality, ensuring that the step is created and updated correctly in the user interface.

## Key Files

1. `.chainlit` (Configuration file):
   - Configures the Chainlit project settings, including telemetry, session management, and UI customization.
   - Enables features like the prompt playground and sets default UI behavior.

2. `main.py` (Main application script):
   - Implements the core functionality of creating and updating steps in the chat application.
   - Uses the Chainlit library to manage chat messages and steps.
   - Demonstrates asynchronous operations and timed updates.

3. `spec.cy.ts` (Cypress test specification):
   - Contains automated tests for the "Update Step" functionality.
   - Verifies that steps are created and updated correctly in the user interface.
   - Utilizes a custom `runTestServer` function to set up the test environment.

## Dependencies
The main dependencies for this project are:

1. Chainlit: Used for building the interactive chat application. The exact version is not specified in the provided files.

2. Cypress: Used for automated testing. The version is not explicitly mentioned in the provided files.

3. TypeScript: Used for writing the Cypress tests. The version is not specified in the provided files.

## Configuration
The `.chainlit` file provides configuration for the Chainlit project:

- Telemetry is enabled by default.
- Session timeout is set to 3600 seconds (1 hour).
- Caching is disabled.
- The prompt playground feature is enabled.
- The app and chatbot are named "Chatbot".
- Default UI settings are configured, such as collapsing large content and not expanding messages by default.

Additional configuration options are available but commented out, including theme customization.

## Code Examples

1. Creating and updating a step in `main.py`:

```python
@cl.on_chat_start
async def main():
    await cl.Message(content="Hello!").send()
    step = cl.Step(name="tool1", output="Foo")
    await step.send()
    await cl.sleep(1)
    await cl.Message(content="Hello again!").update()
    step.output += " Bar"
    await step.update()
```

2. Testing step updates in `spec.cy.ts`:

```typescript
it('should be able to update a step', () =&gt; {
  cy.get('#step-tool1').click()
  cy.get('.step').should('have.length', 2)
  cy.get('.step').first().should('contain', 'Foo')
  cy.get('.step').first().parent().should('contain', 'tool1')
  cy.get('.step').first().should('contain', 'Bar')
  cy.get('.step').first().parent().should('contain', 'tool1')
})
```

These examples showcase the core functionality of creating and updating steps, as well as how to test these updates using Cypress.
