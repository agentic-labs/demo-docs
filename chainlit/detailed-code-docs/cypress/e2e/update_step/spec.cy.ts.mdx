## High-level description
This Cypress test file (`spec.cy.ts`) contains a test suite for the "Update Step" functionality. It sets up a test server and verifies that a step can be updated correctly in the user interface.

## Symbols

### `describe('Update Step', ...)`
#### Description
This is the main test suite for the "Update Step" functionality. It sets up the test environment and contains a single test case.

#### Internal Logic
1. Before running the tests, it calls `runTestServer()` to set up the test environment.
2. It contains one test case that checks the ability to update a step.

### `it('should be able to update a step', ...)`
#### Description
This test case verifies that a step can be updated correctly in the user interface.

#### Internal Logic
1. Clicks on the element with ID `#step-tool1`.
2. Checks that there are two step elements on the page.
3. Verifies the content of the first step and its parent element.
4. Checks for updated content in the first step and its parent element.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `runTestServer` | Function imported from `../../support/testUtils` to set up the test server |

## References
- The test references elements with classes `.step` and IDs like `#step-tool1`, which are presumably part of the application being tested.
- The `runTestServer` function is imported from a utility file, which is included in the related code snippets.

## Notes on `runTestServer` function
From the related code snippet (`testUtils.ts`), we can see that `runTestServer` does the following:
1. Determines the test name from the current spec file path.
2. Executes a command to run a TypeScript node script with the test name and execution mode.
3. Visits the root URL ('/') after setting up the server.

This function is crucial for setting up the test environment before running the actual test cases.
