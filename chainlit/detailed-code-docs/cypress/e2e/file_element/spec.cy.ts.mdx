## High-level description
This Cypress test suite verifies the functionality of displaying file elements in a web application. It sets up a test server and checks if file elements are correctly rendered with the expected download attributes.

## Code Structure
The test suite consists of a single describe block containing one test case. It uses a custom utility function `runTestServer()` to set up the test environment before running the test.

## References
- `runTestServer()` function from '../../support/testUtils'

## Symbols

### `describe('file', () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
This is the main test suite for file-related functionality.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up the test server before running the tests.
2. Contains a single test case to verify the display of file elements.

### `before(() =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
Runs before all tests in the suite to set up the test environment.

#### Internal Logic
Calls the `runTestServer()` function to start the test server.

### `it('should be able to display a file element', () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
Tests the display of file elements on the page.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if there is exactly one element with the class 'step'.
2. Verifies that the 'step' element contains four elements with the class 'inline-file'.
3. Checks if the 'inline-file' elements have the correct 'download' attribute values.

#### Assertions
1. `.step` elements should have a length of 1.
2. The first `.step` element should contain 4 `.inline-file` elements.
3. The `download` attributes of `.inline-file` elements should match the expected file names: 'example.mp4', 'cat.jpeg', 'hello.py', and 'example.mp3'.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Cypress | End-to-end testing framework used for writing and running the tests |

## Configuration
The test relies on the configuration provided by the Cypress framework and the custom `runTestServer()` function.

## Error Handling
The test uses Cypress's built-in assertion mechanisms. If any assertion fails, the test will fail and provide detailed error information.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code.
