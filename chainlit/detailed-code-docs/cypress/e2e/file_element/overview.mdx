## High-level description
This directory contains files related to testing and configuring a Chainlit application that demonstrates the usage of file elements in a chat interface. It includes a Cypress test specification, a Python script for the main application logic, and a Chainlit configuration file.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory sets up and tests a chat application that can display various types of files (video, image, script, and audio) inline within chat messages. When a chat session starts, the application automatically sends a message containing these file elements. The Cypress test suite verifies that these file elements are correctly displayed on the web page with the expected attributes.

## Key Files

1. `main.py`:
   - This is the core application file written in Python using the Chainlit framework.
   - It defines a function that runs at the start of each chat session, creating and sending a message with inline file elements.
   - The file elements include a video (MP4), an image (JPEG), a Python script, and an audio file (MP3).

2. `spec.cy.ts`:
   - This is a Cypress test specification file written in TypeScript.
   - It contains a test suite that verifies the correct display of file elements in the web application.
   - The test checks for the presence of four inline file elements and verifies their download attributes.

3. `.chainlit`:
   - This is a TOML configuration file for the Chainlit project.
   - It defines various settings for the project, including telemetry, session management, and UI customization options.

## Dependencies
The project relies on the following main dependencies:

1. Chainlit: A framework for building chat applications. It's used in `main.py` to create and manage chat elements and messages.

2. Cypress: An end-to-end testing framework used in `spec.cy.ts` for writing and running tests on the web application.

## Configuration
The `.chainlit` file provides configuration for the Chainlit project:

- Telemetry is enabled by default.
- Session timeout is set to 3600 seconds (1 hour).
- Caching is disabled.
- The prompt playground feature is enabled.
- The app and chatbot are named "Chatbot".
- Default UI settings are configured, such as collapsing large content and not expanding messages by default.

## Code Snippets

Here's a key snippet from `main.py` that demonstrates how file elements are created and sent in a message:

```python
@cl.on_chat_start
async def start():
    elements = [
        cl.File(path="./public/example.mp4", name="example.mp4", display="inline", mime="video/mp4"),
        cl.File(path="./public/cat.jpeg", name="cat.jpeg", display="inline", mime="image/jpeg"),
        cl.File(path="./public/hello.py", name="hello.py", display="inline", mime="text/x-python"),
        cl.File(path="./public/example.mp3", name="example.mp3", display="inline", mime="audio/mpeg"),
    ]
    await cl.Message(content="Here are some files:", elements=elements).send()
```

And here's a snippet from `spec.cy.ts` showing how the file elements are tested:

```typescript
it('should be able to display a file element', () =&gt; {
  cy.get('.step').should('have.length', 1)
  cy.get('.step').first().find('.inline-file').should('have.length', 4)
  cy.get('.inline-file').each(($el, index) =&gt; {
    const expectedFileNames = ['example.mp4', 'cat.jpeg', 'hello.py', 'example.mp3']
    cy.wrap($el).should('have.attr', 'download', expectedFileNames[index])
  })
})
```

These snippets illustrate the core functionality of creating and testing file elements in the chat application.
