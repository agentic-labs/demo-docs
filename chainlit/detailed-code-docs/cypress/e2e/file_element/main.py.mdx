## High-level description
This code is a Chainlit application that demonstrates the usage of the File element. It creates and sends a message containing various file types (video, image, Python script, and audio) as inline elements when a chat session starts.

## Symbols

### `start()`
#### Description
This asynchronous function is triggered when a chat session begins. It creates a list of `cl.File` elements and sends a message containing these elements.

#### Inputs
This function doesn't take any explicit inputs.

#### Outputs
This function doesn't return any value explicitly.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a list of `cl.File` elements, each representing a different file type:
   - MP4 video file
   - JPEG image file
   - Python script file
   - MP3 audio file
2. Sends a message using `cl.Message` with the created file elements.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| chainlit | Used for creating and managing chat elements and messages |

## Side Effects
- Sends a message to the chat interface when the chat session starts.
- Loads files from the specified paths and displays them inline in the chat interface.

## Error Handling
This code doesn't implement explicit error handling. If file paths are incorrect or files are missing, it may raise exceptions during runtime.

## TODOs
- Consider adding error handling for file loading and message sending.
- Verify if the file paths are correct relative to the execution context.

## Notes
- The `@cl.on_chat_start` decorator suggests that this function is automatically called when a new chat session begins in the Chainlit application.
- The file paths are relative, assuming the script is run from a specific directory. Ensure the directory structure matches these relative paths.
- The `mime` types are specified for each file to ensure proper rendering in the chat interface.
- The `display="inline"` parameter for all files indicates that they should be displayed directly in the chat message, rather than as downloadable attachments.
