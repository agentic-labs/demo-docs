## High-level description
This directory contains files related to testing the "Remove Step" functionality in a chat-like interface built with Chainlit, a Python library for creating conversational AI applications. The directory includes a Cypress end-to-end test, a Python script demonstrating the functionality, and a Chainlit configuration file.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory implements and tests a feature that allows for the dynamic addition and removal of messages and steps in a chat interface. The main Python script (`main.py`) demonstrates how to create, send, and remove different types of messages and steps using Chainlit. The Cypress test (`spec.cy.ts`) verifies that these operations work correctly from a user's perspective, ensuring that steps can be removed, the interface updates appropriately, and new messages can be added after step removal.

## Key Files
1. `main.py`: This Python script serves as the main application file, demonstrating the usage of Chainlit to create a dynamic chat interface. It showcases various features such as sending messages, creating tool steps, and removing elements from the chat.

2. `spec.cy.ts`: This Cypress test file contains end-to-end tests for the "Remove Step" functionality. It verifies the correct behavior of step removal, interface updates, and the ability to submit new messages after step removal.

3. `.chainlit`: This TOML configuration file sets up various options for the Chainlit project, including telemetry, session management, and UI customization.

## Dependencies
The main dependencies for this project are:

1. Chainlit: A Python library for building conversational AI applications. It's used in `main.py` to create the chat interface and manage messages and steps.

2. Cypress: An end-to-end testing framework used in `spec.cy.ts` to automate browser-based tests of the chat interface.

## Configuration
The `.chainlit` file contains various configuration options for the Chainlit project:

- Telemetry is enabled by default
- Session timeout is set to 3600 seconds (1 hour)
- Caching is disabled
- The prompt playground feature is enabled
- The app and chatbot are named "Chatbot"
- Large content is collapsed by default
- Messages are not expanded by default
- Chain of thought details are shown in the UI

Here's a snippet of the configuration:

```toml
[project]
enable_telemetry = true
user_env = []
session_timeout = 3600
cache = false

[features]
prompt_playground = true

[UI]
name = "Chatbot"
default_collapse_content = true
default_expand_messages = false
hide_cot = false
```

The `main.py` file demonstrates the core functionality:

```python
@cl.on_chat_start
async def main():
    msg = cl.Message(content="Message 1")
    await msg.send()

    step = cl.Step(name="Tool step")
    await step.start()
    await cl.sleep(1)
    await step.end()

    await step.remove()

    msg2 = cl.Message(content="Message 2")
    await msg2.send()

    await msg.remove()
    await msg2.remove()

    msg3 = cl.AskUserMessage(content="Message 3")
    await msg3.send()

    await msg3.remove()
```

This script showcases the creation, sending, and removal of different types of messages and steps in the chat interface.

The Cypress test in `spec.cy.ts` verifies this functionality from a user's perspective:

```typescript
it('should be able to remove a step', () =&gt; {
    cy.get('.step').should('have.length', 1)
    cy.get('.step .message-content').should('contain', 'Message 1')
    // ... more test assertions ...
})
```

This test ensures that steps can be removed, the interface updates correctly, and new messages can be added after step removal.

In summary, this directory contains the necessary components to implement and test a dynamic chat interface with removable steps, leveraging Chainlit for the backend functionality and Cypress for end-to-end testing.
