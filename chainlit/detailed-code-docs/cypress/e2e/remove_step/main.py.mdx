## High-level description
This code demonstrates the usage of Chainlit, a Python library for building conversational AI applications. It showcases the creation, sending, and removal of different types of messages and steps in a chat-like interface, including regular messages, tool steps, and user prompts.

## Symbols

### `main()`
#### Description
This asynchronous function serves as the entry point for the chat interaction. It demonstrates various Chainlit features, including sending messages, creating steps, and removing elements from the chat interface.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
1. Sends an initial message ("Message 1")
2. Creates and executes a tool step
3. Removes the tool step
4. Sends a second message ("Message 2")
5. Removes the first and second messages
6. Sends a user prompt ("Message 3")
7. Removes the user prompt

The function includes sleep intervals between actions to create a visible sequence of events.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| chainlit | Provides the framework for building the conversational AI interface |

## Side Effects
The code interacts with the Chainlit interface, creating and removing various UI elements. These actions will be visible to the user interacting with the application.

## Error Handling
No explicit error handling is implemented in this code. It relies on Chainlit's built-in error handling mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference
The code uses several Chainlit API features:

| Feature | Description |
|:--------|:------------|
| `@cl.on_chat_start` | Decorator to define the function to be executed when a chat session starts |
| `cl.Message` | Creates a regular message in the chat interface |
| `cl.Step` | Creates a step (in this case, a tool step) in the chat interface |
| `cl.AskUserMessage` | Creates a message that prompts the user for input |
| `cl.sleep` | Introduces a delay in the execution |
| `message.send()` | Sends a message to the chat interface |
| `element.remove()` | Removes an element (message or step) from the chat interface |

This code serves as a demonstration of Chainlit's capabilities in managing a dynamic chat interface, showing how elements can be added and removed programmatically.
