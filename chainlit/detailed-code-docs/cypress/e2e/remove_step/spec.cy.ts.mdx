## High-level description
This Cypress test suite, "Remove Step," verifies the functionality of removing a step in a chat-like interface. It checks the presence and removal of steps, updates to the message content, and the ability to submit new messages after step removal.

## Symbols

### `describe('Remove Step', () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
This is the main test suite for the "Remove Step" functionality. It sets up the test environment and contains a single test case.

#### Internal Logic
1. Runs the test server before executing the test case.
2. Defines a single test case to verify step removal functionality.

### `before(() =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
This hook runs before the test case and sets up the test environment.

#### Internal Logic
Calls the `runTestServer()` function to start the test server.

### `it('should be able to remove a step', () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
This test case verifies the ability to remove a step and checks the resulting state of the interface.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks initial state: one step with "Message 1".
2. Clicks on a step tool to reveal a child message.
3. Verifies the removal of the step tool and updates to step content.
4. Checks the final state after step removal.
5. Submits a new message and verifies its presence.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @cypress/e2e | Cypress end-to-end testing framework |
| ../../support/testUtils | Custom test utilities for running the test server and submitting messages |

## References
- `runTestServer()`: Function from testUtils to start the test server.
- `submitMessage(message: string)`: Function from testUtils to submit a new message in the chat interface.

## Notes
1. The test uses Cypress commands (`cy.get()`, `cy.should()`, etc.) to interact with and assert on the DOM elements.
2. The test assumes a specific structure of the chat interface, including elements with classes like '.step' and '.message-content'.
3. The test uses a mix of DOM queries and assertions to verify the state of the interface at different stages of the test.
4. The test includes a slight pause (1000ms) before submitting a new message, likely to ensure the interface is ready for input.

This test provides a comprehensive check of the "Remove Step" functionality, ensuring that steps can be removed, the interface updates correctly, and new messages can be added after step removal.
