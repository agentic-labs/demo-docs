## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation and testing of a chat application with customizable chat profiles using the Chainlit library. The codebase includes configuration settings, the main application logic, and end-to-end tests for the chat profile functionality.

## What does it do?
The chat application allows users to interact with different GPT models (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and GPT-5) through a web interface. It provides the following key features:

1. User authentication: Users can log in with a username and password.
2. Role-based access: Admin users have access to different chat profiles.
3. Chat profile selection: Admin users can choose between different GPT models for their conversation.
4. Conversation starters: Predefined messages to help users begin conversations.
5. Message handling: The application processes user messages and responds accordingly.

The Cypress test suite verifies the functionality of selecting and changing chat profiles, ensuring that users can switch between different GPT models and that the selected profile is correctly applied to the conversation.

## Entry points
The main entry point for the application is the `main.py` file, which defines the core functionality of the chat application. The file structure is as follows:

1. `main.py`: Implements the chat application logic, including chat profiles, authentication, and message handling.
2. `.chainlit`: Contains configuration settings for the Chainlit project.
3. `spec.cy.ts`: Cypress test suite for verifying chat profile functionality.

The data flow in the application starts with user authentication, followed by chat profile selection (for admin users), and then message handling. The control flow is primarily managed by the Chainlit library, which uses decorators to define key functions like authentication callbacks and message handlers.

## Key Files

### main.py
This file is the core of the chat application, implementing the following key components:

1. Chat starters: Predefined conversation starters to help users begin interactions.
2. Chat profile setup: Defines available chat profiles based on user roles.
3. Authentication: Handles user login and role assignment.
4. Message handling: Processes incoming chat messages and generates responses.

Example of chat profile setup:

```python
@cl.set_chat_profiles
async def chat_profile(current_user: cl.User):
    if current_user.role != "ADMIN":
        return None
    return [
        cl.ChatProfile(
            name="GPT-3.5",
            markdown_description="This is the GPT-3.5 model",
            icon="https://picsum.photos/200",
        ),
        cl.ChatProfile(
            name="GPT-4",
            markdown_description="This is the GPT-4 model",
            icon="https://picsum.photos/200",
        ),
        cl.ChatProfile(
            name="GPT-5",
            markdown_description="This is the GPT-5 model",
            icon="https://picsum.photos/200",
        ),
    ]
```

### .chainlit
This TOML configuration file defines various settings for the Chainlit project, including:

1. Project-wide configurations (e.g., telemetry, session timeout)
2. Feature toggles (e.g., prompt playground, HTML processing)
3. UI customization options (e.g., chatbot name, content collapse behavior)

Example configuration:

```toml
[project]
enable_telemetry = true
session_timeout = 3600
cache = false

[features]
prompt_playground = true
unsafe_allow_html = false
latex = false

[UI]
name = "Chatbot"
default_collapse_content = true
default_expand_messages = false
```

### spec.cy.ts
This Cypress test suite verifies the chat profile functionality, including:

1. User login
2. Initial chat profile verification
3. Changing chat profiles
4. Starting new conversations with different profiles

Example test case:

```typescript
it('should be able to select a chat profile', () =&gt; {
  cy.login('admin', 'admin');
  cy.get('.cl-chat-profile-selector').should('contain', 'GPT-3.5');
  cy.get('.cl-chat-profile-selector').click();
  cy.get('.cl-chat-profile-option').contains('GPT-4').click();
  cy.get('.cl-chat-profile-selector').should('contain', 'GPT-4');
  // ... more test steps ...
});
```

## Dependencies
The main dependencies for this project are:

1. Chainlit: The core library used for building the chat application. It provides decorators and utilities for handling chat interactions, user management, and UI components.

2. Cypress: Used for end-to-end testing of the chat application. It allows for automated testing of the user interface and interactions.

## Configuration
The `.chainlit` file contains the main configuration options for the project. Key configurable fields include:

- `enable_telemetry`: Enables or disables telemetry (default: true)
- `session_timeout`: Duration in seconds for saving the session when connection is lost (default: 3600)
- `prompt_playground`: Shows or hides the prompt playground feature (default: true)
- `unsafe_allow_html`: Enables or disables HTML processing in messages (default: false)
- `name`: Name of the app and chatbot (default: "Chatbot")
- `default_collapse_content`: Collapses large content by default (default: true)
- `default_expand_messages`: Expands or collapses messages by default (default: false)

These configuration options allow for customization of the chat application's behavior and appearance.
