## High-level description
This Cypress test suite, 'Chat profiles', verifies the functionality of selecting and changing chat profiles in a chat application. It tests the user's ability to log in, start a conversation, select different chat profiles (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, GPT-5), and confirm that the selected profile is being used correctly.

## Code Structure
The test suite consists of a single test case that performs a series of actions and assertions to validate the chat profile selection feature. It utilizes helper functions from the `testUtils.ts` file for common operations like submitting messages and running the test server.

## References
- `cypress/support/testUtils.ts`: Contains utility functions used in the test, such as `runTestServer` and `submitMessage`.

## Symbols

### `describe('Chat profiles', () =&gt; {...})`
#### Description
This is the main test suite that encapsulates all the tests related to chat profiles.

#### Internal Logic
1. Runs the test server before executing the tests.
2. Contains a single test case for selecting and changing chat profiles.

### `it('should be able to select a chat profile', () =&gt; {...})`
#### Description
This test case verifies the ability to select and change chat profiles in the application.

#### Internal Logic
1. Logs in to the application.
2. Verifies the initial chat profile (GPT-3.5).
3. Changes the chat profile to GPT-4 and verifies the change.
4. Starts a new chat and changes the profile to GPT-5.
5. Performs various assertions throughout the process to ensure correct functionality.

## Error Handling
The test relies on Cypress's built-in error handling and assertion mechanisms. If any assertion fails or an expected element is not found, the test will fail automatically.

## Performance Considerations
The test includes several `cy.wait(1000)` commands, which introduce fixed delays. These might need adjustment based on the application's actual response times to ensure test reliability without unnecessary waiting.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code. However, consider the following potential improvements:
1. Replace fixed waits (`cy.wait(1000)`) with more robust waiting mechanisms, such as waiting for specific elements or network requests to complete.
2. Add more comprehensive tests for edge cases and error scenarios.
3. Consider parameterizing the test to run with different user roles or chat profile combinations.
