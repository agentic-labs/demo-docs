## High-level description
This directory contains files related to Cypress end-to-end tests for a Chainlit-based chatbot application, focusing on context management and synchronization utilities. The directory includes a configuration file, a Python script demonstrating Chainlit's context usage, and a Cypress test specification file.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory sets up and tests a chatbot application built with Chainlit. It demonstrates how to work with Chainlit's context and synchronization utilities in both synchronous and asynchronous environments. The main functionality includes:

1. Configuring the Chainlit project with various settings such as telemetry, session management, and UI customization.
2. Implementing a chat application that showcases different ways of accessing and using the Chainlit context, including asynchronous and synchronous function calls.
3. Testing the application to ensure that the Chainlit Emitter can be accessed from different contexts (async, make_async, and async_from_sync).

## Key Files

### .chainlit
This TOML configuration file defines various settings for the Chainlit project, including:
- Telemetry settings
- User environment variables
- Session timeout
- Caching options
- UI customization

Example configuration:

```toml
[project]
enable_telemetry = true
user_env = []
session_timeout = 3600
cache = false

[features]
prompt_playground = true

[UI]
name = "Chatbot"
default_collapse_content = true
default_expand_messages = false
hide_cot = false
```

### main.py
This Python script demonstrates the usage of Chainlit's context and synchronization utilities. It defines several functions that interact with the Chainlit context:

1. `async_function_from_sync()`: An asynchronous function that returns the Chainlit context's emitter.
2. `sync_function()`: A synchronous function that accesses the Chainlit context and runs an asynchronous function synchronously.
3. `async_function()`: An asynchronous function that calls another asynchronous function.
4. `main()`: The main entry point for the chat application, which demonstrates various ways of accessing the Chainlit context.

Example code snippet:

```python
@cl.on_chat_start
async def main():
    emitter = await async_function()
    await cl.Message(content=f"emitter from async found! {emitter}").send()

    emitter1, emitter2 = await make_async(sync_function)()
    await cl.Message(content=f"emitter from make_async found! {emitter1}").send()
    await cl.Message(content=f"emitter from async_from_sync found! {emitter2}").send()
```

### spec.cy.ts
This Cypress test specification file verifies that the Emitter can be found from different contexts. It sets up a test server and checks for the presence of specific content in three steps:

1. Emitter from async context
2. Emitter from make_async context
3. Emitter from async_from_sync context

Example test case:

```typescript
it('should find the Emitter from async, make_async and async_from_sync contexts', () =&gt; {
  cy.get('.step').should('have.length', 3)
  cy.get('.step').eq(0).should('contain', 'emitter from async found!')
  cy.get('.step').eq(1).should('contain', 'emitter from make_async found!')
  cy.get('.step').eq(2).should('contain', 'emitter from async_from_sync found!')
})
```

## Dependencies
The code in this directory relies on the following main dependencies:

1. Chainlit: The primary framework for building the chat-based application.
2. Cypress: The end-to-end testing framework used for verifying the application's functionality.

## Configuration
The `.chainlit` file serves as the main configuration file for the Chainlit project. It includes settings for:

- Telemetry (enabled by default)
- User environment variables (empty list)
- Session timeout (3600 seconds)
- Caching (disabled)
- UI customization (app name, content collapse, message expansion)

Developers can modify these settings to adjust the behavior of the Chainlit application as needed.

In summary, this directory contains the necessary components to set up, implement, and test a Chainlit-based chatbot application with a focus on context management and synchronization. The code demonstrates best practices for working with Chainlit's context in various scenarios and provides a comprehensive test suite to ensure proper functionality.
