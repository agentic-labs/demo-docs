## High-level description
This code demonstrates the usage of Chainlit's context and synchronization utilities in a Cypress end-to-end test environment. It showcases how to work with asynchronous and synchronous functions while maintaining the Chainlit context, and how to use Chainlit's messaging system to report the results.

## Code Structure
The code defines several functions (both synchronous and asynchronous) that interact with the Chainlit context. The main entry point is the `main()` function, which is decorated with `@cl.on_chat_start`. This function calls the other defined functions and sends messages based on their results.

## Symbols

### `async_function_from_sync()`
#### Description
An asynchronous function that simulates a delay and returns the Chainlit context's emitter.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| return | BaseChainlitEmitter | The emitter from the Chainlit context |

#### Internal Logic
1. Waits for 2 seconds using `cl.sleep()`
2. Returns the emitter from the Chainlit context

### `sync_function()`
#### Description
A synchronous function that demonstrates accessing the Chainlit context and running an asynchronous function synchronously.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| return | Tuple[BaseChainlitEmitter, BaseChainlitEmitter] | A tuple containing two emitters |

#### Internal Logic
1. Gets the emitter directly from the context
2. Runs `async_function_from_sync()` synchronously using `run_sync()`
3. Returns both emitters as a tuple

### `async_function()`
#### Description
An asynchronous function that calls another asynchronous function.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| return | BaseChainlitEmitter | The emitter from the Chainlit context |

### `another_async_function()`
#### Description
An asynchronous function that simulates a delay and returns the Chainlit context's emitter.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| return | BaseChainlitEmitter | The emitter from the Chainlit context |

#### Internal Logic
1. Waits for 2 seconds using `cl.sleep()`
2. Returns the emitter from the Chainlit context

### `main()`
#### Description
The main entry point for the chat application, decorated with `@cl.on_chat_start`. It demonstrates various ways of accessing the Chainlit context and sends messages based on the results.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls `async_function()` and sends a message based on the result
2. Calls `sync_function()` using `make_async()` to convert it to an asynchronous function
3. Sends messages based on the results from `sync_function()`

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| chainlit | Main framework for building chat-based applications |
| chainlit.context | Provides access to the Chainlit context |
| chainlit.sync | Utilities for working with synchronous and asynchronous functions |

## Error Handling
The code uses Chainlit's `ErrorMessage` to report when emitters are not found in the expected places. This provides a way to communicate errors to the user in the chat interface.

## Performance Considerations
The code uses `cl.sleep()` to simulate delays, which may impact performance in a real-world scenario. In production, these would likely be replaced with actual time-consuming operations.
