## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation and testing of a simple chatbot application using Chainlit. The application asks the user for their name and responds with a confirmation message. The directory includes the main Python script, a Cypress test file for end-to-end testing, and a Chainlit configuration file.

## What does it do?
The chatbot application initiates a conversation by asking the user for their name. When the user responds, the application acknowledges the input by sending a confirmation message. This simple interaction demonstrates the basic functionality of a chatbot using the Chainlit framework.

The Cypress test file ensures that the chatbot correctly displays the user's input in the chat interface. It simulates a user submitting a message and verifies that the message appears in the chat history.

## Key Files

1. `main.py`: This is the core Python script that implements the chatbot functionality using Chainlit. It defines an asynchronous function that handles the chat interaction, prompting the user for their name and responding with a confirmation message.

2. `spec.cy.ts`: This Cypress test file contains a test suite for the "Ask User" functionality. It verifies that when a user submits a message, the application correctly displays the input in the chat interface.

3. `.chainlit`: This TOML configuration file defines various settings for the Chainlit project, including telemetry, session management, UI customization, and feature toggles.

## Dependencies
The main dependency for this project is the Chainlit library, which is used to create the chatbot interface and handle user interactions. The version is not specified in the provided files.

For testing, the project uses Cypress, an end-to-end testing framework for web applications.

## Configuration
The `.chainlit` file contains the configuration for the Chainlit project. Key configuration options include:

- `enable_telemetry`: Set to true by default
- `session_timeout`: Set to 3600 seconds (1 hour)
- `cache`: Set to false, disabling third-party caching
- `prompt_playground`: Set to true, enabling the prompt playground feature
- `name`: Set to "Chatbot" for both the app and chatbot name
- `default_collapse_content`: Set to true, collapsing large content by default
- `default_expand_messages`: Set to false, not expanding messages by default

Additional UI customization options, such as theme settings, are available but commented out in the configuration file.

## Code Snippets

Here's the main chatbot logic from `main.py`:

```python
@cl.on_chat_start
async def main():
    res = await cl.AskUserMessage(content="What is your name?", timeout=10).send()
    if res:
        await cl.Message(f"Your name is {res['content']}").send()
```

This function uses Chainlit's `AskUserMessage` to prompt the user for their name and then sends a confirmation message using `cl.Message`.

The Cypress test in `spec.cy.ts` verifies the chatbot's functionality:

```typescript
it('should send a new message containing the user input', () =&gt; {
    cy.get('.step').should('have.length', 1);
    submitMessage('Jeeves');
    cy.wait(2000);
    cy.get('.step').should('have.length', 3);
    cy.get('.step').eq(2).should('contain', 'Jeeves');
});
```

This test submits a message "Jeeves" and checks that it appears correctly in the chat interface.

In summary, this directory contains a simple yet functional chatbot implementation using Chainlit, along with configuration and testing files to ensure its proper operation.
