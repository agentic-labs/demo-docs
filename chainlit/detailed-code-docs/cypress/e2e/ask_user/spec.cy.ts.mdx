## High-level description
This Cypress test file (`spec.cy.ts`) contains a test suite for the "Ask User" functionality. It verifies that when a user submits a message, the application correctly displays the input in the chat interface.

## Code Structure
The test suite uses helper functions from the `testUtils` module to set up the test environment and interact with the chat interface.

## References
- `runTestServer` and `submitMessage` functions from `../../support/testUtils`

## Symbols

### `describe('Ask User', ...)`
#### Description
This is the main test suite for the "Ask User" functionality.

#### Internal Logic
1. Before running the tests, it sets up the test server using `runTestServer()`.
2. Contains a single test case to verify message submission and display.

### `it('should send a new message containing the user input', ...)`
#### Description
This test case verifies that a user-submitted message is correctly displayed in the chat interface.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks that initially there is only one step (message) in the chat.
2. Submits a message "Jeeves" using the `submitMessage` function.
3. Waits for 2 seconds to allow for message processing.
4. Verifies that there are now three steps (messages) in the chat.
5. Checks that the third step contains the submitted message "Jeeves".

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Cypress | End-to-end testing framework |

## Performance Considerations
The test includes a 2-second wait after submitting the message. This might need adjustment based on the application's response time to ensure test reliability.

## Additional Notes

### Test Server Setup
The test uses `runTestServer()` from the `testUtils` module to set up the test environment. This function likely starts a local server instance for testing purposes.

### Message Submission
The `submitMessage()` function from `testUtils` is used to simulate user input. Based on the implementation in the related code snippet, it waits for 1 second, ensures the chat input is enabled, and then types the message followed by an Enter key press.

### Assertions
The test makes several assertions using Cypress commands:
1. It checks the initial number of steps (messages) in the chat.
2. After submitting a message, it verifies the updated number of steps.
3. It ensures that the submitted message appears in the correct position in the chat interface.

These assertions help verify that the "Ask User" functionality is working as expected, correctly processing and displaying user input.
