## High-level description
This Cypress test suite, named "Action", verifies the correct execution and display of various action buttons in a web application. It tests the functionality of clicking different action buttons, checking their effects on the UI, and ensuring proper removal of buttons when specific actions are triggered.

## Code Structure
The test suite consists of a single describe block containing one test case. It uses Cypress commands to interact with UI elements and assert their behavior.

## References
The code references the `runTestServer` function from the `../../support/testUtils` module.

## Symbols

### `describe('Action', () =&gt; {...})`
#### Description
This is the main test suite for the Action functionality.

#### Internal Logic
1. Runs the test server before executing the tests.
2. Contains a single test case that checks various action button behaviors.

### `it('should correctly execute and display actions', () =&gt; {...})`
#### Description
This test case verifies the behavior of different action buttons in the application.

#### Internal Logic
The test performs the following steps:
1. Clicks on "first action" and verifies the result.
2. Clicks on "test action" and checks its execution.
3. Clicks on "removable action" and ensures it's removed after execution.
4. Opens the action drawer and clicks on "multiple action one", verifying its removal.
5. Clicks on "multiple action two" and checks its removal.
6. Clicks on "all actions removed" and verifies that all action buttons are removed.

For each action, the test:
- Checks if the button exists before clicking.
- Clicks the button.
- Verifies the number of steps displayed.
- Checks the content of the newly added step.
- Verifies the existence or non-existence of buttons after the action.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Cypress | End-to-end testing framework used for writing and running the tests |

## Configuration
The test uses a custom `runTestServer` function to set up the test environment before running the tests.

## Performance Considerations
The test includes several `cy.wait(100)` commands, which introduce small delays between actions. These delays might be necessary to ensure proper rendering or state updates in the application being tested.
