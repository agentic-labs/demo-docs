## High-level description
This directory contains files related to testing and configuring a Chainlit-based chatbot application with a focus on action functionality. It includes a Cypress end-to-end test suite, a Python script demonstrating Chainlit's action system, and a TOML configuration file for the Chainlit project.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory sets up and tests a chatbot application that can perform various actions in response to user interactions. The main functionality includes:

1. Configuring the Chainlit project with settings for telemetry, session management, and UI customization.
2. Implementing a chatbot that can display and handle multiple types of actions, such as test actions, removable actions, and multiple actions.
3. Testing the action functionality using Cypress to ensure that action buttons are correctly displayed, executed, and removed as expected.

The workflow typically involves:
1. Setting up the chatbot with predefined actions.
2. Presenting these actions to the user as clickable buttons.
3. Responding to user interactions by executing the corresponding action callbacks.
4. Updating the UI based on the action results, such as removing buttons or displaying confirmation messages.
5. Automated testing of this entire process to ensure reliability and correctness.

## Key Files

### 1. main.py
This file contains the core logic for the Chainlit chatbot application. It defines several action callbacks and a main function that sets up the initial chat interface. Key features include:

- Multiple action types: test actions, removable actions, and multiple actions.
- Action callback functions that handle user interactions.
- Dynamic removal of actions based on user input.
- Use of Chainlit's messaging system to communicate with users.

Example of an action callback:

```python
@cl.action_callback("removable action")
async def on_action(action: cl.Action):
    await cl.Message(content="Executed removable action!").send()
    await action.remove()
```

### 2. spec.cy.ts
This Cypress test file verifies the correct execution and display of various action buttons in the web application. It includes a comprehensive test case that:

- Clicks on different action buttons.
- Verifies the execution of actions.
- Checks for proper removal of buttons after specific actions.
- Ensures the correct number of steps are displayed after each action.

Example of a test step:

```typescript
cy.contains('button', 'first action').click();
cy.get('.step').should('have.length', 2);
cy.get('.step').last().should('contain', 'Executed first action!');
```

### 3. .chainlit
This TOML configuration file sets up various aspects of the Chainlit project, including:

- Telemetry settings
- Session timeout
- UI customization options
- Feature toggles

Example configuration:

```toml
[project]
enable_telemetry = true
session_timeout = 3600

[UI]
name = "Chatbot"
default_collapse_content = true
```

## Dependencies
The main dependencies for this project are:

1. Chainlit: The core framework used for building the chatbot application. It provides the action system, messaging capabilities, and project configuration.

2. Cypress: Used for end-to-end testing of the web application. It allows for automated interaction with the chatbot interface and verification of its behavior.

## Configuration
The `.chainlit` file contains various configuration options for the project. Key configurations include:

- Telemetry enabled by default
- Session timeout set to 3600 seconds (1 hour)
- Caching disabled
- Prompt playground feature enabled
- UI name set to "Chatbot"
- Default content collapse enabled

Developers can modify these settings to customize the behavior and appearance of the chatbot application.

This directory demonstrates a comprehensive approach to building and testing a Chainlit-based chatbot with advanced action functionality, ensuring a robust and interactive user experience.
