## High-level description
This Cypress test file (`spec.cy.ts`) verifies the chat context functionality in a chat application. It checks if the chat history is correctly maintained and updated as new messages are submitted.

## Symbols

### `describe('Chat Context', () =&gt; {...})`
#### Description
This is the main test suite for the Chat Context functionality. It sets up the test environment and contains individual test cases.

#### Internal Logic
1. Before running the tests, it calls `runTestServer()` to set up the test environment.
2. It contains one test case that checks the chat context length.

### `it('should be able to current conversation chat history', () =&gt; {...})`
#### Description
This test case verifies that the chat context is correctly updated as new messages are submitted.

#### Internal Logic
1. Submits the first message "Hello 1" using the `submitMessage` function.
2. Checks if the chat context length is 1 after the first message.
3. Submits the second message "Hello 2".
4. Checks if the chat context length is 3 after the second message (including both user messages and the AI response).

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `runTestServer` | Sets up the test environment |
| `submitMessage` | Submits a message in the chat interface |

## References
The test file references the following external functions:
- `runTestServer`: Imported from '../../support/testUtils'
- `submitMessage`: Imported from '../../support/testUtils'

These functions are defined in the related `testUtils.ts` file and are crucial for setting up the test environment and interacting with the chat interface.

## Notes
1. The test assumes that there's a `.step` element in the DOM that displays the chat context length.
2. The chat context length increases by 2 after the second message (from 1 to 3), which suggests that there's an AI response included in the context between the two user messages.
3. The test uses Cypress commands like `cy.get()` and `cy.should()` to interact with and assert on DOM elements.
4. There's a 1-second wait built into the `submitMessage` function (as seen in the related `testUtils.ts` file) to allow for any asynchronous operations to complete.

This test ensures that the chat application correctly maintains and updates the conversation history as new messages are added, which is crucial for providing context in ongoing conversations.
