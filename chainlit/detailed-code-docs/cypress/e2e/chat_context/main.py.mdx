## High-level description
This code defines a Chainlit application that responds to incoming messages by sending a message containing the current length of the chat context. It utilizes the Chainlit library to handle message events and manage the chat context.

## Symbols

### `main()`
#### Description
This asynchronous function is the main handler for incoming messages in the Chainlit application. It sends a message back to the user with the current length of the chat context.

#### Inputs
This function doesn't explicitly take any inputs, but it implicitly uses the global `cl.chat_context` object.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| None | None | The function doesn't return a value, but it sends a message using `cl.Message().send()` |

#### Internal Logic
1. The function is decorated with `@cl.on_message`, indicating it should be called whenever a message is received.
2. It creates a new `cl.Message` object with content that includes the length of the current chat context.
3. The message is sent asynchronously using the `send()` method.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| chainlit | Provides the framework for building conversational AI applications |

## API/Interface Reference
While this code doesn't explicitly define an API, it implicitly creates an interface through the Chainlit framework:

| Event | Handler | Description |
|:------|:--------|:------------|
| Message Received | `main()` | Responds with the current chat context length |

This interface is defined by the `@cl.on_message` decorator, which registers the `main()` function as the handler for incoming messages.
