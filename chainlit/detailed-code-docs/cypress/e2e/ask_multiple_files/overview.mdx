## High-level description
This directory contains files for a Chainlit chatbot project that focuses on handling multiple file uploads. It includes a main Python script for the chatbot functionality, a Cypress test suite for end-to-end testing, and a Chainlit configuration file.

## What does it do?
The project implements a chatbot that prompts users to upload Python files and acknowledges the uploaded files. The chatbot interface allows users to upload 1-2 Python files, and then it confirms the number of files uploaded along with their names. The Cypress test suite verifies this functionality by simulating the upload of two different file types (a text file and a Python file) and checking if the UI correctly reflects the upload status.

## Key Files
1. `main.py`: This is the core Python script that implements the Chainlit chatbot. It defines an asynchronous `start()` function that handles the file upload process and user interaction.

2. `spec.cy.ts`: This Cypress test file contains end-to-end tests for the file upload functionality. It verifies that the application can receive two files and correctly display the upload status in the UI.

3. `.chainlit`: This TOML configuration file sets various parameters for the Chainlit project, including UI customization, feature toggles, and session management settings.

## Dependencies
The project relies on the following main dependencies:

1. Chainlit: Used for creating the chat interface and handling file uploads in the main Python script.
2. Cypress: Employed for end-to-end testing of the file upload functionality.

## Configuration
The `.chainlit` file contains various configuration options for the project:

```toml
[project]
enable_telemetry = true
session_timeout = 3600
cache = false

[features]
prompt_playground = true
multi_modal.enabled = true
multi_modal.max_files = 20
multi_modal.max_size_mb = 500

[UI]
name = "Chatbot"
show_readme_as_default = true
default_collapse_content = true
default_expand_messages = false
hide_cot = false
```

Key configuration points include:
- Telemetry is enabled
- Session timeout is set to 1 hour
- Multi-modal file uploads are enabled with a limit of 20 files and 500MB total size
- The chatbot is named "Chatbot"
- Large content is collapsed by default, while messages are not expanded by default

The configuration file also includes commented-out options for further customization of the UI theme and other features.

In summary, this directory contains a Chainlit chatbot project focused on handling multiple file uploads, complete with a main script, end-to-end tests, and configuration settings. The chatbot prompts users to upload Python files and acknowledges the uploads, while the test suite ensures the functionality works as expected.
