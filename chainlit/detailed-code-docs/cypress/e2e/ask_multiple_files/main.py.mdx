## High-level description
This code implements a Chainlit chatbot that prompts users to upload Python files and then acknowledges the uploaded files. It uses the Chainlit library to handle file uploads and send messages in a chat interface.

## Symbols

### `start()`
#### Description
This asynchronous function is triggered at the start of a chat session. It prompts the user to upload Python files, receives the uploaded files, and sends a confirmation message.

#### Inputs
This function doesn't take any explicit inputs, but it interacts with user inputs through the Chainlit interface.

#### Outputs
This function doesn't return any values, but it sends messages to the chat interface.

#### Internal Logic
1. Prompts the user to upload Python files using `cl.AskFileMessage`.
2. Waits for the user to upload files (1 to 2 Python files).
3. Extracts the names of the uploaded files.
4. Sends a confirmation message with the number of files uploaded and their names.

## Error Handling
This code doesn't implement explicit error handling. It relies on Chainlit's built-in error handling for file uploads and message sending.

## Logging
This code doesn't implement any explicit logging mechanisms.
