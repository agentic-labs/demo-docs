## High-level description
This Cypress test suite verifies the functionality of uploading multiple files in a web application. It focuses on testing the ability to upload two different file types and checks if the UI correctly reflects the upload status.

## Symbols

### `describe('Upload multiple files', () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
This is the main test suite that encapsulates the file upload test scenario.

#### Internal Logic
1. Runs a test server before executing the tests.
2. Contains a single test case for uploading multiple files.

### `before(() =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
This hook runs before the test suite and sets up the test environment.

#### Internal Logic
Calls the `runTestServer()` function to start the test server.

### `it('should be able to receive two files', () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
This test case verifies the ability to upload two different files and checks the UI response.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks for the existence of the upload button.
2. Loads two fixture files: a text file and a Python file.
3. Simulates file selection using the `selectFile` method.
4. Verifies that the UI displays the correct number and names of uploaded files.
5. Checks that the upload button is no longer visible after the upload.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| cypress | End-to-end testing framework |
| @cypress/fixture | Used to load test files |

## References
- `runTestServer()`: This function is imported from '../../support/testUtils' and is used to start the test server before running the tests.

## Notes
1. There's a commented-out section that checks for a loading indicator. This suggests that the file upload might be too fast in some cases to show the loading state.
2. The test uses Cypress commands like `cy.get()`, `cy.fixture()`, and `cy.should()` to interact with the UI and make assertions.
3. The test uses the `force: true` option when selecting files, which might be necessary if the file input is hidden or not directly interactable.

## Error Handling
The test doesn't explicitly handle errors, relying on Cypress's built-in error handling and assertion mechanisms.

## Performance Considerations
The test includes a note about the file upload potentially being too fast to show a loading indicator, which could be relevant for performance testing or user experience considerations.
