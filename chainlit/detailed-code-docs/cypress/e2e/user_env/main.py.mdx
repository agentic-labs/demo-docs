## High-level description
This code defines a Chainlit application that responds to user messages by retrieving a value from the user's environment and sending it back as a message. It demonstrates how to access user-specific environment variables in a Chainlit application.

## Symbols

### `main()`
#### Description
This asynchronous function is the main handler for incoming messages in the Chainlit application. It retrieves a specific key from the user's environment and sends a message containing the key and its value.

#### Inputs
This function doesn't explicitly take any inputs, but it uses the global `cl.user_session` object.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| None | None | The function doesn't return a value, but it sends a message using `cl.Message`. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Defines a constant `key` with the value "TEST_KEY".
2. Retrieves the user's environment dictionary from `cl.user_session.get("env")`.
3. Gets the value associated with `key` from the user's environment.
4. Creates and sends a message containing the key and its value using `cl.Message`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| chainlit | Provides the framework for building conversational AI applications |

## Error Handling
This code doesn't implement explicit error handling. If the key is not found in the user's environment, the `get` method will return `None` by default, which will be reflected in the sent message.

## Logging
The code doesn't implement any explicit logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference
The code uses the Chainlit API, specifically:

| Chainlit Feature | Usage |
|:-----------------|:------|
| `@cl.on_message` | Decorator to define the message handler |
| `cl.user_session` | Accessing user-specific session data |
| `cl.Message` | Sending messages back to the user |

Note: The exact behavior and availability of these features may depend on the specific version of Chainlit being used.
