## High-level description
This directory contains files for a Cypress end-to-end test suite focused on testing user environment functionality in a Chainlit application. It includes a configuration file, a Python script defining the main application logic, and a Cypress test specification.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory sets up and tests a simple Chainlit application that interacts with user-specific environment variables. The main functionality allows users to input a required key-value pair, which is then stored in their session environment. When a user sends a message, the application retrieves the stored value and sends it back as a response. The Cypress test suite verifies this workflow by simulating user input, sending a message, and checking the response.

## Key Files

1. `.chainlit` (Configuration file):
   - Defines project settings, feature toggles, and UI customization for the Chainlit application.
   - Specifies a required user environment variable "TEST_KEY".
   - Configures session timeout and disables caching.
   - Enables the prompt playground feature.
   - Customizes the chatbot name and UI behavior.

2. `main.py` (Application logic):
   - Implements the core functionality of the Chainlit application.
   - Defines a message handler that retrieves the "TEST_KEY" value from the user's environment.
   - Sends a response message containing the key and its value.

3. `spec.cy.ts` (Cypress test specification):
   - Contains a test suite for verifying the user environment functionality.
   - Simulates user input of a required key-value pair.
   - Sends a test message and checks if the response contains the submitted value.

## Dependencies
The project relies on the following main dependencies:

1. Chainlit: A framework for building conversational AI applications. Used in `main.py` to handle user interactions and manage sessions.

2. Cypress: An end-to-end testing framework used in `spec.cy.ts` for writing and running automated tests.

## Configuration
The `.chainlit` file contains various configuration options:

```toml
[project]
enable_telemetry = true
user_env = ["TEST_KEY"]
session_timeout = 3600
cache = false

[features]
prompt_playground = true

[UI]
name = "Chatbot"
default_collapse_content = true
default_expand_messages = false
hide_cot = false
```

Key configuration points:
- Telemetry is enabled.
- "TEST_KEY" is set as a required user environment variable.
- Session timeout is set to 1 hour (3600 seconds).
- Caching for third-party services is disabled.
- The prompt playground feature is enabled.
- UI customizations include setting the chatbot name and default content behavior.

## Code Examples

1. Main application logic (`main.py`):

```python
import chainlit as cl

@cl.on_message
async def main():
    key = "TEST_KEY"
    env = cl.user_session.get("env")
    value = env.get(key)
    await cl.Message(content=f"The value for {key} is {value}").send()
```

This code defines a message handler that retrieves the "TEST_KEY" value from the user's environment and sends it back as a response.

2. Cypress test case (`spec.cy.ts`):

```typescript
it('should be able to ask a user for required keys', () =&gt; {
    const key = 'TEST_KEY';
    const value = 'test_value';

    cy.get('#env').should('exist');
    cy.get(`input[name="${key}"]`).type(value);
    cy.get('button').contains('Submit').click();

    submitMessage('Hello');

    cy.get('.steps').children().should('have.length', 2);
    cy.get('.steps').children().eq(1).should('contain', value);
});
```

This test case simulates user input of the required key-value pair, sends a test message, and verifies that the response contains the submitted value.

The code in this directory demonstrates a simple yet effective way to handle user-specific environment variables in a Chainlit application and provides a comprehensive test suite to ensure its functionality.
