## High-level description
This Cypress test suite, named "User Env", verifies the functionality of asking a user for required keys in an environment setup. It tests the ability to input a key-value pair and submit it, followed by sending a message and checking if the submitted value appears in the response.

## Code Structure
The test suite consists of a single test case within a `describe` block. It utilizes helper functions from the `testUtils` module to set up the test environment and interact with the UI.

## References
- `runTestServer` and `submitMessage` functions from '../../support/testUtils'

## Symbols

### `describe('User Env', () =&gt; {...})`
#### Description
This is the main test suite that groups related tests for the user environment functionality.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up the test environment using `runTestServer()` in the `before` hook.
2. Contains a single test case to verify the user input for required keys.

### `it('should be able to ask a user for required keys', () =&gt; {...})`
#### Description
This test case verifies that the application can ask a user for required keys, submit the input, and display the entered value in the response.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up test variables for the key and its value.
2. Checks for the existence of the '#env' element.
3. Locates the input field for the test key, types the value, and submits it.
4. Submits a "Hello" message using the `submitMessage` helper function.
5. Verifies that there are two steps in the response.
6. Checks if the second step contains the entered key value.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Cypress | End-to-end testing framework used for writing and running the tests |

## Error Handling
This test does not implement explicit error handling. It relies on Cypress's built-in assertion and timeout mechanisms to handle failures.
