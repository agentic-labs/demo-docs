## High-level description
This directory contains files related to testing the "Starters" functionality of a Chainlit application. It includes a Python file (`main.py`) that implements the Chainlit application with starter messages and message handling, and a Cypress test file (`spec.cy.ts`) that verifies the functionality of the starters feature.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory sets up a conversational AI application using Chainlit and provides a way to test its "Starters" feature. The main application (`main.py`) defines a set of starter options that users can choose from to begin a conversation, and implements a simple echo functionality for handling messages. The Cypress test file (`spec.cy.ts`) automates the process of interacting with a starter option and verifies that the application responds correctly.

## Key Files

### main.py
This file implements the core functionality of the Chainlit application. It defines two main functions:

1. `starters()`: This function sets up three starter options for the conversation, each with a unique label and message.
2. `on_message(msg)`: This function handles incoming messages by echoing back the content of the received message.

The use of Chainlit decorators (`@cl.set_starters` and `@cl.on_message`) integrates these functions into the Chainlit framework.

### spec.cy.ts
This Cypress test file contains a test suite for the "Starters" functionality. It includes:

1. A setup step that runs a test server before executing the tests.
2. A test case that verifies a user can interact with a starter option.

The test checks for the presence of specific elements and their content after interacting with a starter.

## Dependencies
1. Chainlit: Used in `main.py` for building the conversational AI application.
2. Cypress: Used in `spec.cy.ts` for end-to-end testing of the application.

## Configuration
The test file (`spec.cy.ts`) relies on a `runTestServer()` function imported from a separate `testUtils.ts` file. This function is used to set up the test environment and may accept optional parameters for execution mode and environment variables.

Here's an example of how the test is structured:

```typescript
import { runTestServer } from '../../support/testUtils';

describe('Starters', () =&gt; {
  before(() =&gt; {
    runTestServer();
  });

  it('should be able to use a starter', () =&gt; {
    cy.wait(1000);
    cy.get('#starter-test1').click();
    cy.get('.step').should('have.length', 2);
    cy.get('.step').eq(0).should('contain', 'Human: Test 1');
    cy.get('.step').eq(1).should('contain', 'Assistant: Test 1');
  });
});
```

This test suite demonstrates how to interact with the Chainlit application's starter feature and verify its behavior using Cypress commands and assertions.
