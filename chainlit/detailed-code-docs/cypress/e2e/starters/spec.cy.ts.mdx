title: "spec.cy.ts"

## High-level description
This Cypress test file (`spec.cy.ts`) contains a test suite for the "Starters" functionality. It sets up a test server and verifies that a user can interact with a starter, checking for the existence of specific elements and their content.

## Symbols

### `describe('Starters', () =&gt; {...})`
#### Description
This is the main test suite for the "Starters" functionality. It contains a setup step and a single test case.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up the test environment by running a test server before any tests are executed.
2. Defines a single test case to verify the functionality of using a starter.

### `before(() =&gt; {...})`
#### Description
This hook runs once before all tests in the suite. It sets up the test environment.

#### Internal Logic
Calls the `runTestServer()` function to start the test server.

### `it('should be able to use a starter', () =&gt; {...})`
#### Description
This test case verifies that a user can interact with a starter and checks for expected elements and content.

#### Internal Logic
1. Waits for 1 second to ensure the page is loaded.
2. Finds and clicks an element with the ID 'starter-test1'.
3. Checks that there are exactly two elements with the class 'step'.
4. Verifies the content of both 'step' elements.

## Notes on Related Code
The related file `testUtils.ts` contains utility functions for Cypress tests, including `runTestServer()`. This function is used in the `before` hook of the test suite to set up the test environment. It takes an optional `ExecutionMode` parameter and an optional environment variables object. The function determines the test name from the current spec file path and executes a command to run a TypeScript file that presumably starts the test server.

While not directly used in this test file, `testUtils.ts` also provides other utility functions that might be useful in other Cypress tests, such as `submitMessage()`, `submitMessageCopilot()`, `openHistory()`, `closeHistory()`, and `describeSyncAsync()`.
