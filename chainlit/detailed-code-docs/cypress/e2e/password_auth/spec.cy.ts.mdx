## High-level description
This Cypress test suite, located in `cypress/e2e/password_auth/spec.cy.ts`, focuses on testing the password authentication functionality of a web application. It includes tests for both failed and successful login attempts, as well as verifying the persistence of a user's session after a page reload.

## Code Structure
The test suite consists of a single `describe` block containing two test cases (`it` blocks). It uses the `runTestServer` function from a utility file to set up the test environment.

## References
- `runTestServer` function from `../../support/testUtils`

### `describe('Password Auth', ...)`
#### Description
This is the main test suite for password authentication. It sets up the test environment and contains individual test cases.

#### Internal Logic
1. Before running the tests, it calls `runTestServer()` to set up the test environment.
2. Contains two test cases for failed and successful login attempts.

### `it('should fail to login with wrong credentials', ...)`
#### Description
This test case verifies that the login process fails when incorrect credentials are provided.

#### Internal Logic
1. Enters incorrect email and password into the login form.
2. Submits the form.
3. Checks for the presence of an error message.

### `it('should be able to login with correct credentials', ...)`
#### Description
This test case verifies successful login with correct credentials and checks if the session persists after a page reload.

#### Internal Logic
1. Visits the root page ('/').
2. Enters correct email and password into the login form.
3. Submits the form.
4. Verifies that the user is logged in by checking for a welcome message.
5. Reloads the page.
6. Confirms that the login form is not present and the user is still logged in.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Cypress | End-to-end testing framework used for writing and running the tests |

## Configuration
The test suite uses the default Cypress configuration. No specific configuration options are defined in this file.

## Error Handling
Error handling is implicit in the Cypress assertions. If any of the assertions fail, Cypress will mark the test as failed and provide detailed error information.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in this code.
