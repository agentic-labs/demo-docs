## High-level description
This code implements a simple password authentication system and a chat start handler using the Chainlit framework. It defines an authentication callback function and a chat start event handler that greets the authenticated user.

## Symbols

### `auth_callback`
#### Description
This function is a password authentication callback decorated with `@cl.password_auth_callback`. It checks if the provided username and password match a hardcoded set of credentials.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| username | str | The username provided by the user |
| password | str | The password provided by the user |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| return | Optional[cl.User] | A User object if authentication is successful, None otherwise |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the provided username and password match the hardcoded credentials ("admin", "admin").
2. If the credentials match, it returns a `cl.User` object with the identifier "admin".
3. If the credentials don't match, it returns `None`.

### `on_chat_start`
#### Description
This asynchronous function is an event handler for the chat start event, decorated with `@cl.on_chat_start`. It retrieves the authenticated user and sends a greeting message.

#### Inputs
This function doesn't take any explicit inputs.

#### Outputs
This function doesn't return any value.

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the authenticated user from the `cl.user_session`.
2. Creates a `cl.Message` object with a greeting that includes the user's identifier.
3. Sends the greeting message asynchronously.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| chainlit | The main framework used for building the chat application |
| typing | Used for type hinting (Optional) |

## Error Handling
This code doesn't implement any explicit error handling. It relies on the default error handling provided by the Chainlit framework.

## Security Considerations
1. The authentication mechanism uses hardcoded credentials ("admin", "admin"), which is not secure for production use. In a real-world application, this should be replaced with a more robust authentication system.
2. The code doesn't implement any rate limiting or protection against brute-force attacks on the authentication system.

## TODOs
1. Replace the hardcoded credentials with a secure authentication mechanism.
2. Implement proper error handling for authentication failures.
3. Consider adding logging for authentication attempts and successful logins.
4. Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks on the authentication system.
