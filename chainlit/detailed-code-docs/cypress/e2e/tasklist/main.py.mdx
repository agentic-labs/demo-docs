## High-level description
This code implements a Chainlit-based chat application that simulates a task execution process. It creates and manages a task list, updating task statuses over time to demonstrate the progression of tasks from initialization to completion or failure.

## Code Structure
The code is structured around Chainlit's event-driven model, using `@cl.on_chat_start` and `@cl.on_message` decorators to define behavior at different stages of the chat interaction. The main functionality is implemented in the `main()` function, which creates and updates a task list.

## Symbols

### `fake_tasks`
#### Description
A list of strings representing various fake tasks that will be used to populate the task list.

### `task_list`
#### Description
A global variable to store the `cl.TaskList` object. While noted as not a good practice for normal Chainlit servers due to its global nature, it's used here for testing scenarios with a single user.

### `on_message()`
#### Description
An asynchronous function decorated with `@cl.on_message` that removes the task list when a message is received.

#### Internal Logic
1. Waits for a message to be received.
2. Removes the task list using `await task_list.remove()`.

### `main()`
#### Description
The main asynchronous function decorated with `@cl.on_chat_start` that initializes and manages the task list.

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes a new `cl.TaskList()`.
2. Sets the task list status to "Running...".
3. Adds 17 tasks from the `fake_tasks` list to the task list.
4. Sends the task list to the chat.
5. Sets the status of the first task to RUNNING.
6. Updates the status of the first 10 tasks sequentially (9 to DONE, 1 to RUNNING).
7. Sets the status of the 10th task to FAILED.

## Side Effects
- Modifies the global `task_list` variable.
- Sends updates to the Chainlit chat interface.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| chainlit | Used for creating and managing the chat interface and task list |

## Error Handling
The code does not implement explicit error handling mechanisms beyond what's provided by Chainlit.

## TODOs
- The comment "Not a good practice in a normal chainlit server as it's global to all users" suggests that the use of a global `task_list` variable should be reconsidered for production environments.
