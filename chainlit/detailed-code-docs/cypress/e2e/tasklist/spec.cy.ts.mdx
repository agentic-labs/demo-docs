## High-level description
This Cypress test suite verifies the functionality and appearance of a tasklist component in a web application. It checks the visibility, count, and status of tasks in both desktop and mobile views, and ensures the tasklist disappears after submitting a message.

## Symbols

### `describe('tasklist', () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
This is the main test suite for the tasklist functionality. It sets up the test environment and contains a single test case.

#### Internal Logic
1. Runs a test server before executing the tests.
2. Defines a test case to check the tasklist display and behavior.

### `before(() =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
This hook runs before all tests in the suite, setting up the test environment.

#### Internal Logic
Calls the `runTestServer()` function to start the test server.

### `it('should display the tasklist ', () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
This test case verifies the correct display and behavior of the tasklist component.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks that there are no step elements initially.
2. Verifies the presence of two tasklist elements.
3. Checks that the mobile tasklist is not visible.
4. Verifies that the desktop tasklist is visible and contains 17 tasks.
5. Checks the count of tasks with different statuses (ready, running, failed, done).
6. Submits a message with "ok".
7. Verifies that the tasklist no longer exists after submitting the message.

## Dependencies

| @cypress/support/testUtils | Custom utility functions for testing |

## References
The test file references the following functions from the `testUtils` module:
- `runTestServer()`: Starts the test server for the specific test.
- `submitMessage(message: string)`: Submits a message in the chat input.

## Notes
1. The test assumes a specific structure and behavior of the tasklist component, including desktop and mobile versions.
2. The test checks for specific counts of tasks in different statuses, which may need to be updated if the expected task counts change.
3. The test uses a 1000ms wait before submitting a message, which may need adjustment based on the application's performance.
