## High-level description
This directory contains files related to testing and configuring a task list feature in a Chainlit-based chat application. It includes a Cypress end-to-end test specification, a Python implementation of the task list functionality, and a Chainlit configuration file.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory implements and tests a task list feature for a chatbot application. The main functionality simulates the creation and progression of tasks, updating their statuses over time. The test suite verifies that the task list is displayed correctly in both desktop and mobile views, checks the count and status of tasks, and ensures the task list disappears after user interaction. The configuration file sets up various aspects of the Chainlit application, including UI customization and feature toggles.

## Key Files

1. `main.py`:
   This file contains the core implementation of the task list feature using Chainlit. It defines a list of fake tasks and implements functions to create, update, and manage these tasks within a chat interface. The main function simulates the progression of tasks from initialization to completion or failure.

2. `spec.cy.ts`:
   This Cypress test specification file verifies the functionality and appearance of the task list component. It checks for the correct display of tasks in both desktop and mobile views, verifies task counts and statuses, and ensures the task list behaves correctly when a user submits a message.

3. `.chainlit`:
   This TOML configuration file sets up various aspects of the Chainlit application, including project-wide settings, feature toggles, and UI customization options.

## Dependencies
- Chainlit: Used for creating and managing the chat interface and task list functionality.
- Cypress: Employed for end-to-end testing of the task list component.

## Configuration
The `.chainlit` file contains various configuration options, including:

- Project settings: Telemetry, session timeout, caching, and CORS settings.
- Feature toggles: Prompt playground, HTML rendering, LaTeX rendering, and file upload.
- UI customization: Chatbot name, content collapse settings, and theme colors.

Key configuration options include:

```toml
[project]
enable_telemetry = true
session_timeout = 3600
cache = false
allow_origins = ["*"]

[features]
prompt_playground = true
unsafe_allow_html = false
latex = false

[UI]
name = "Chatbot"
show_readme_as_default = true
default_collapse_content = true
default_expand_messages = false
```

These settings control various aspects of the Chainlit application's behavior and appearance.

The implementation in `main.py` uses a global `task_list` variable, which is noted as not being a good practice for normal Chainlit servers due to its global nature. This approach is used here specifically for testing scenarios with a single user but should be reconsidered for production environments.

The Cypress test in `spec.cy.ts` assumes a specific structure and behavior of the task list component, including the presence of both desktop and mobile versions. It checks for specific counts of tasks in different statuses, which may need to be updated if the expected task counts change in the future.
