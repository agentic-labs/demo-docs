## High-level description
This directory contains files related to testing and configuring a Chainlit application that displays a Matplotlib chart. It includes a Python script for generating and sending the chart, a Cypress test file for verifying the chart's display, and a Chainlit configuration file.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory sets up a simple chatbot application that generates and displays a line chart when a chat session starts. It also includes a test to ensure that the chart is displayed correctly in the user interface. The configuration file provides settings for the Chainlit project, including UI customization and feature toggles.

Here's a breakdown of the workflow:
1. When a user starts a chat session, the Python script creates a Matplotlib line plot.
2. The plot is wrapped in a Chainlit Pyplot element and sent as a message to the chat interface.
3. The Cypress test verifies that the chart appears correctly as an inline image within a step in the UI.

## Key Files

### main.py
This is the core Python script that generates and sends the Matplotlib chart. It defines an asynchronous function `start` that runs when a chat session begins. The function creates a simple line plot using Matplotlib, wraps it in a Chainlit Pyplot element, and sends it as a message to the chat interface.

### spec.cy.ts
This Cypress test file verifies the functionality of displaying the inline chart. It sets up a test environment using a helper function `runTestServer()` and checks for the presence of a single step containing an inline image, which represents the chart.

### .chainlit
This TOML configuration file defines various settings for the Chainlit project, including telemetry, session management, and UI customization options. It enables features like the prompt playground and sets default behaviors for content display.

## Dependencies
- Matplotlib: Used for creating the line plot in `main.py`.
- Chainlit: The main framework for building the conversational AI interface.
- Cypress: The end-to-end testing framework used in `spec.cy.ts`.

## Configuration
The `.chainlit` file contains the following key configurations:
- Telemetry is enabled by default.
- Session timeout is set to 3600 seconds (1 hour).
- Caching is disabled.
- The prompt playground feature is enabled.
- The app and chatbot are named "Chatbot".
- Large content is collapsed by default.
- Chain of thought details are visible in the UI.

Additional UI theme customization options are available but commented out in the configuration file.
