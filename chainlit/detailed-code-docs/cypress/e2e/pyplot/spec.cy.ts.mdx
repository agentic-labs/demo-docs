## High-level description
This Cypress test suite verifies the functionality of displaying an inline chart in a pyplot component. It sets up a test server and checks for the presence of a single step containing an inline image.

## Code Structure
The test file contains a single describe block with one test case. It utilizes a helper function `runTestServer()` from a separate utility file to set up the test environment.

## References
- `runTestServer()` function from '../../support/testUtils'

## Symbols

### `describe('pyplot', ...)`
#### Description
This is the main test suite for the pyplot functionality. It sets up the test environment and contains individual test cases.

#### Internal Logic
1. Before running any tests, it calls `runTestServer()` to set up the test environment.
2. Contains a single test case to check for the presence of an inline chart.

### `it('should be able to display an inline chart', ...)`
#### Description
This test case verifies that an inline chart is displayed correctly within a step.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks that there is exactly one element with the class 'step'.
2. Verifies that the first (and only) step contains an element with the class 'inline-image'.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Cypress | End-to-end testing framework used for writing and running the tests |

## Error Handling
This test file does not implement explicit error handling. Cypress will automatically fail the test if any of the assertions do not pass.

### `runTestServer()`
#### Description
This function is imported from '../../support/testUtils' and is used to set up the test environment before running the tests.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mode | ExecutionMode (optional) | Specifies the execution mode for the test server |
| env | Record&lt;string, string&gt; (optional) | Environment variables to be passed to the test server |

#### Internal Logic
1. Determines the test name from the current spec file path.
2. Executes a command to run the test server using ts-node.
3. Visits the root URL ('/') after starting the server.

This related function is crucial for setting up the test environment, ensuring that the application is running and accessible for the Cypress tests to interact with it.
