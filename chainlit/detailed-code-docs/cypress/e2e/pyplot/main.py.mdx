## High-level description
This code demonstrates how to create and send a message with an embedded Matplotlib chart using the Chainlit library. It defines an asynchronous function that generates a simple line plot and sends it as part of a message when a chat session starts.

## Symbols

### `start`
#### Description
This asynchronous function is decorated with `@cl.on_chat_start`, indicating it runs when a chat session begins. It creates a Matplotlib figure with a simple line plot, wraps it in a Chainlit Pyplot element, and sends a message containing the chart.

#### Inputs
This function doesn't take any explicit inputs.

#### Outputs
This function doesn't return any values, but it sends a message using Chainlit's API.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a Matplotlib figure and axis objects.
2. Plots a simple line graph using `ax.plot()`.
3. Wraps the figure in a Chainlit Pyplot element.
4. Creates a Chainlit Message with text content and the chart element.
5. Sends the message asynchronously.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| matplotlib.pyplot | For creating and manipulating plots |
| chainlit | For building conversational AI interfaces |

## Side Effects
- Sends a message with an embedded chart to the Chainlit chat interface when a chat session starts.

## Performance Considerations
The plot generation is relatively simple and should be quick to execute. However, for more complex plots or larger datasets, consider the potential impact on chat start-up time.

## Notes
This code is likely part of a larger Chainlit application. The `@cl.on_chat_start` decorator suggests that there may be other event handlers or components in the full application that are not shown in this file.
