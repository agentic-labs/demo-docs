## High-level description
This Cypress test suite verifies the functionality of removing elements in a web application. It sets up a test server and checks if specific elements can be removed from the DOM.

## Symbols

### `describe('remove_elements', ...)`
#### Description
This is the main test suite for the 'remove_elements' functionality. It sets up the test environment and contains individual test cases.

#### Internal Logic
1. Before running the tests, it calls `runTestServer()` to set up the test environment.
2. Contains a single test case for removing elements.

### `it('should be able to remove elements', ...)`
#### Description
This test case verifies the ability to remove elements from the DOM.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the element with ID 'step-tool1' exists.
2. Clicks on the 'step-tool1' element.
3. Verifies that the parent of 'step-tool1' contains one '.inline-image' element.
4. Checks if there are two '.step' elements.
5. Verifies that the second '.step' element contains one '.inline-image' element.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @cypress/e2e | Cypress end-to-end testing framework |
| ../../support/testUtils | Custom utility functions for testing |

## References
- `runTestServer()`: This function is imported from '../../support/testUtils' and is used to set up the test environment.

## Notes
1. The test assumes that the application has elements with specific IDs and classes ('step-tool1', '.step', '.inline-image').
2. The test doesn't actually remove elements but rather checks for their existence and count after certain actions.
3. The test uses Cypress commands like `cy.get()`, `cy.click()`, and assertions like `should('exist')` and `should('have.length', ...)`.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code, but potential improvements could include:
1. Adding more test cases to cover different scenarios of element removal.
2. Implementing actual element removal and verifying that the removed elements no longer exist in the DOM.
3. Adding error handling or timeout management for asynchronous operations.
