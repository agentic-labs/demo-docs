## High-level description
This directory contains a Cypress end-to-end test suite for a Chainlit-based chat application. The suite focuses on testing the functionality of removing image elements from both messages and steps in the chat interface. The directory includes configuration files, a Python script demonstrating the Chainlit application, and a Cypress test specification.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory sets up and tests a chat application that can display and manipulate images within chat messages and steps. Here's a breakdown of the workflow:

1. The Chainlit application (main.py) creates a chat interface where:
   - It adds images to both messages and steps.
   - It then demonstrates the ability to remove specific images from these elements.

2. The Cypress test (spec.cy.ts) verifies this functionality by:
   - Setting up a test server.
   - Checking for the presence of specific elements in the DOM.
   - Verifying that certain elements contain the expected number of images after interactions.

This setup allows developers to ensure that the image manipulation features of the chat application work correctly, particularly the ability to remove images from chat elements.

## Key Files

1. main.py
   - This is the core application file written in Python using the Chainlit framework.
   - It defines an asynchronous `start()` function that runs at the beginning of each chat session.
   - The function creates messages and steps with images, then demonstrates how to remove specific images from both.

2. spec.cy.ts
   - This is the Cypress test specification file written in TypeScript.
   - It contains a test suite that verifies the functionality of removing elements in the web application.
   - The test checks for the presence of specific elements and their image content after certain interactions.

3. .chainlit
   - This is a TOML configuration file for the Chainlit project.
   - It defines various settings for the project, including telemetry, session management, and UI customization options.

## Dependencies
The project relies on the following main dependencies:

1. Chainlit
   - Version: Not specified in the provided files
   - Purpose: Used for creating and managing the chat interface, including steps, messages, and image elements.

2. Cypress
   - Version: Not specified in the provided files
   - Purpose: Used for end-to-end testing of the web application.

## Configuration
The .chainlit file contains various configuration options for the Chainlit project:

1. Project Settings:
   - Telemetry is enabled by default
   - Session timeout is set to 3600 seconds (1 hour)
   - Caching is disabled

2. Features:
   - The prompt playground feature is enabled

3. UI Settings:
   - The app and chatbot name is set to "Chatbot"
   - Large size content is collapsed by default
   - Messages are not expanded by default
   - Chain of thought details are shown in the UI

Note: There are additional commented-out configuration options for UI theme customization and GitHub integration that are not currently active in this configuration.

In summary, this directory contains a small but focused set of files that work together to implement and test a specific feature of a Chainlit-based chat application: the ability to add and remove image elements from chat messages and steps. The Cypress test suite ensures that this functionality works as expected in the web interface.
