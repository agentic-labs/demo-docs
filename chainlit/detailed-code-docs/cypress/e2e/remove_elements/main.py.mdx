## High-level description
This code demonstrates the usage of Chainlit to create a chat application with image elements. It showcases how to add and remove images from both steps and messages in a Chainlit chat interface.

## Symbols

### `start()`
#### Description
This asynchronous function is triggered at the start of a chat session. It creates and sends a message with images, and also creates a step with images. It then demonstrates how to remove specific images from both the message and the step.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates two `cl.Image` objects: `step_image` and `msg_image`, both pointing to the same image file.
2. Creates a step using `cl.Step` with two images: `step_image` and a new inline image.
3. Sends a message with two images: `msg_image` and a new inline image.
4. Removes `msg_image` from the sent message.
5. Removes `step_image` from the created step.

## Side Effects
- Sends a message to the chat interface.
- Creates a step in the chat interface.
- Modifies the content of the sent message and step by removing specific images.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| chainlit | Used for creating and managing the chat interface, including steps, messages, and image elements. |

## Error Handling
This code does not implement explicit error handling. It relies on Chainlit's built-in error handling mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference
| Decorator | Purpose |
|:----------|:--------|
| @cl.on_chat_start | Registers the `start()` function to be executed when a new chat session begins. |

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in this code.

Note: The code uses relative file paths for images (`../../fixtures/cat.jpeg`). Ensure that these paths are correct relative to the location where the script is run.
