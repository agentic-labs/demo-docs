## High-level description
This Cypress test suite, located in `cypress/e2e/data_layer/spec.cy.ts`, focuses on testing various data layer functionalities of a web application. It includes tests for user login, feedback submission, thread management, and thread resumption, ensuring the persistence and proper functioning of these features.

## Code Structure
The code is structured into several helper functions (`login`, `feedback`, `threadQueue`, `threadList`, `resumeThread`) that encapsulate specific test scenarios. These functions are then used within a single test case in the main `describe` block.

## References
The code references functions from `../../support/testUtils`, specifically `runTestServer` and `submitMessage`.

## Symbols

### `login()`
#### Description
Simulates a user login process by entering credentials.

#### Internal Logic
1. Types 'admin' into the email input field.
2. Types 'admin' into the password input field and submits the form.

### `feedback()`
#### Description
Tests the feedback submission functionality and verifies the UI updates accordingly.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the current path is the root ('/').
2. Submits a message 'Hello'.
3. Verifies the path changes to a thread-specific URL.
4. Checks for the presence of feedback buttons.
5. Clicks the positive feedback button and submits the feedback.
6. Verifies the positive feedback button state changes.

### `threadQueue()`
#### Description
Verifies the correct display of step counters in the thread queue.

#### Internal Logic
Checks specific step elements for their content, ensuring the step counters are correct.

### `threadList()`
#### Description
Tests the thread list functionality, including thread display, navigation, and deletion.

#### Internal Logic
1. Verifies the presence of two test threads.
2. Clicks on a thread and checks its content.
3. Tests the thread deletion process.
4. Verifies the deleted thread is no longer visible.

### `resumeThread()`
#### Description
Tests the thread resumption functionality and verifies the correct display of resumed threads.

#### Internal Logic
1. Navigates to a specific thread and resumes it.
2. Verifies the chat input becomes available after resuming.
3. Checks that the URL remains unchanged after resuming.
4. Repeats the process for another thread.
5. Verifies the correct number and content of steps in the resumed thread.

### `describe('Data Layer', ...)`
#### Description
The main test suite that runs all the data layer tests.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up the test server before running the tests.
2. Defines a single test case that sequentially calls all the helper functions to test various features.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| cypress | End-to-end testing framework |
| ../../support/testUtils | Custom utility functions for testing |

## Error Handling
This test suite relies on Cypress's built-in error handling and assertion mechanisms. If any assertion fails, the test will fail and provide detailed error information.

## Performance Considerations
The test includes several `cy.wait()` calls (indirectly through the `submitMessage` function) to account for potential delays in the application's response. These waits might impact the overall test execution time but are necessary for test stability.
