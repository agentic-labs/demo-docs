## High-level description
This code defines a series of nested tool functions using the Chainlit library. It demonstrates how to create and execute steps in a workflow, with each tool potentially calling other tools and sending messages.

## Code Structure
The code defines three tool functions (`tool_1`, `tool_2`, and `tool_3`) that are nested within each other. The `main` function serves as the entry point, which is triggered on receiving a message.

## Symbols

### `tool_3()`
#### Description
This function represents the innermost tool in the nested structure. It creates a step named "tool3" of type "tool", simulates a delay, and sets the step's output.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a step named "tool3" using `cl.Step()`.
2. Simulates a 2-second delay using `cl.run_sync(cl.sleep(2))`.
3. Sets the step's output to "Response from tool 3".

### `tool_2()`
#### Description
This function represents the middle tool in the nested structure. It calls `tool_3()`, sends a message, and returns a response.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| return value | str | A string containing "Response from tool 2" |

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls `tool_3()`.
2. Sends a message with content "Message from tool 2" using `cl.Message()`.
3. Returns "Response from tool 2".

### `tool_1()`
#### Description
This function represents the outermost tool in the nested structure. It calls `tool_2()` and returns a response.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| return value | str | A string containing "Response from tool 1" |

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls `tool_2()`.
2. Returns "Response from tool 1".

### `main(message: cl.Message)`
#### Description
This is the main function that gets triggered when a message is received. It calls `tool_1()` to start the nested tool execution.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| message | cl.Message | The incoming message that triggers the function |

#### Internal Logic
Calls `tool_1()` to start the nested tool execution.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| chainlit | Used for creating steps, sending messages, and handling the message reception flow |

## Decorators
The code uses two types of decorators from the Chainlit library:

1. `@cl.step(name="tool2", type="tool")` and `@cl.step(name="tool1", type="tool")`: These decorators are used to define steps for `tool_2` and `tool_1` respectively, specifying their names and types.

2. `@cl.on_message`: This decorator is used on the `main` function to indicate that it should be triggered when a message is received.

## Asynchronous Programming
The code uses both synchronous and asynchronous programming:

1. `cl.run_sync()` is used to run synchronous operations (like `cl.sleep()` and `cl.Message().send()`) within the asynchronous context.
2. The `main` function is defined as `async`, allowing it to be used in an asynchronous event loop.

This structure allows for efficient handling of potentially time-consuming operations without blocking the entire application.
