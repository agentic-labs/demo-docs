## High-level description
This code demonstrates the use of Chainlit's asynchronous step functionality to create a chain of tool executions. It defines three tools that are called sequentially, with each tool potentially performing its own actions and returning responses.

## Code Structure
The code defines three asynchronous functions (`tool_1`, `tool_2`, and `tool_3`) representing different tools, and a main message handler. These functions are designed to be executed in a specific order, with `tool_1` calling `tool_2`, which in turn calls `tool_3`.

## Symbols

### `tool_3()`
#### Description
An asynchronous function that simulates a tool execution with a delay.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| s.output | str | A string response from the tool |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a Chainlit Step named "tool3" of type "tool".
2. Simulates work with a 2-second delay using `cl.sleep(2)`.
3. Sets the step's output to "Response from tool 3".

### `tool_2()`
#### Description
An asynchronous function decorated with `@cl.step` that calls `tool_3()` and sends a message.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| return value | str | A string response from the tool |

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls `tool_3()`.
2. Sends a message with content "Message from tool 2".
3. Returns "Response from tool 2".

### `tool_1()`
#### Description
An asynchronous function decorated with `@cl.step` that calls `tool_2()`.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| return value | str | A string response from the tool |

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls `tool_2()`.
2. Returns "Response from tool 1".

### `main(message: cl.Message)`
#### Description
The main message handler decorated with `@cl.on_message` that initiates the tool chain.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| message | cl.Message | The incoming message object |

#### Internal Logic
Calls `tool_1()` when a message is received.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| chainlit | Provides the framework for creating conversational AI applications |

## Error Handling
This code does not implement explicit error handling. Any exceptions raised during the execution of the tools will propagate up the call stack.

## Logging
The code uses Chainlit's built-in step functionality, which likely provides some form of logging or tracing of the tool executions. However, no explicit custom logging is implemented in this code.

## API/Interface Reference
While this code doesn't explicitly define an API, it does set up a message handler using Chainlit's `@cl.on_message` decorator. This handler responds to incoming messages by executing a chain of tools.

| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| N/A | Message | Any incoming message | Chain of tool executions | Executes tool_1, which triggers tool_2 and tool_3 |
