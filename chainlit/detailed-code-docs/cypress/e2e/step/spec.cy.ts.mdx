## High-level description
This Cypress test file (`spec.cy.ts`) defines a test suite for the "Step" functionality. It verifies the ability to nest steps within the application by interacting with step tools and checking the resulting step structure.

## Code Structure
The test suite uses utility functions imported from `testUtils.ts` to set up the test environment and perform common actions. It contains a single test case that interacts with step tools and verifies the resulting step structure.

## References
- `../../support/testUtils`: Imports utility functions for test setup and interaction.

## Symbols

### `describeSyncAsync('Step', () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
This function creates a test suite for the "Step" functionality, running the tests in both synchronous and asynchronous execution modes.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up the test environment by running the test server before the tests.
2. Defines a single test case to verify the nesting of steps.

### `it('should be able to nest steps', () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
This test case verifies the ability to nest steps within the application.

#### Internal Logic
1. Submits a message "Hello" using the `submitMessage` function.
2. Clicks on three step tools (#step-tool1, #step-tool2, #step-tool3) in sequence.
3. Verifies the existence of each step tool.
4. Checks that the total number of steps (.step elements) is 5.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Cypress | End-to-end testing framework |

## Error Handling
This test file relies on Cypress's built-in error handling and assertion mechanisms. If any of the assertions or actions fail, Cypress will report the failure and provide detailed information about the error.
