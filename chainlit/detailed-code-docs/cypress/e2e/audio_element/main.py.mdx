## High-level description
This code demonstrates how to use the Chainlit library to create a chat application that sends an audio message. It defines a single function that runs when a chat session starts, which sends a message containing an audio element.

## Symbols

### `start()`
#### Description
This asynchronous function is decorated with `@cl.on_chat_start`, indicating it runs when a new chat session begins. It creates an audio element and sends a message containing this element.

#### Inputs
This function takes no inputs.

#### Outputs
This function has no explicit return value, but it sends a message with an audio element.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a list `elements` containing a single `cl.Audio` object.
2. Uses `cl.Message` to create a message with the text "This message has an audio" and the audio element.
3. Sends the message asynchronously using the `send()` method.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| chainlit | Used for creating the chat application and handling audio elements |

## Code Structure
The code consists of a single function `start()` that is triggered at the beginning of a chat session. It utilizes the Chainlit library to create and send a message with an audio element.

## References
The code references the following Chainlit components:
- `cl.on_chat_start`: A decorator to specify the function to run when a chat starts.
- `cl.Audio`: A class to create an audio element.
- `cl.Message`: A class to create a message that can include elements like audio.

## Side Effects
The function sends a message to the chat interface, which is a side effect that affects the user's chat experience.

## Configuration
The audio file is configured with the following parameters:
| Option | Type | Value | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------|:------------|
| name | str | "example.mp3" | The name of the audio file |
| path | str | "../../fixtures/example.mp3" | The relative path to the audio file |
| display | str | "inline" | How the audio element should be displayed |

Note: The path suggests that the audio file is located in a "fixtures" directory two levels up from the current file's location.

This code provides a simple example of how to integrate audio elements into a Chainlit chat application, demonstrating the library's capability to handle multimedia content in chat messages.
