## High-level description
This Cypress test suite verifies the functionality of an audio element within a web application. It ensures that the audio element is correctly displayed and can be played, focusing on the presence and playability of the audio content.

## Code Structure
The test file contains a single describe block with one test case. It utilizes a helper function `runTestServer()` from a separate utility file to set up the test environment.

## References
- `runTestServer()` function from '../../support/testUtils'

## Symbols

### `describe('audio', ...)`
#### Description
This is the main test suite for the audio functionality. It sets up the test environment and contains the individual test case.

#### Internal Logic
1. Before running the tests, it calls `runTestServer()` to set up the test environment.
2. Contains one test case to verify the audio element's presence and playability.

### `it('should be able to display an audio element', ...)`
#### Description
This test case verifies that an audio element is present on the page and can be played.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks for the presence of a single `.step` element.
2. Verifies that the first `.step` element contains an `.inline-audio` element.
3. Finds the `audio` element within `.inline-audio`.
4. Attempts to play the audio and retrieves its duration.
5. Asserts that the audio duration is greater than 0, indicating successful playback.

## Error Handling
The test relies on Cypress's built-in error handling and assertion mechanisms. If any of the assertions fail, the test will fail and provide detailed error information.

## Related Code
The `runTestServer()` function is imported from '../../support/testUtils'. This function is responsible for setting up the test environment before running the tests. It appears to:

1. Determine the test name from the current spec file path.
2. Execute a TypeScript file using `ts-node` to set up the test server.
3. Navigate to the root URL of the application under test.

The `runTestServer()` function can optionally take an `ExecutionMode` parameter and an environment variables object, allowing for flexible test setup configurations.
