title: "spec.cy.ts"

## High-level description
This Cypress test file (`spec.cy.ts`) focuses on testing the streaming functionality of a chat-like application. It verifies that messages and tool calls are streamed correctly, with tokens appearing sequentially and the full message being displayed at the end.

## Code Structure
The file contains helper functions `messageStream` and `toolStream` that are used within the main test case. The test case is defined using Cypress's `describe` and `it` blocks, with a `before` hook to set up the test environment.

## Symbols

### `messageStream`
#### Description
This function checks if a message is streamed correctly at a specific index in the chat.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| index | number | The index of the message step to check |

#### Internal Logic
1. Iterates through each token in `tokenList`.
2. Checks if each token appears in the message step.
3. Verifies that the full message (all tokens joined) appears in the step.

### `toolStream`
#### Description
This function checks if a tool call is streamed correctly.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| tool | string | The identifier of the tool being called |

#### Internal Logic
1. Finds the tool call element and clicks it.
2. Iterates through each token in `tokenList`.
3. Checks if each token appears in the tool call's parent element.
4. Verifies that the full message (all tokens joined) appears in the parent element.

### `describe('Streaming', ...)`
#### Description
This is the main test suite for streaming functionality.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up the test environment using `runTestServer()` in the `before` hook.
2. Defines a test case using `it(...)` that:
   - Checks initial step count
   - Tests message streaming twice
   - Tests tool streaming once
   - Verifies step count after each operation

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| cypress | Testing framework used for end-to-end testing |
| ../../support/testUtils | Imports `runTestServer` function for setting up the test environment |

## References
- The `runTestServer` function is imported from `../../support/testUtils`.
- The `runTestServer` function is defined in the related `cypress/support/testUtils.ts` file and is used to set up the test environment before running the tests.

## Notes
1. The test assumes a specific structure in the DOM, with elements having classes like `.step` and IDs like `#step-tool1`.
2. The `tokenList` is predefined and used for both message and tool streaming tests.
3. The test checks for the correct number of steps after each streaming operation, ensuring that new steps are added as expected.
4. The test uses Cypress commands like `cy.get()`, `should()`, and `click()` to interact with and assert on the DOM elements.

This test file provides a comprehensive check of the streaming functionality, ensuring that both messages and tool calls are displayed correctly and in the expected order.
