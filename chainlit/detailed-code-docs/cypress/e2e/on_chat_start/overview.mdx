## High-level description
This directory contains files related to the implementation and testing of the `on_chat_start` functionality for a chatbot application using the Chainlit library. It includes a configuration file, a Python script for the chatbot logic, and a Cypress test file for verifying the functionality.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory sets up a simple chatbot that sends a welcome message with a code snippet when a new chat session starts. The welcome message demonstrates how to use the Chainlit library to create a chatbot. The functionality is then tested using Cypress to ensure that the initial message is displayed correctly when a user starts a chat session.

## Key Files

1. `.chainlit` (Configuration file):
   - Defines project settings, feature toggles, and UI customization options for the Chainlit application.
   - Configures telemetry, session management, and caching settings.
   - Sets up the chatbot's name and default UI behavior.

2. `main.py` (Chatbot logic):
   - Implements the core functionality of the chatbot using the Chainlit library.
   - Defines an asynchronous function `start()` that sends a welcome message when a new chat session begins.
   - The welcome message includes a greeting and a Python code snippet demonstrating Chainlit usage.

3. `spec.cy.ts` (Cypress test file):
   - Contains a test suite for verifying the `on_chat_start` functionality.
   - Sets up the test environment using a `runTestServer()` function.
   - Includes a test case that checks if the initial welcome message is displayed correctly.

## Dependencies
The main dependency for this project is the Chainlit library, which is used to create the chatbot interface and handle chat interactions. The version of Chainlit used is not explicitly specified in the provided files.

For testing, the project uses Cypress, a popular end-to-end testing framework for web applications.

## Configuration
The `.chainlit` file contains various configuration options for the project:

1. Project settings:
   - `enable_telemetry`: Set to `true` by default
   - `user_env`: An empty list for user environment variables
   - `session_timeout`: Set to 3600 seconds (1 hour)
   - `cache`: Set to `false` for third-party services

2. Feature toggles:
   - `prompt_playground`: Enabled by default

3. UI customization:
   - `name`: Set to "Chatbot" for both the app and chatbot
   - `default_collapse_content`: Set to `true`
   - `default_expand_messages`: Set to `false`
   - `hide_cot`: Set to `false`

Additional UI theme customization options are available but commented out in the configuration file.

The code in this directory demonstrates a simple implementation of a chatbot using Chainlit, focusing on the initial interaction when a chat session starts. The Cypress test ensures that this functionality works as expected, providing a basic but effective testing setup for the chatbot's welcome message feature.
