## High-level description
This code demonstrates the usage of the Chainlit library to create an asynchronous message handling system. It defines a message handler that sends two sequential messages with a 1-second delay between them when a new message is received.

## Symbols

### `message`
#### Description
This asynchronous function is a message handler decorated with `@cl.on_message`. It is triggered when a new message is received and sends two sequential messages with a delay between them.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| message | cl.Message | The incoming message object |

#### Outputs
This function doesn't return any value explicitly, but it sends two messages as side effects.

#### Internal Logic
1. Send the first message with content "Message 1" asynchronously.
2. Wait for 1 second using `cl.sleep()`.
3. Send the second message with content "Message 2" asynchronously.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| chainlit | Provides the framework for building conversational AI applications |

## Side Effects
- Sends two messages to the chat interface.
- Introduces a 1-second delay between messages.

## References
The code references the following Chainlit components:
- `cl.on_message`: A decorator for registering message handlers.
- `cl.Message`: A class for creating and sending messages.
- `cl.sleep`: A function for introducing delays in asynchronous code.

## Notes
1. This code is designed to work within a Chainlit application, which is typically used for creating conversational AI interfaces.
2. The asynchronous nature of the code allows for non-blocking execution, which is particularly useful when dealing with potential delays or I/O operations.
3. The 1-second delay between messages is likely for demonstration purposes or to simulate a more natural conversation flow.
4. The code doesn't process the content of the incoming message; it simply responds with two predefined messages regardless of the input.
