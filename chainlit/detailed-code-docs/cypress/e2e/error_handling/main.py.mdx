### `main()`
#### Description
This function is a Chainlit event handler for the chat start event. It deliberately raises an exception to simulate an error condition.

#### Inputs

#### Outputs
This function does not return any outputs. Instead, it raises an exception.

#### Internal Logic
The function's sole purpose is to raise an `Exception` with the message "This is an error message".

## Error Handling
This code is specifically designed to demonstrate error handling. It intentionally raises an exception using the following line:
```python
raise Exception("This is an error message")
```
This will trigger Chainlit's error handling mechanisms, allowing developers to observe how errors are managed and displayed in a Chainlit application.
