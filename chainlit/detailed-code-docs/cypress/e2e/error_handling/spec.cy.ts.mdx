title: "spec.cy.ts"

## High-level description
This Cypress test file (`spec.cy.ts`) focuses on error handling in the application. It sets up a test environment and verifies that error messages are correctly displayed on the page.

## Code Structure
The test file contains a single describe block with one test case. It uses a utility function `runTestServer()` to set up the test environment before running the test.

## References
- `runTestServer()` function from `../../support/testUtils`

## Symbols

### `describe('Error Handling', ...)`
#### Description
This is the main test suite for error handling. It sets up the test environment and contains a single test case.

#### Internal Logic
1. Before running the test, it calls `runTestServer()` to set up the test environment.
2. Contains one test case to check error message display.

### `it('should correctly display errors', ...)`
#### Description
This test case verifies that error messages are correctly displayed on the page.

#### Internal Logic
1. Selects elements with the class '.step'.
2. Asserts that there is exactly one such element.
3. Checks if the first (and only) element contains the text "This is an error message".

## Error Handling
This test specifically focuses on error handling, verifying that error messages are correctly displayed to the user.

## Performance Considerations
The test includes a specific assertion for the number of elements (`.should('have.length', 1)`), which helps ensure that the page structure is as expected and may prevent unnecessary iterations if multiple elements were unexpectedly present.

## Notes on Related Code
The `runTestServer()` function imported from `testUtils.ts` appears to be a utility for setting up the test environment. It seems to:

1. Determine the test name from the current spec file path.
2. Execute a TypeScript file (`run.ts`) with the test name and execution mode as arguments.
3. Navigate to the root URL of the application under test.

This setup allows for consistent test environment initialization across different test files.
