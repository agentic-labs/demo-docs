## High-level description
This directory contains files related to error handling testing in a Chainlit application using Cypress. It includes a configuration file, a Python script that intentionally raises an error, and a Cypress test specification file to verify the error handling behavior.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory sets up a test environment to demonstrate and verify error handling in a Chainlit application. Here's a breakdown of the workflow:

1. The `.chainlit` file configures the Chainlit project, setting up various options like telemetry, session management, and UI customization.

2. The `main.py` file contains a simple Chainlit event handler that intentionally raises an exception when the chat starts. This simulates an error condition in the application.

3. The `spec.cy.ts` file is a Cypress test that sets up the test environment, runs the application, and verifies that the error message is correctly displayed on the page.

Together, these files create a controlled environment to test how the application handles and displays errors, ensuring that error messages are properly communicated to the user.

## Key Files

1. `.chainlit`: This TOML configuration file sets up the Chainlit project with specific settings for telemetry, user environment, session management, caching, and UI customization.

2. `main.py`: This Python script contains a Chainlit event handler that intentionally raises an exception during the chat start event. Its purpose is to simulate an error condition in the application.

3. `spec.cy.ts`: This TypeScript file contains the Cypress test specification. It sets up the test environment, runs the application, and verifies that the error message is correctly displayed on the page.

## Dependencies
The main dependencies used in this directory are:

1. Chainlit: A framework for building conversational AI applications. It's used to create the chat application and handle events.

2. Cypress: An end-to-end testing framework used for writing and running the tests. It's used in the `spec.cy.ts` file to automate the testing process.

## Configuration
The `.chainlit` file contains various configuration options for the Chainlit project. Some key configurations include:

- `enable_telemetry`: Set to `true`, enabling telemetry for the project.
- `session_timeout`: Set to 3600 seconds (1 hour), determining how long the session is saved when the connection is lost.
- `cache`: Set to `false`, disabling third-party caching.
- `prompt_playground`: Set to `true`, enabling the prompt playground feature.
- `name`: Set to "Chatbot", defining the name of the app and chatbot.
- `default_collapse_content`: Set to `true`, collapsing large size content by default.
- `default_expand_messages`: Set to `false`, setting the default value for expand messages settings.

These configurations help set up the Chainlit environment for testing the error handling capabilities of the application.

The error handling test is implemented in the `spec.cy.ts` file, which uses Cypress to automate the testing process. The test verifies that when an error occurs (simulated by the `main.py` script), the error message "This is an error message" is correctly displayed on the page.

This setup allows developers to ensure that their Chainlit application properly handles and displays errors, providing a better user experience and easier debugging process.
