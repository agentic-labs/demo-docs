## High-level description
This directory contains files related to a Chainlit chat application that focuses on file upload functionality and its corresponding Cypress end-to-end test. The application allows users to upload text and Python files, processes them, and provides feedback. The test suite verifies this functionality by simulating file uploads and checking the application's responses.

## What does it do?
The main application prompts users to upload two files sequentially: first a text file, then a Python file. After each upload, it reads the file contents and sends a message back to the user with information about the uploaded file. This demonstrates the application's ability to handle file uploads and process different file types.

The Cypress test suite simulates this user interaction by programmatically uploading files and verifying the application's responses. It tests successful uploads of supported file types (text and Python) and also checks that unsupported file types (like C++) are rejected.

## Key Files
1. `main.py`: This is the core application file that implements the Chainlit chat interface and file upload functionality.
2. `spec.cy.ts`: This Cypress test file contains the end-to-end tests for the file upload feature.
3. `.chainlit`: This TOML configuration file sets up various options for the Chainlit project, including UI customization and feature toggles.

## Dependencies
1. Chainlit: Used for creating the chat interface and handling user interactions. The exact version is not specified in the provided files.
2. aiofiles: Used for asynchronous file I/O operations in `main.py`. The version is not specified.
3. Cypress: Used as the end-to-end testing framework in `spec.cy.ts`. The version is not specified in the provided files.

## Configuration
The `.chainlit` file contains various configuration options for the Chainlit project:

1. Telemetry is enabled by default.
2. Session timeout is set to 3600 seconds (1 hour).
3. Caching is disabled.
4. The prompt playground feature is enabled.
5. The app and chatbot name is set to "Chatbot".
6. Large content is collapsed by default, and messages are not expanded by default.

Here's a snippet of some key configuration options:

```toml
[project]
enable_telemetry = true
session_timeout = 3600
cache = false

[features]
prompt_playground = true

[UI]
name = "Chatbot"
default_collapse_content = true
default_expand_messages = false
```

The configuration file also includes commented-out sections for customizing light and dark themes, which can be uncommented and modified if needed.

In summary, this directory contains a simple yet functional file upload chat application with corresponding end-to-end tests, demonstrating how to implement and verify file handling capabilities in a Chainlit-based chat interface.
