## High-level description
This code implements a Chainlit chat application that prompts users to upload two files: a text file and a Python file. It then reads the contents of these files asynchronously and sends messages back to the user with information about the uploaded files.

## Symbols

### `start()`
#### Description
This asynchronous function is triggered at the start of a chat session. It handles the file upload process for both a text file and a Python file, reads their contents, and sends messages back to the user.

#### Inputs
This function doesn't take any explicit inputs, but it interacts with user inputs through the Chainlit interface.

#### Outputs
This function doesn't return any values, but it sends messages to the user through the Chainlit interface.

#### Internal Logic
1. Prompts the user to upload a text file using `cl.AskFileMessage`.
2. Reads the content of the uploaded text file asynchronously using `aiofiles`.
3. Sends a message to the user with information about the uploaded text file.
4. Prompts the user to upload a Python file using `cl.AskFileMessage`.
5. Reads the content of the uploaded Python file asynchronously using `aiofiles`.
6. Sends a message to the user with information about the uploaded Python file.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| aiofiles | Used for asynchronous file I/O operations |
| chainlit | Used for creating the chat interface and handling user interactions |

## Error Handling
This code doesn't implement explicit error handling. It assumes that file uploads and reads will be successful.

## Side Effects
The code interacts with the file system by reading the contents of uploaded files.

## Performance Considerations
The code uses asynchronous I/O operations (via `aiofiles` and `async/await` syntax) for file reading, which can help improve performance when dealing with I/O-bound operations.

## API/Interface Reference
| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| @cl.on_chat_start | N/A | N/A | N/A | Decorator that registers the `start()` function to be called when a chat session begins |

Note: The actual API endpoints are managed by the Chainlit framework, which this code utilizes for its chat functionality.
