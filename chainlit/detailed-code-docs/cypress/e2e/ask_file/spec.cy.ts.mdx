## High-level description
This Cypress test suite verifies the file upload functionality of a web application. It tests the ability to upload different types of files (text and Python) and checks the application's response to each upload, including the rejection of unsupported file types.

## Code Structure
The test suite consists of a single describe block with one test case. It uses Cypress commands to interact with the web page, upload files, and assert the expected behavior.

## References
- `runTestServer()` function from '../../support/testUtils'

## Symbols

### `describe('Upload file', ...)`
#### Description
This is the main test suite that encapsulates all the tests related to file uploading functionality.

#### Internal Logic
1. Runs the test server before executing the tests.
2. Contains a single test case for file upload functionality.

### `it('should be able to receive and decode files', ...)`
#### Description
This test case verifies the file upload functionality, including successful uploads of supported file types and rejection of unsupported types.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks for the existence of the upload button.
2. Uploads a text file and verifies the response.
3. Attempts to upload a C++ file (which should be rejected).
4. Uploads a Python file and verifies the response.
5. Checks that the upload button is no longer visible after successful uploads.

## Dependencies

| Cypress | End-to-end testing framework used for running the tests |

## Error Handling
The test implicitly handles errors through Cypress assertions. If any assertion fails, the test will fail and provide details about the failure.

## TODOs
There is a commented-out section that checks for a loading indicator. This suggests that there might be some timing issues with the file upload process that need to be addressed:

```typescript
// Sometimes the loading indicator is not shown because the file upload is too fast
// cy.get("#ask-upload-button-loading").should("exist");
// cy.get("#ask-upload-button-loading").should("not.exist");
```

This comment indicates that the loading indicator might not always be visible due to the speed of the file upload process. It may be worth investigating this behavior to ensure consistent testing across different environments or network conditions.
