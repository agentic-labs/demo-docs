## High-level description
This code defines a simple Chainlit application that sends a greeting message when a chat session starts. It utilizes the Chainlit library to create an interactive chat interface.

## Symbols

### `main()`
#### Description
This asynchronous function is decorated with `@cl.on_chat_start`, indicating that it will be executed when a new chat session begins. Its purpose is to send an initial greeting message to the user.

#### Inputs
This function does not take any explicit inputs.

#### Outputs
This function does not return any values explicitly.

#### Internal Logic
1. The function creates a new `cl.Message` object with the content "Hello!".
2. It then sends this message asynchronously using the `send()` method.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| chainlit | Used to create the chat interface and handle chat-related events |

## Side Effects
The function sends a message to the chat interface when called, which will be visible to the user.

## Notes
- This code represents a minimal Chainlit application setup.
- The `@cl.on_chat_start` decorator is a key feature of Chainlit, used to define actions that should occur when a new chat session begins.
- The code is designed to run in an asynchronous environment, as indicated by the `async` keyword and `await` statement.
