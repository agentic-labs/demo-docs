## High-level description
This directory contains files for a custom build configuration of a Chainlit chatbot application. It includes a Cypress end-to-end test, a simple Python script for the chatbot, a configuration file, and a static HTML page for testing purposes.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory sets up a basic chatbot application using Chainlit and provides a custom build configuration for it. The main functionality includes:

1. Configuring the Chainlit application with specific settings for features, UI, and project parameters.
2. Implementing a simple chatbot that sends a greeting message when a chat session starts.
3. Providing a custom build directory for the frontend.
4. Including a static HTML page for testing the custom build configuration.
5. Implementing a Cypress test to verify that the custom build page is correctly served.

## Entry points
The main entry points for this directory are:

1. `main.py`: This file contains the core logic for the Chainlit chatbot application. It defines the behavior of the chatbot when a new chat session starts.

2. `spec.cy.ts`: This is the Cypress test file that verifies the correct functioning of the custom build configuration.

3. `.chainlit`: This TOML configuration file sets up various parameters for the Chainlit application, including the custom build directory.

The data flow in this setup starts from the configuration file, which defines how the application should behave. The `main.py` file implements the chatbot logic based on these configurations. The Cypress test in `spec.cy.ts` then verifies that the custom build is working as expected by checking the content served by the application.

## Key Files
1. `.chainlit`: This TOML configuration file is crucial as it defines the settings for the Chainlit application, including the custom build directory and various feature toggles.

2. `main.py`: This Python script implements the core functionality of the chatbot, defining what happens when a new chat session starts.

3. `public/index.html`: This static HTML file serves as a test page for the custom build configuration.

4. `spec.cy.ts`: This Cypress test file ensures that the custom build configuration is working correctly by verifying the content of the served page.

## Dependencies
The main dependencies for this project are:

1. Chainlit: Used for creating the chatbot application. The version is not specified in the provided files.

2. Cypress: Used for end-to-end testing. The version is not specified, but it's using the `@cypress/e2e` module.

3. TOML: Used for the configuration file format. The version is not specified.

These dependencies were likely chosen for their specific purposes:
- Chainlit for its ease of use in creating chatbot applications
- Cypress for its robust end-to-end testing capabilities
- TOML for its human-readable and easy-to-use configuration file format

## Configuration
The main configuration file is `.chainlit`, which uses the TOML format. Key configuration options include:

```toml
[project]
enable_telemetry = true
session_timeout = 3600
cache = false
allow_origins = ["*"]

[features]
prompt_playground = true
unsafe_allow_html = false
latex = false

[UI]
name = "Chatbot"
show_readme_as_default = true
custom_build = "./public/build"
```

These settings control various aspects of the Chainlit application, such as telemetry, session timeout, feature toggles, and UI customization. The `custom_build` option is particularly important as it specifies the directory for the custom frontend build.

The configuration also includes commented-out examples for customizing light and dark themes, which can be uncommented and modified as needed.

In summary, this directory sets up a basic Chainlit chatbot application with a custom build configuration, provides a test page, and includes a Cypress test to verify the correct functioning of the custom build setup.
