## High-level description
This Cypress test file (`cypress/e2e/custom_build/spec.cy.ts`) contains a test suite for a custom build configuration. It sets up a test server and verifies that a specific page is correctly served with the expected content.

## Symbols

### `describe("Custom Build", () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
This is the main test suite for the Custom Build feature. It contains setup code and individual test cases.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up a test server before running the tests.
2. Contains a single test case to verify the custom build page.

### `before(() =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
This is a setup hook that runs once before all tests in the suite.

#### Internal Logic
Calls the `runTestServer()` function to start the test server.

### `it("should correctly serve the custom build page", () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
This is a test case that verifies if the custom build page is correctly served.

#### Internal Logic
1. Implicitly visits the root URL (set up by the test server).
2. Checks if the page body contains the expected text for the custom build configuration.

## References
- `runTestServer()`: This function is imported from `../../support/testUtils` and is used to set up the test environment.

## Notes on Related Code
The `testUtils.ts` file contains several utility functions for Cypress tests, including `runTestServer()`. This function:
1. Determines the test name from the current spec file path.
2. Executes a TypeScript script to run the test server for the specific test.
3. Visits the root URL of the server.

The `runTestServer()` function can optionally take an execution mode and environment variables as parameters, although they are not used in this specific test file.
