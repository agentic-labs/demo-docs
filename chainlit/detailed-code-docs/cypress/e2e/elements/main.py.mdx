## High-level description
This code defines a Cypress end-to-end test for the Chainlit application, focusing on testing the functionality of displaying various elements (images, PDFs, and text) in chat messages. It demonstrates how different types of elements can be included in messages and how they are displayed based on their configuration.

## Code Structure
The code consists of two main functions: `gen_img()` and `start()`. The `gen_img()` function is a step that generates an image, while the `start()` function is the main test scenario that sends multiple messages with different combinations of elements.

## Symbols

### `gen_img()`
#### Description
This function is a Chainlit step that generates and returns an image element.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| return value | cl.Image | An image element representing a cat picture |

#### Internal Logic
The function creates and returns a `cl.Image` object with a specified path, name, and display setting.

___

### `start()`
#### Description
This is the main test function that runs when a chat session starts. It sends multiple messages with various combinations of elements to test different display scenarios.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls `gen_img()` to get an image element.
2. Sends a message with the image element not inlined or referenced.
3. Sends a message with multiple elements (image, PDF, and text) with different display settings.
4. Sends another message with similar elements to test element reference handling when names collide.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| chainlit | Used for creating and sending messages with various elements |

## Side Effects
The function sends multiple messages to the chat interface, which will be visible to the user during the test execution.

## Performance Considerations
This test may involve loading external resources (image and PDF files), which could affect performance if the files are large or network conditions are poor.

## Error Handling
The code does not implement explicit error handling. Any errors that occur during execution will likely be caught by the Cypress test runner.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code.
