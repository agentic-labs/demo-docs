## High-level description
This Cypress test suite, located in `cypress/e2e/elements/spec.cy.ts`, verifies the functionality of displaying various types of elements (inline, side, and page) within a web application. It checks for the presence and behavior of images, links, and PDF elements across different steps of the application.

## Code Structure
The test suite consists of a single describe block containing one test case. It utilizes the `runTestServer` function from a separate utility file to set up the test environment.

## References
- `runTestServer` function from `../../support/testUtils`

## Symbols

### `describe('Elements', ...)`
#### Description
This is the main test suite for testing element display functionality.

#### Internal Logic
1. Runs the test server before executing the tests.
2. Contains a single test case that checks for various elements across different steps.

### `it('should be able to display inlined, side and page elements', ...)`
#### Description
This test case verifies the presence and behavior of different types of elements (inline, side, and page) within the application.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks for the absence of elements in the first step.
2. Verifies the presence of inline images in the second step.
3. Checks for inline images, element links, and inline PDFs in the third and fourth steps.
4. Tests the functionality of a side view element:
   - Clicks on the first element link in the third step.
   - Verifies the existence and content of the side view title and content.
5. Tests the functionality of a page view element:
   - Clicks on the second element link in the third step.
   - Verifies the existence and content of the page view.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Cypress | End-to-end testing framework used for writing and running the tests |

## Configuration
The test relies on the following selectors and classes:
- `.step`: Represents different steps in the application
- `.inline-image`: Inline image elements
- `.element-link`: Links to side or page elements
- `.inline-pdf`: Inline PDF elements
- `#side-view-title`: Title of the side view
- `#side-view-content`: Content of the side view
- `#element-view`: Container for the page view

Note: These selectors and classes are assumed to be present in the application being tested.

## Error Handling
The test relies on Cypress's built-in assertion and error handling mechanisms. If any of the assertions fail, Cypress will report the failure and provide details about the failed assertion.

## Performance Considerations
The test includes multiple assertions and interactions with the DOM, which may impact performance for larger applications. Consider breaking down the test into smaller, more focused tests if performance becomes an issue.
