## High-level description
This directory contains end-to-end tests for the Chainlit application, focusing on testing the functionality of displaying various elements (images, PDFs, and text) in chat messages. The tests are implemented using Cypress, a popular end-to-end testing framework for web applications.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory sets up and runs tests to verify that the Chainlit application can correctly display different types of elements in chat messages. These elements include inline images, side-view elements, page-view elements, and PDFs. The tests simulate a chat session, send messages with various combinations of these elements, and then verify that they are displayed correctly in the user interface.

## Entry points
The main entry point for the tests is the `spec.cy.ts` file, which contains the Cypress test suite. This file defines the test scenarios and assertions. The `main.py` file contains the Python code that generates the test data and simulates the chat session. The `.chainlit` configuration file sets up the environment and features for the Chainlit application being tested.

## Key Files
1. `spec.cy.ts`: This is the main Cypress test file. It contains a test suite that verifies the presence and behavior of different types of elements (inline, side, and page) within the application.

2. `main.py`: This Python file defines the test scenario for the Chainlit application. It contains functions to generate test data (like images) and simulate a chat session with various types of messages and elements.

3. `.chainlit`: This is a TOML configuration file for the Chainlit project. It defines various settings and features for the chatbot application being tested, including UI customizations and feature toggles.

## Dependencies
The main dependencies for this test suite are:

1. Cypress: Used for writing and running the end-to-end tests.
2. Chainlit: The application being tested, which is used for creating and sending messages with various elements.

## Configuration
The `.chainlit` file contains extensive configuration options for the Chainlit application. Some key configurations include:

- Telemetry is enabled by default
- Session timeout is set to 3600 seconds (1 hour)
- Caching is disabled
- CORS is allowed for all origins
- Prompt playground is enabled
- HTML rendering in messages is disabled for security
- LaTeX rendering is disabled
- Multi-modal file upload feature is enabled
- Speech-to-text feature is disabled

The chatbot name is set to "Chatbot", and the UI is configured to show the readme as default when the thread is empty.

## Code Snippets

Here's an example of how the test in `spec.cy.ts` verifies the presence of elements:

```typescript
cy.get('.step').eq(1).find('.inline-image').should('have.length', 1);
cy.get('.step').eq(2).find('.inline-image').should('have.length', 2);
cy.get('.step').eq(2).find('.element-link').should('have.length', 2);
cy.get('.step').eq(2).find('.inline-pdf').should('have.length', 1);
```

And here's how the `main.py` file generates and sends messages with different elements:

```python
img = gen_img()
await cl.Message(content="Here's an image:", elements=[img]).send()

await cl.Message(
    content="Here are multiple elements:",
    elements=[
        img.copy(name="img1", display="inline"),
        cl.Pdf(name="pdf1", path="./test.pdf", display="inline"),
        cl.Text(name="text1", content="Hello world!", display="side"),
        img.copy(name="img2", display="page"),
    ],
).send()
```

These code snippets demonstrate how the tests are structured to verify the correct display of various elements in the Chainlit application.
