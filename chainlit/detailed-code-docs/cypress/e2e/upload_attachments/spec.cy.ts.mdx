## High-level description
This Cypress test suite verifies the functionality of uploading file attachments in a web application. It tests the ability to upload files through both drag-and-drop input and an upload button, and checks if the uploaded files are correctly displayed and accessible.

## Code Structure
The test suite consists of a single describe block with one test case. It uses helper functions from the testUtils file for setup and message submission. The main test logic is divided into two parts: testing file upload via drag-and-drop and via an upload button.

## References
- `runTestServer` and `submitMessage` functions from '../../support/testUtils'

## Symbols

### `describe('Upload attachments', ...)`
#### Description
This is the main test suite for uploading attachments. It sets up the test environment and contains the test case for file uploads.

#### Internal Logic
1. Runs the test server before each test using `runTestServer()`.
2. Defines a helper function `shouldHaveInlineAttachments()` to check if uploaded files are correctly displayed.
3. Contains one test case that checks file upload functionality.

### `shouldHaveInlineAttachments()`
#### Description
A helper function that verifies if uploaded attachments are correctly displayed in the UI.

#### Internal Logic
1. Submits a message with attachments.
2. Checks for the correct number of steps and their content.
3. Verifies the presence and attributes of inline file attachments.

### `it('Should be able to upload file attachments', ...)`
#### Description
The main test case that verifies the ability to upload file attachments through different methods.

#### Internal Logic
1. Loads fixture files (txt, cpp, and py) for testing.
2. Tests file upload using drag-and-drop input:
   - Uploads three different file types.
   - Verifies that uploaded files are displayed in the attachments area.
   - Calls `shouldHaveInlineAttachments()` to check inline attachments.
3. Reloads the page.
4. Tests file upload using the upload button:
   - Uploads the same three file types.
   - Verifies that uploaded files are displayed in the attachments area.
   - Calls `shouldHaveInlineAttachments()` to check inline attachments.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Cypress | End-to-end testing framework used for writing and running the tests |

## Configuration
The test uses Cypress fixtures to load test files:
- 'state_of_the_union.txt'
- 'hello.cpp'
- 'hello.py'

These files should be present in the Cypress fixtures directory for the test to run successfully.
