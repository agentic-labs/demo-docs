## High-level description
This code defines a Chainlit application that handles incoming messages and their attachments. It responds to each message by echoing its content and acknowledging any attached elements individually.

## Symbols

### `main`
#### Description
This asynchronous function is the main message handler for the Chainlit application. It's decorated with `@cl.on_message`, indicating it's triggered whenever a message is received. The function processes the message content and any attached elements, sending responses for each.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| message | cl.Message | The incoming message object from Chainlit |

#### Outputs
This function doesn't return a value but sends messages asynchronously.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sends a message echoing the content of the received message.
2. Iterates through the `elements` of the message (if any).
3. For each element, sends a message acknowledging its receipt, including the element's index and name.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| chainlit | The main framework used for building the conversational AI application |

## Error Handling
The code doesn't implement explicit error handling. It relies on Chainlit's built-in error handling mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference
While not explicitly defining an API, this code sets up a message handler for a Chainlit application:

| Handler | Trigger | Description |
|:--------|:--------|:------------|
| main | On message received | Processes incoming messages and their attachments |
