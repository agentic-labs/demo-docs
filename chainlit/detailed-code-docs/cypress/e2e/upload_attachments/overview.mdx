## High-level description
This directory contains files for testing and implementing file upload functionality in a Chainlit-based chatbot application. It includes a Cypress test suite for verifying file upload features, a Python script that handles incoming messages and attachments, and a Chainlit configuration file.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory implements and tests a file upload feature for a chatbot application. Here's a breakdown of the main functionalities:

1. The chatbot can receive messages with file attachments.
2. Users can upload files through drag-and-drop or by clicking an upload button.
3. The chatbot acknowledges receipt of messages and individual file attachments.
4. The system supports various file types, including text files, C++ files, and Python files.
5. Uploaded files are displayed inline in the chat interface.
6. The Cypress test suite verifies that all these features work correctly, ensuring that files can be uploaded, are displayed properly, and that the chatbot responds appropriately.

## Key Files

1. `spec.cy.ts`: This is the Cypress test suite that verifies the file upload functionality. It tests both drag-and-drop and button-click upload methods, and checks if uploaded files are correctly displayed and accessible.

2. `main.py`: This Python script defines the core functionality of the chatbot. It handles incoming messages and their attachments, responding to each message by echoing its content and acknowledging any attached files individually.

3. `.chainlit`: This TOML configuration file sets up various aspects of the Chainlit application, including project-wide settings, feature toggles, and UI customizations.

## Dependencies
The main dependencies for this project are:

1. Chainlit: This is the primary framework used for building the conversational AI application. It's used in both the Python script and referenced in the configuration file.

2. Cypress: Version not specified. This end-to-end testing framework is used for writing and running the tests in `spec.cy.ts`.

## Configuration
The `.chainlit` file contains extensive configuration options for the Chainlit application. Some key configurations include:

- Telemetry is enabled by default
- Session timeout is set to 3600 seconds (1 hour)
- Caching is disabled
- CORS is allowed for all origins
- Prompt playground is enabled
- HTML rendering in messages is disabled for security
- LaTeX rendering is disabled
- Automatic thread tagging is enabled

The file also includes configurations for file upload settings, audio recording parameters, and various UI customizations.

## Code Examples

Here's an example of how the chatbot handles incoming messages and attachments in `main.py`:

```python
@cl.on_message
async def main(message: cl.Message):
    await cl.Message(content=f"Received: {message.content}").send()
    for i, element in enumerate(message.elements):
        await cl.Message(content=f"Received element {i}: {element.name}").send()
```

And here's a snippet from the Cypress test in `spec.cy.ts` that demonstrates file upload testing:

```typescript
cy.get('.drop-zone').selectFile(
  ['cypress/fixtures/state_of_the_union.txt', 'cypress/fixtures/hello.cpp', 'cypress/fixtures/hello.py'],
  { action: 'drag-drop' }
);

cy.get('.file-attachment').should('have.length', 3);
cy.get('.file-attachment').eq(0).should('contain', 'state_of_the_union.txt');
cy.get('.file-attachment').eq(1).should('contain', 'hello.cpp');
cy.get('.file-attachment').eq(2).should('contain', 'hello.py');
```

These code examples illustrate how the application handles file uploads and how the functionality is tested.
