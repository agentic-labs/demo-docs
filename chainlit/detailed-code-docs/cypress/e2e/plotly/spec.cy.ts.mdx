## High-level description
This Cypress test suite verifies the functionality of displaying an inline Plotly chart in a web application. It sets up a test server and checks for the presence of a single step containing an inline Plotly chart.

## Symbols

### `describe('plotly', ...)`
#### Description
This is the main test suite for Plotly functionality. It sets up the test environment and contains individual test cases.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses the `before` hook to run the test server before executing any tests.
2. Contains a single test case to check for the presence of an inline Plotly chart.

### `before(() =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
This hook runs before any tests in the suite, setting up the test environment.

#### Internal Logic
Calls the `runTestServer()` function to start the test server.

### `it('should be able to display an inline chart', ...)`
#### Description
This test case verifies the presence of a single step containing an inline Plotly chart.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks that there is exactly one element with the class 'step'.
2. Verifies that the first (and only) 'step' element contains an element with the class 'inline-plotly'.

## References
- `runTestServer()`: This function is imported from '../../support/testUtils' and is used to start the test server.

## Notes
1. The test assumes that the application under test displays a single step with an inline Plotly chart when loaded.
2. The `runTestServer()` function is likely responsible for setting up a local server environment for testing, but its implementation details are not provided in the given code.
3. The test uses Cypress commands like `cy.get()` and `should()` to interact with and assert on DOM elements.
4. The test doesn't interact with the chart itself; it only checks for its presence in the DOM.
