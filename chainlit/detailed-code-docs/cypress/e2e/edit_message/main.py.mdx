## High-level description
This code defines a Chainlit application that responds to incoming messages by sending a message containing the current length of the chat context. It utilizes the Chainlit library to handle message events and manage the chat context.

## Symbols

### `main()`
#### Description
This asynchronous function is the main event handler for incoming messages in the Chainlit application. It is decorated with `@cl.on_message`, indicating that it will be called whenever a new message is received.

#### Inputs
This function doesn't explicitly take any inputs. However, it implicitly uses the global chat context managed by Chainlit.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| None | None | The function doesn't return a value, but it sends a message as a side effect. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the current chat context using `cl.chat_context.get()`.
2. Calculates the length of the chat context.
3. Creates a new `cl.Message` object with content showing the chat context length.
4. Sends the message asynchronously using the `send()` method.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| chainlit | Used for building the chat application, handling messages, and managing chat context. |

## Side Effects
- Sends a message to the chat interface with the current chat context length.

## Notes
- The application responds to every incoming message with information about the chat context length.
- This code could be useful for debugging or monitoring the state of the chat context during conversations.
- The chat context likely includes the history of the conversation, which explains why its length is being reported.
