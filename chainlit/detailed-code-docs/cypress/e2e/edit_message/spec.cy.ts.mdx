## High-level description
This Cypress test file (`spec.cy.ts`) contains a test suite for the "Edit Message" functionality. It verifies that a user can edit a previously submitted message in a chat-like interface and checks the resulting changes in the chat context.

## Symbols

### `describe('Edit Message', () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
This is the main test suite for the "Edit Message" functionality. It sets up the test environment and contains a single test case.

#### Internal Logic
1. Before running the tests, it calls `runTestServer()` to set up the test environment.
2. Contains one test case for editing a message.

### `it('should be able to edit a message', () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
This test case verifies the ability to edit a message and checks the resulting changes in the chat context.

#### Internal Logic
1. Submits two initial messages using `submitMessage()`.
2. Verifies the initial state of the chat (4 steps, including context length).
3. Edits the first message by clicking the edit icon, typing new content, and confirming the edit.
4. Verifies the final state of the chat (2 steps, updated context length).

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `runTestServer` | Sets up the test environment |
| `submitMessage` | Submits a message in the chat interface |

## References
- `cypress/support/testUtils.ts`: Contains utility functions used in this test, such as `runTestServer` and `submitMessage`.

## Notes
1. The test uses Cypress commands (`cy.get()`, `cy.wait()`, etc.) to interact with and assert on the DOM elements.
2. The test assumes a specific structure of the chat interface, including elements with classes like `.step`, `.edit-icon`, and `.confirm-edit`.
3. The test checks for changes in the number of steps and the chat context length after editing a message.
