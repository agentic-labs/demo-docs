## High-level description
This directory contains files related to chat settings functionality and testing for a Chainlit-based chatbot application. It includes configuration files, a main Python script for setting up the chat interface, and a Cypress test suite for verifying the chat settings functionality.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory sets up a customizable chat interface for a chatbot application. It allows users to adjust various settings for OpenAI and Stability AI models, such as model selection, temperature, token streaming, and image generation parameters. The Cypress test suite ensures that these settings can be properly updated and persisted through the user interface.

The workflow is as follows:
1. The Chainlit configuration file (.chainlit) sets up the overall project settings and features.
2. The main Python script (main.py) initializes the chat interface with customizable settings.
3. Users can interact with the chat interface to adjust these settings.
4. The Cypress test suite (spec.cy.ts) verifies that the settings can be properly updated and saved through the user interface.

## Key Files

### .chainlit
This TOML configuration file defines various settings for the Chainlit chatbot application, including project settings, features, user interface options, and theming. It controls aspects such as telemetry, session timeout, CORS settings, and UI appearance.

### main.py
This Python script sets up the Chainlit chat application with customizable settings for OpenAI and Stability AI models. It defines input widgets for users to adjust model parameters and handles the initialization and updating of these settings. The script uses Chainlit decorators to define event handlers for chat start and settings updates.

### spec.cy.ts
This Cypress test suite verifies the functionality of customizing chat settings in the web application. It tests opening the settings modal, updating various input fields, confirming changes, and ensuring the updated values persist after closing and reopening the modal.

## Dependencies
The main dependencies for this project are:

1. Chainlit (version 1.0.504): The primary framework used for building the chat application.
2. Cypress: Used for end-to-end testing of the chat settings functionality.

## Configuration
The chat application can be configured through various settings, including:

1. OpenAI model selection (e.g., gpt-3.5-turbo)
2. Token streaming toggle
3. Temperature adjustment (0-2)
4. Stability AI parameters:
   - Inference steps (0-150)
   - CFG scale (1-35)
   - Image width and height (0-2048 pixels)

These settings can be adjusted through the user interface and are tested for proper functionality using the Cypress test suite.

The Chainlit configuration file (.chainlit) also provides additional project-wide settings, such as:

- Telemetry enablement
- Session timeout
- HTML processing in messages
- Audio recording parameters
- UI theming options

By combining these configuration options and the customizable chat settings, developers can create a highly flexible and tailored chatbot experience for their users.
