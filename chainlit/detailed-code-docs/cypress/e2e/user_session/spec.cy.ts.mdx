## High-level description
This Cypress test file (`spec.cy.ts`) focuses on testing user session functionality in a chat application. It verifies that the application can store and manage data related to individual user sessions, including the ability to create new sessions and maintain message history within each session.

## Code Structure
The file contains a single test suite (`describe` block) with one test case. It utilizes helper functions from the `testUtils.ts` file for common operations like submitting messages and running the test server.

## References
- `../../support/testUtils`: Imports `runTestServer` and `submitMessage` functions.

## Symbols

### `newSession()`
#### Description
This function simulates the creation of a new chat session by interacting with UI elements.

#### Internal Logic
1. Clicks the new chat button in the header.
2. Waits for the new chat dialog to appear.
3. Confirms the new session creation.
4. Verifies that the dialog disappears.

### `describe('User Session', ...)`
#### Description
This is the main test suite for user session functionality.

#### Internal Logic
1. Runs the test server before executing the tests.
2. Contains a single test case for verifying session-related data storage.

### `it('should be able to store data related per user session', ...)`
#### Description
This test case verifies that the application correctly manages data for individual user sessions.

#### Internal Logic
1. Submits two messages in the first session and verifies the message history.
2. Creates a new session.
3. Submits two more messages in the new session and verifies that the message history is reset.
4. Checks that the previous message is correctly displayed in each session.

## Error Handling
The test relies on Cypress's built-in assertion and error handling mechanisms. If any of the assertions fail, the test will fail and provide detailed error information.

## Performance Considerations
The test includes several `cy.wait(1000)` calls in the imported `submitMessage` function, which may impact the overall test execution time. These waits are likely in place to ensure UI stability between actions, but they could potentially be optimized or replaced with more specific wait conditions if performance becomes a concern.
