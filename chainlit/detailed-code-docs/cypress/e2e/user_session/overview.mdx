## High-level description
This directory contains files related to user session management and testing in a Chainlit-based chatbot application. It includes a configuration file, a main Python script for handling messages, and a Cypress test specification for verifying user session functionality.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory implements and tests a simple chatbot that remembers the previous message in each user session. Here's how it works:

1. The chatbot is configured using a TOML file, which sets up various project settings, including session timeout and UI customization.
2. The main Python script handles incoming messages, retrieves the previous message from the user's session, sends it back to the user, and then updates the session with the current message.
3. The Cypress test file verifies that the application correctly manages data for individual user sessions, including creating new sessions and maintaining message history within each session.

This setup allows for testing the chatbot's ability to maintain separate conversation contexts for different users or chat sessions.

## Key Files

1. `.chainlit` (TOML configuration file):
   - Configures project settings, including telemetry, session timeout, and UI customization.
   - Enables features like the prompt playground.
   - Sets the chatbot name and default UI behavior.

2. `main.py` (Python script):
   - Implements the main message handler using Chainlit.
   - Retrieves the previous message from the user session.
   - Sends the previous message back to the user.
   - Updates the user session with the current message.

3. `spec.cy.ts` (Cypress test specification):
   - Contains a test suite for verifying user session functionality.
   - Tests the creation of new chat sessions.
   - Verifies that message history is maintained separately for each session.

## Dependencies
The code relies on the following main dependencies:

1. Chainlit: A framework for building conversational AI applications. It's used for message handling and user session management in the main Python script.

2. Cypress: An end-to-end testing framework used for running the tests in the `spec.cy.ts` file.

## Configuration
The `.chainlit` file contains various configuration options for the project:

```toml
[project]
enable_telemetry = true
user_env = []
session_timeout = 3600
cache = false

[features]
prompt_playground = true

[UI]
name = "Chatbot"
default_collapse_content = true
default_expand_messages = false
hide_cot = false
```

Key configuration fields include:
- `session_timeout`: Set to 3600 seconds (1 hour) for saving the session when the connection is lost.
- `prompt_playground`: Enabled to show the prompt playground feature.
- `name`: Set to "Chatbot" for both the app and chatbot name.

The configuration file also includes commented-out options for UI theme customization, which can be uncommented and modified as needed.

In summary, this directory contains the essential components for implementing and testing a simple chatbot with user session management, demonstrating how to maintain conversation context across multiple chat sessions.
