title: "pytest.yaml"

## High-level description
This YAML file defines a GitHub Actions workflow named "Pytest" that runs pytest with coverage for a Python project. The workflow is designed to be called by other workflows and executes in the `backend` directory of the repository.

## Code Structure
The workflow consists of a single job named "mypy" (which seems to be a misnomer as it's actually running pytest) with several steps to set up the environment and run the tests.

## Symbols

### Workflow: Pytest
#### Description
This GitHub Actions workflow is triggered by a `workflow_call` event, meaning it's designed to be reusable and called from other workflows. It sets up a Python environment, installs dependencies using Poetry, and runs pytest with coverage.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks out the repository
2. Sets up Python 3.9
3. Installs Poetry
4. Installs project dependencies using Poetry
5. Runs pytest with coverage

### Job: mypy
#### Description
Despite its name, this job actually runs pytest. It's executed on an Ubuntu latest runner and performs all the steps necessary to set up the environment and run the tests.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the working directory to `./backend`
2. Checks out the code
3. Sets up Python 3.9 with pip caching
4. Installs Poetry
5. Installs project dependencies with specific groups (tests, mypy, custom-data)
6. Runs pytest with coverage for the `chainlit/` directory

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| actions/checkout@v3 | Checks out the repository code |
| actions/setup-python@v4 | Sets up the Python environment |
| Poetry | Python dependency management tool |
| pytest | Testing framework |
| pytest-cov | Coverage plugin for pytest |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| python-version | string | '3.9' | Specifies the Python version to use |
| working-directory | string | ./backend | Sets the working directory for the job |

## Notes
1. The job name "mypy" is misleading as it's actually running pytest, not mypy.
2. The workflow uses Poetry for dependency management, which is a modern Python packaging and dependency management tool.
3. The pytest command includes coverage reporting for the `chainlit/` directory.
4. The workflow is designed to be called by other workflows, allowing for reuse across different CI/CD processes.
5. The Poetry installation includes additional groups: "tests", "mypy", and "custom-data", which likely contain extra dependencies for testing and type checking.
