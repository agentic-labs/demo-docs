## High-level description
This GitHub Actions workflow file defines an end-to-end (E2E) testing process for a project that includes both JavaScript (UI) and Python (backend) components. It sets up the necessary environment, installs dependencies, builds and lints the UI, and runs tests across multiple operating systems.

## Code Structure
The workflow is structured as a single job named "ci" that runs on both Ubuntu and Windows latest versions. It consists of several steps that set up the environment, install dependencies, and execute various build and test commands.

## Symbols

### `E2ETests`
#### Description
This is the name of the GitHub Actions workflow. It's designed to be called by other workflows, as indicated by the `workflow_call` trigger.

### `ci` job
#### Description
The main job of the workflow, which runs the entire E2E testing process.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| matrix.os | string[] | List of operating systems to run the job on |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks out the repository
2. Sets up pnpm package manager
3. Sets up Node.js
4. Sets up Python
5. Installs Poetry (Python dependency manager)
6. Installs JavaScript dependencies
7. Builds the UI
8. Lints the UI
9. Installs Python dependencies
10. Runs tests

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| pnpm | JavaScript package manager |
| Node.js | JavaScript runtime |
| Python | Backend language |
| Poetry | Python dependency manager |

### Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| pnpm version | string | 8.6.9 | Version of pnpm to use |
| Node.js version | string | 16.15.0 | Version of Node.js to use |
| Python version | string | 3.9 | Version of Python to use |

## Error Handling
This workflow does not implement specific error handling. If any step fails, the workflow will stop and report the failure.

## Environment Variables
| Name | Description |
|:-----|:------------|
| CYPRESS_RECORD_KEY | Secret key for recording Cypress tests |

## Notes
1. The workflow uses a matrix strategy to run on both Ubuntu and Windows.
2. It caches both pnpm and pip dependencies to speed up subsequent runs.
3. The UI is built and linted before running tests.
4. Python dependencies are installed with Poetry, including test dependencies.
5. The final test command uses pnpm, suggesting the tests might be run using a JavaScript test runner, possibly for both frontend and backend tests.
