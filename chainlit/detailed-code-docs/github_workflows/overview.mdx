## High-level description
This directory contains GitHub Actions workflow files that define the Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) processes for a Python project with a JavaScript UI component. The workflows cover various aspects of the development lifecycle, including testing, type checking, end-to-end testing, and package publishing.

## What does it do?
The workflows in this directory automate several key processes:

1. Continuous Integration (CI): Runs tests, type checking, and end-to-end tests whenever code is pushed or a pull request is made to the main or dev branches.
2. Python Testing: Executes pytest with coverage on the Python codebase.
3. Type Checking: Performs static type checking using mypy on the Python code.
4. End-to-End Testing: Runs comprehensive tests that cover both the JavaScript UI and Python backend components across multiple operating systems.
5. Package Publishing: Automates the process of building and publishing the Python package to PyPI when a new release is created.

These workflows ensure code quality, catch potential issues early in the development process, and streamline the release process.

## Key Files

1. `ci.yaml`: The main CI workflow that orchestrates the execution of tests, type checking, and end-to-end tests.
2. `pytest.yaml`: Defines a reusable workflow for running pytest with coverage on the Python codebase.
3. `mypy.yaml`: Implements a reusable workflow for running mypy static type checking on the Python code.
4. `e2e-tests.yaml`: Sets up and runs end-to-end tests covering both the JavaScript UI and Python backend.
5. `publish.yaml`: Automates the process of building and publishing the Python package to PyPI.

## Dependencies
The workflows rely on several external actions and tools:

1. Python 3.9: The primary programming language used in the project.
2. Poetry: Used for Python dependency management and packaging.
3. Node.js 16.15.0: Required for the JavaScript components of the project.
4. pnpm 8.6.9: Used as the package manager for JavaScript dependencies.
5. pytest and pytest-cov: For running Python tests with coverage.
6. mypy: For static type checking of Python code.
7. Cypress: Likely used for end-to-end testing, as indicated by the presence of a Cypress record key.

## Configuration
The workflows use various configuration options and environment variables:

1. GitHub Secrets: Used for storing sensitive information like PyPI credentials and Cypress record key.
2. Working Directory: Most Python-related jobs are configured to run in the `./backend` directory.
3. Python Version: Set to 3.9 across all workflows.
4. Node.js Version: Set to 16.15.0 for JavaScript-related tasks.
5. pnpm Version: Set to 8.6.9 for managing JavaScript dependencies.

The CI workflow is triggered on pull requests and pushes to the main and dev branches, as well as manually through workflow dispatch. The publish workflow is triggered either manually or when a new release is published.

These workflows provide a comprehensive automation setup for the project, ensuring code quality, thorough testing, and streamlined releases.
