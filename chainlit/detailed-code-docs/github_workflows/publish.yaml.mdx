## High-level description
This GitHub Actions workflow, named "Publish," is designed to automate the process of publishing a Python package to PyPI. It is triggered either manually or when a new release is published. The workflow runs tests, builds the package, and then uploads it to PyPI using trusted publishing.

## Code Structure
The workflow consists of two main jobs: `tests` and `build-n-publish`. The `build-n-publish` job depends on the successful completion of the `tests` job. It sets up the necessary environment, builds the package, and publishes it to PyPI.

## Symbols

### `tests` job
#### Description
This job runs the tests for the project. It uses a reusable workflow defined in `.github/workflows/tests.yaml`.

#### Inputs
None specified in this file.

#### Outputs
None specified, but the job's success is required for the `build-n-publish` job to run.

### `build-n-publish` job
#### Description
This job is responsible for building the package and publishing it to PyPI.

#### Inputs
None explicitly defined, but it uses secrets and environment variables.

#### Outputs
The final output is the published package on PyPI.

#### Internal Logic
1. Check out the main branch of the repository
2. Set up pnpm, Node.js, Python, and Poetry
3. Copy the README.md file to the backend directory
4. Install JavaScript dependencies
5. Build the Chainlit package
6. Publish the package to PyPI using trusted publishing

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| actions/checkout@v3 | To check out the repository |
| pnpm/action-setup@v2 | To set up pnpm package manager |
| actions/setup-node@v3 | To set up Node.js environment |
| actions/setup-python@v4 | To set up Python environment |
| snok/install-poetry@v1 | To install Poetry for Python package management |
| pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish@release/v1 | To publish the package to PyPI |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| name | string | pypi | Name of the package |
| url | string | https://pypi.org/p/chainlit | URL of the package on PyPI |

## Error Handling
No specific error handling is implemented in this workflow. It relies on the default behavior of GitHub Actions, which will stop the workflow if any step fails.

## Permissions
The workflow specifies the following permissions for the `build-n-publish` job:
- `contents: read`: Allows reading repository contents
- `id-token: write`: Allows writing ID tokens, which is required for trusted publishing to PyPI

These permissions are crucial for the security of the publishing process.
