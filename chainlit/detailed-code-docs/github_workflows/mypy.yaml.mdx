title: "mypy.yaml"

## High-level description
This YAML file defines a GitHub Actions workflow named "Mypy" that runs static type checking on a Python project using the Mypy tool. The workflow is designed to be called by other workflows and executes in the backend directory of the repository.

## Code Structure
The workflow consists of a single job named "mypy" with several steps that set up the environment, install dependencies, and run the Mypy type checker.

### Workflow: Mypy
#### Description
This GitHub Actions workflow is responsible for running Mypy static type checking on the Python codebase.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| workflow_call | event | Trigger for this workflow to be called by other workflows |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up the job to run on the latest Ubuntu environment
2. Configures the working directory to `./backend`
3. Checks out the repository
4. Sets up Python 3.9 with pip caching
5. Installs Poetry (Python dependency management tool)
6. Installs project dependencies using Poetry
7. Runs Mypy on the `chainlit/` directory

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| actions/checkout@v3 | Checks out the repository |
| actions/setup-python@v4 | Sets up Python environment |
| pip | Used to install Poetry |
| poetry | Python dependency management tool |
| mypy | Static type checker for Python |

### Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| python-version | string | '3.9' | Specifies the Python version to use |
| cache | string | 'pip' | Enables caching for pip |

## Error Handling
This workflow does not implement explicit error handling. If any step fails, the workflow will stop and report the failure.

___

This workflow file sets up a Mypy static type checking process for a Python project. It uses GitHub Actions to automate the process, ensuring that type checking is performed consistently. The workflow is designed to be called by other workflows, allowing for flexible integration into the project's CI/CD pipeline.

The workflow uses Poetry for dependency management, which allows for precise control over the project's dependencies. It installs dependencies with specific groups (tests, mypy, and custom-data), suggesting that the project has different sets of dependencies for various purposes.

The Mypy check is run specifically on the `chainlit/` directory, indicating that this is likely the main package or module of the project that requires type checking.
