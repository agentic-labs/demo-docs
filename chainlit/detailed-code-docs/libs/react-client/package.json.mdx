## High-level description
This package.json file defines the configuration and dependencies for the @chainlit/react-client package. It is a WebSocket client library designed to connect to Chainlit applications, providing React hooks and utilities for managing chat sessions and interactions.

## Code Structure
The package.json file contains metadata about the project, including its name, version, and description. It also defines scripts for building, testing, and publishing the package, as well as specifying dependencies and peer dependencies.

## Symbols

### name
#### Description
The name of the package, "@chainlit/react-client".

### version
#### Description
The current version of the package, "0.1.3".

### scripts
#### Description
Defines various npm scripts for building, testing, and publishing the package.

#### Internal Logic
- `build`: Uses tsup to build the package in ESM and CJS formats with TypeScript declarations.
- `dev`: Similar to build, but likely used during development.
- `lint`: Runs ESLint on TypeScript and TypeScript React files.
- `format`: Uses Prettier to format TypeScript and TypeScript React files.
- `test`: Currently a placeholder (no tests implemented yet).
- `prepublish`: Runs the build script before publishing.

### dependencies
#### Description
Lists the runtime dependencies of the package.

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| socket.io-client | WebSocket client for real-time communication |
| jwt-decode | Decoding JSON Web Tokens |
| swr | React Hooks for data fetching |
| lodash | Utility library for common programming tasks |
| uuid | Generating unique identifiers |

### peerDependencies
#### Description
Specifies the peer dependencies that the consuming project should have installed.

### devDependencies
#### Description
Lists the development dependencies used for building and testing the package.

## Dependencies
The package relies on several external libraries, including React, Recoil, and Socket.IO client for its core functionality.

## Configuration
The package is configured to be built using tsup, with both ESM and CJS output formats. It excludes React and Recoil from the bundle, expecting them to be provided by the consuming application.

## Error Handling
No specific error handling mechanisms are defined in this file.

## Logging

## API/Interface Reference
The main entry points for the package are specified as:
- Main: "dist/index.js"
- Module: "dist/index.mjs"
- Types: "dist/index.d.ts"

These files are generated during the build process and provide the public API for the package.
