## High-level description
This code provides utility functions for managing authentication tokens in a React application. It offers methods to get, set, and remove tokens from the browser's local storage, ensuring a consistent approach to token handling across the application.

## Symbols

### `tokenKey`
#### Description
A constant string that defines the key used to store and retrieve the token in local storage.

### `getToken()`
#### Description
Retrieves the authentication token from local storage.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| token | string \| undefined | The stored token, or undefined if not found or if an error occurs |

#### Internal Logic
- Attempts to retrieve the item with key `tokenKey` from local storage
- If successful, returns the token
- If an error occurs (e.g., local storage is not available), it catches the error and returns undefined

### `setToken(token: string)`
#### Description
Stores the provided authentication token in local storage.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| token | string | The token to be stored |

#### Internal Logic
- Attempts to set the item with key `tokenKey` and value `token` in local storage
- If an error occurs (e.g., local storage is not available), it catches the error and returns undefined

### `removeToken()`
#### Description
Removes the authentication token from local storage.

#### Internal Logic
- Attempts to remove the item with key `tokenKey` from local storage
- If an error occurs (e.g., local storage is not available), it catches the error and returns undefined

## Error Handling
All functions in this module use try-catch blocks to handle potential errors that may occur when interacting with local storage. This ensures that the application doesn't crash if local storage is unavailable or if there are permission issues.

## References
This module is used in other parts of the application, particularly:
1. In `libs/react-client/src/api/index.tsx`, the `removeToken()` function is imported and used in the error handling of the `APIBase` class.
2. In `libs/react-client/src/api/hooks/auth.ts`, all three functions (`getToken()`, `setToken()`, and `removeToken()`) are imported and used in the `useAuth` hook for managing authentication state.

## Dependencies
This module relies on the browser's `localStorage` API for persistent storage of the authentication token.

## Side Effects
The `setToken()` and `removeToken()` functions modify the browser's local storage, which persists across page reloads and browser sessions.

## Performance Considerations
Local storage operations are generally fast, but they are synchronous and can potentially block the main thread. However, the impact should be minimal for the small amount of data being stored and retrieved in this case.
