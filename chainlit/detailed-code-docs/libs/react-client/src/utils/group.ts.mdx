## High-level description
This code defines a utility function `groupByDate` that categorizes an array of `IThread` objects based on their creation dates. It groups the threads into categories like "Today", "Yesterday", "Previous 7 days", "Previous 30 days", or by month and year for older threads.

## Symbols

### `groupByDate`
#### Description
This function takes an array of `IThread` objects and groups them into categories based on their creation dates. It uses the `createdAt` property of each thread to determine its category.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| data | IThread[] | An array of thread objects to be grouped |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| groupedData | { [key: string]: IThread[] } | An object where keys are date categories and values are arrays of threads belonging to that category |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initialize an empty object `groupedData` to store the grouped threads.
2. Create `Date` objects for today, yesterday, 7 days ago, and 30 days ago.
3. Iterate through each thread in the input array:
   - Convert the thread's `createdAt` to a `Date` object.
   - Determine the appropriate category based on the creation date:
     - "Today" if created today
     - "Yesterday" if created yesterday
     - "Previous 7 days" if created within the last 7 days
     - "Previous 30 days" if created within the last 30 days
     - Month name for older threads
   - Add the thread to the appropriate category in `groupedData`.
4. Return the `groupedData` object.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| src/types | Imports the `IThread` interface used in the function signature |

## References
The `groupByDate` function is referenced in the `libs/react-client/src/state.ts` file, specifically in the `threadHistoryState` atom. It's used to update the `timeGroupedThreads` property of the thread history state when the threads change.

## Performance Considerations
The function iterates through the input array once, performing date comparisons for each thread. For large arrays, this could become a performance bottleneck. Consider memoizing the result or implementing pagination if dealing with a large number of threads.
