## High-level description
This code defines a custom React hook called `useChatSession` that manages the chat session state and provides methods for connecting to and interacting with a WebSocket-based chat server. It utilizes Recoil for state management and handles various socket events to update the chat state.

## Code Structure
The `useChatSession` hook uses several Recoil state atoms and selectors to manage the chat session state. It defines methods for connecting, disconnecting, and handling various socket events. The hook returns an object with the session state and methods for interacting with the chat session.

### useChatSession
#### Description
A custom React hook that manages the chat session state and provides methods for interacting with the chat server.

#### Inputs
This hook doesn't take any direct inputs, but it uses several Recoil states and the ChainlitContext.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| connect | Function | Establishes a connection to the WebSocket server |
| disconnect | Function | Disconnects from the WebSocket server |
| session | Object | The current session state |
| sessionId | string | The current session ID |
| chatProfile | string | The current chat profile |
| idToResume | string | The ID of the thread to resume |
| setChatProfile | Function | Sets the chat profile |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes various Recoil states and selectors.
2. Defines a `_connect` function that establishes a WebSocket connection and sets up event listeners for various socket events.
3. Uses `debounce` to create a `connect` function that prevents rapid consecutive connection attempts.
4. Defines a `disconnect` function to close the WebSocket connection.
5. Returns an object with the session state and methods for interacting with the chat session.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| lodash | Used for the `debounce` function |
| react | Core React library |
| recoil | State management library |
| socket.io-client | WebSocket client library |

## Error Handling
The code sets an error state in the session when a connection error occurs. It also handles various socket events that may indicate errors or issues with the chat session.

## Side Effects
The hook manages a WebSocket connection, which is a side effect. It establishes the connection, listens for events, and can modify the global state based on these events.

## Performance Considerations
The use of `debounce` on the `connect` function helps prevent excessive connection attempts in a short period, which could impact performance.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code.
