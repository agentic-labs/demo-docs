## High-level description
The `useAudio` hook in `useAudio.ts` provides functionality for audio recording and streaming in a React application. It manages the recording process, including starting, stopping, and cancelling recordings, as well as handling audio data chunks and sending them to a chat interaction system.

## Code Structure
The `useAudio` hook uses several React hooks (useState, useRef, useCallback) and the `useChatInteract` hook to manage the recording state and interact with the chat system. It returns an object with methods and state variables for controlling and monitoring the recording process.

## References
- `useChatInteract` hook from './useChatInteract'
- Types `IAudioConfig` and `IFileRef` from './types'

### `useAudio`
#### Description
A custom React hook that provides audio recording functionality with configurable options.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| config | IAudioConfig | Configuration options for audio recording (optional, default provided) |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| startRecording | Function | Starts the audio recording |
| stopRecording | Function | Stops the audio recording |
| cancelRecording | Function | Cancels the audio recording |
| isRecording | boolean | Indicates if recording is in progress |
| isSpeaking | boolean | Indicates if speech is detected |
| isRecordingFinished | boolean | Indicates if recording has finished |
| error | string \| undefined | Error message, if any |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes state variables and refs for managing recording state.
2. Defines functions for starting, stopping, and cancelling recordings.
3. In `startRecording`:
   - Sets up MediaRecorder and AudioContext for recording and audio analysis.
   - Implements logic for detecting speech and silence.
   - Sends audio chunks to the chat interaction system.
   - Handles recording timeouts and maximum duration.
4. Uses `useCallback` to memoize functions and prevent unnecessary re-renders.

## Side Effects
- Accesses the user's microphone through `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia`.
- Sends audio data to an external system using `sendAudioChunk` and `endAudioStream`.

#### Performance Considerations
- Uses `requestAnimationFrame` for efficient sound detection.
- Implements timeouts to limit recording duration and handle silence.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| React | Core library for the hook implementation |
| useChatInteract | Custom hook for chat interaction functionality |

### Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| enabled | boolean | true | Enables/disables audio recording |
| min_decibels | number | -45 | Minimum decibel level for sound detection |
| initial_silence_timeout | number | 3000 | Timeout for initial silence in milliseconds |
| silence_timeout | number | 1500 | Timeout for silence during recording in milliseconds |
| max_duration | number | 15000 | Maximum recording duration in milliseconds |
| chunk_duration | number | 1000 | Duration of each audio chunk in milliseconds |

## Error Handling
The hook captures and sets errors that occur during the recording process, making them available through the `error` state variable.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code.
