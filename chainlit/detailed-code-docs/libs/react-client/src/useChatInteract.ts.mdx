## High-level description
This code defines a custom React hook called `useChatInteract` that provides various functions for interacting with a chat interface. It manages chat-related state and actions such as sending messages, uploading files, and managing chat settings.

## Code Structure
The `useChatInteract` hook uses several Recoil atoms and selectors to manage state. It also utilizes the `ChainlitContext` to access the client API. The hook returns an object with multiple functions that allow interaction with the chat interface.

### useChatInteract
#### Description
A custom React hook that provides functions for interacting with a chat interface.

#### Inputs
This hook doesn't take any direct inputs, but it uses various Recoil states and the ChainlitContext.

#### Outputs
Returns an object containing several functions for chat interaction:

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| uploadFile | Function | Uploads a file to the server |
| callAction | Function | Calls an action on the server |
| clear | Function | Clears the chat session |
| replyMessage | Function | Replies to a message |
| sendMessage | Function | Sends a new message |
| editMessage | Function | Edits an existing message |
| sendAudioChunk | Function | Sends an audio chunk to the server |
| endAudioStream | Function | Ends the audio stream |
| stopTask | Function | Stops the current task |
| setIdToResume | Function | Sets the ID of the thread to resume |
| updateChatSettings | Function | Updates the chat settings |

#### Internal Logic
The hook uses various Recoil states to manage the chat state and provides functions to interact with these states. It also uses the ChainlitContext to make API calls to the server.

## Dependencies
- React (useCallback, useContext)
- Recoil (useRecoilValue, useResetRecoilState, useSetRecoilState)
- uuid (v4)
- Various Recoil atoms and selectors from 'src/state'
- ChainlitContext from './context'
- addMessage utility from 'src/utils/message'

## Side Effects
This hook has several side effects, including:
- Modifying Recoil state
- Making API calls to the server
- Emitting socket events

## Performance Considerations
The hook uses `useCallback` to memoize functions, which can help prevent unnecessary re-renders. However, the large number of state dependencies might cause frequent re-renders if not managed carefully.
