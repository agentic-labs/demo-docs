## High-level description
This file serves as a central export point for various type definitions used in the react-client library. It aggregates and re-exports types from multiple files, providing a convenient way to import these types throughout the project.

## Code Structure
The file consists of a series of export statements, each importing all exports from a specific type definition file. This structure allows for easy access to all types through a single import statement in other parts of the project.

### Export statements
#### Description
Each line in this file is an export statement that re-exports all the types defined in a specific file.

#### Internal Logic
The file uses the `export *` syntax to re-export all named exports from each imported file. This means that any type, interface, or other export defined in these files will be available when importing from this index file.

## Dependencies
This file depends on the following internal modules:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| './action' | Exports types related to actions |
| './element' | Exports types related to UI elements |
| './file' | Exports types related to file handling |
| './feedback' | Exports types related to user feedback |
| './step' | Exports types related to steps in a process |
| './user' | Exports types related to user information |
| './thread' | Exports types related to conversation threads |
| './history' | Exports types related to conversation history |
| './config' | Exports types related to configuration |

## References
This file serves as a central point of reference for other parts of the codebase that need to use these types. By importing from this file, other modules can access all the exported types without needing to import from multiple files individually.

Based on the related code snippets provided, here's a brief overview of the main types being exported:

1. From `action.ts`: `IAction`, `ICallFn`
2. From `element.ts`: Various element types like `IElement`, `IMessageElement`, `IImageElement`, etc.
3. From `file.ts`: `FileSpec`, `ActionSpec`, `IFileRef`, `IAsk`
4. From `feedback.ts`: `IFeedback`
5. From `step.ts`: `IStep`
6. From `user.ts`: `IUser`, `IUserMetadata`, `AuthProvider`
7. From `thread.ts`: `IThread`
8. From `history.ts`: `UserInput`, `ThreadHistory`
9. From `config.ts`: `IChainlitConfig`, `ChatProfile`, `IAudioConfig`, `IAuthConfig`, `IStarter`

These types cover various aspects of the application, including UI elements, user interactions, authentication, configuration, and data structures for managing conversations and history.
