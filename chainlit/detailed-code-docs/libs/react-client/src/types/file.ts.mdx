## High-level description
This file defines TypeScript interfaces for file-related operations in a React client application. It includes specifications for file uploads, actions, and user interactions, providing a structured way to handle file-related data and user inputs in the application.

## Symbols

### FileSpec
#### Description
An interface that defines the specifications for file uploads.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| accept | string[] \| Record&lt;string, string[]&gt; | Optional. Specifies the accepted file types. |
| max_size_mb | number | Optional. Maximum file size in megabytes. |
| max_files | number | Optional. Maximum number of files allowed. |

### ActionSpec
#### Description
An interface that defines the specifications for actions.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| keys | string[] | Optional. An array of keys associated with the action. |

### IFileRef
#### Description
An interface representing a reference to a file.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | string | The unique identifier of the file. |

### IAsk
#### Description
An interface defining the structure for user interactions or prompts.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| callback | (payload: IStep \| IFileRef[] \| IAction) =&gt; void | A function to handle the response to the prompt. |
| spec | Object | Specifications for the prompt. |
| spec.type | 'text' \| 'file' \| 'action' | The type of input expected. |
| spec.timeout | number | The timeout duration for the prompt. |

#### Internal Logic
The `spec` property combines properties from both `FileSpec` and `ActionSpec`, allowing for flexible configuration of the prompt based on its type.
