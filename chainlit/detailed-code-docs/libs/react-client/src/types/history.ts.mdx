## High-level description
This code defines TypeScript types and interfaces related to user input history and thread history in a chat application. It provides structures for storing and managing user inputs, chat threads, and pagination information.

## Symbols

### `UserInput`
#### Description
Represents a single user input in the chat history.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| content | string | The text content of the user input |
| createdAt | number | Timestamp of when the input was created |

### `ThreadHistory`
#### Description
Represents the history of chat threads, including current thread information and pagination details.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| threads | IThread[] | Optional. An array of thread objects |
| currentThreadId | string | Optional. The ID of the current active thread |
| timeGroupedThreads | { [key: string]: IThread[] } | Optional. Threads grouped by time periods |
| pageInfo | IPageInfo | Optional. Pagination information |

## References
- `IThread`: Imported from 'src/types', represents a chat thread
- `IPageInfo`: Imported from '..', represents pagination information

## Dependencies
The code relies on types defined in other files within the project, specifically `IThread` and `IPageInfo`.

## Notes
1. The `ThreadHistory` type is designed to be flexible, with all its properties being optional. This allows for partial updates and different states of the thread history.
2. The `timeGroupedThreads` property suggests that the application might display threads grouped by time periods (e.g., today, yesterday, last week) for easier navigation.
3. The inclusion of `pageInfo` indicates that the thread history supports pagination, which is useful for handling large numbers of threads efficiently.

This type definition file plays a crucial role in maintaining type safety and providing a clear structure for managing chat history and thread data throughout the application.
