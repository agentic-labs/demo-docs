## References
This interface is used in several other parts of the codebase:

1. It's imported in `libs/react-client/src/api/index.tsx` for API operations related to feedback.
2. It's used in `libs/react-client/src/types/step.ts` as part of the `IStep` interface.
3. It's utilized in various components for handling feedback operations, such as:
   - `frontend/src/components/organisms/sidebar/threadHistory/Thread.tsx`
   - `frontend/src/components/organisms/chat/Messages/index.tsx`
   - `frontend/src/components/organisms/chat/Messages/container.tsx`
   - `libs/copilot/src/chat/messages/container.tsx`
   - `libs/copilot/src/chat/messages/index.tsx`

These components use the `IFeedback` interface to type-check feedback-related operations, such as updating or deleting feedback, and to ensure consistent structure when working with feedback data throughout the application.
