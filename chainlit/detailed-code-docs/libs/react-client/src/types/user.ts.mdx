## High-level description
This file defines TypeScript types and interfaces related to user authentication and user data in a React client application. It specifies the possible authentication providers and structures for user metadata and user information.

## Symbols

### `AuthProvider`
#### Description
A type that defines the possible authentication providers for the application.

#### Inputs
This is a type definition, so it doesn't have inputs.

#### Outputs
The type can be one of the following string literals:
- `'credentials'`
- `'header'`
- `'github'`
- `'google'`
- `'azure-ad'`
- `'azure-ad-hybrid'`

### `IUserMetadata`
#### Description
An interface that extends `Record&lt;string, any&gt;` to define the structure of user metadata.

#### Properties
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| tags? | string[] | Optional array of tags associated with the user |
| image? | string | Optional URL or path to the user's profile image |
| provider? | AuthProvider | Optional authentication provider used by the user |

### `IUser`
#### Description
An interface that defines the structure of a user object.

#### Properties
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | string | Unique identifier for the user |
| identifier | string | A string used to identify the user (e.g., username or email) |
| display_name? | string | Optional display name for the user |
| metadata | IUserMetadata | User metadata object |

## References
This file is referenced in other parts of the codebase:

1. In `libs/react-client/src/state.ts`, the `IUser` interface is used in the `userState` atom definition:
   ```typescript
   export const userState = atom&lt;IUser | null&gt;({
     key: 'User',
     default: null
   });
   ```

2. In `libs/react-client/src/api/hooks/auth.ts`, the `IUser` interface is used in the `useAuth` hook:
   ```typescript
   setUser(User as IUser);
   ```

3. The types defined in this file are exported in `libs/react-client/src/types/index.ts`, making them available for use throughout the application.

## Dependencies
This file doesn't have any external dependencies. It only uses TypeScript's built-in types and features.

## Notes
- The `AuthProvider` type allows for easy extension of supported authentication methods in the future.
- The `IUserMetadata` interface is flexible, allowing for additional properties beyond the specified ones due to its extension of `Record&lt;string, any&gt;`.
- The `IUser` interface provides a standardized structure for user data across the application, ensuring consistency in how user information is handled.
