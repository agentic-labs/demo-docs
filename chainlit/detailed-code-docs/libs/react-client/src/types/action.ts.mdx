## High-level description
This code defines interfaces and types related to actions and function calls in a chat or messaging application. It provides structures for representing actions that can be performed within the application and for defining function calls with callbacks.

## Symbols

### `IAction`
#### Description
An interface that defines the structure of an action in the application.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| description | string (optional) | A description of the action |
| forId | string | An identifier for the target of the action |
| id | string | A unique identifier for the action |
| label | string (optional) | A label for the action |
| name | string | The name of the action |
| onClick | () =&gt; void | A function to be called when the action is triggered |
| value | string | The value associated with the action |
| collapsed | boolean | Indicates whether the action is collapsed or expanded |

### `ICallFn`
#### Description
An interface that defines the structure of a function call with a callback.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
| callback | (payload: Record&lt;string, any&gt;) =&gt; void | A function to be called with the payload |
| name | string | The name of the function |
| args | Record&lt;string, any&gt; | Arguments to be passed to the function |

## References
This code is referenced and used in various parts of the application, including:
- Message components (`MessageActions.tsx`, `ActionButton.tsx`, `ActionDrawerButton.tsx`)
- Chat interaction hooks (`useChatInteract.ts`)
- Message containers (`MessageContainer.tsx`)

## Dependencies
This code doesn't directly import any external libraries, but it is used in conjunction with React and other application-specific components and hooks.

## Notes
- The `IAction` interface is used extensively throughout the application to represent clickable actions in messages and other UI components.
- The `ICallFn` interface is likely used for handling asynchronous operations or callbacks in the chat application.
- These interfaces play a crucial role in structuring the data and behavior of interactive elements in the chat interface.
