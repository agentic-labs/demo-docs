## High-level description
This code defines the `IThread` interface in TypeScript, which represents a thread of conversation or interaction in a chat-like application. It includes properties for identifying and describing the thread, as well as arrays for steps and elements within the thread.

### `IThread`
#### Description
The `IThread` interface defines the structure of a thread object, which represents a conversation or interaction sequence in the application.

#### Properties
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | string | Unique identifier for the thread |
| createdAt | number \| string | Timestamp of when the thread was created |
| name | string? | Optional name for the thread |
| userId | string? | Optional identifier for the user associated with the thread |
| userIdentifier | string? | Optional alternative identifier for the user |
| metadata | Record&lt;string, any&gt;? | Optional key-value pairs for additional metadata |
| steps | IStep[] | Array of steps (messages or actions) in the thread |
| elements | IElement[]? | Optional array of elements associated with the thread |

## References
- `IElement`: Imported from './element', represents various types of elements that can be associated with a thread.
- `IStep`: Imported from './step', represents individual steps or messages within a thread.

## Dependencies
The `IThread` interface depends on two other interfaces:
1. `IElement` from './element'
2. `IStep` from './step'

These dependencies suggest that the thread structure is closely related to the concepts of steps and elements in the application.

## Usage Context
Based on the related code snippets provided, the `IThread` interface is used in various parts of the application:

1. In the API client (`ChainlitAPI` class) for operations like listing threads and deleting threads.
2. In the thread history component for displaying and managing thread information.
3. In utility functions like `groupByDate` for organizing threads by their creation date.

The interface plays a central role in representing conversation or interaction data throughout the application, serving as a core data structure for managing and displaying chat-like interactions.
