## High-level description
The `useChatData` hook is a custom React hook that provides access to various chat-related data and states from the Recoil state management system. It consolidates multiple pieces of chat data into a single, easily accessible object, making it convenient for components to access and use this data.

## Code Structure
The `useChatData` hook uses the `useRecoilValue` hook from Recoil to access multiple atoms and selectors. It then combines these values into a single object that is returned by the hook.
