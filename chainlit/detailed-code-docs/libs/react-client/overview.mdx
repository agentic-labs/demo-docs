## High-level description
The `libs/react-client` directory contains a React-based client library for interacting with Chainlit applications. It provides a set of React hooks, utilities, and an API client to manage chat sessions, messages, and various chat-related functionalities. The library is designed to be integrated into any React application to facilitate communication with a Chainlit server.

## What does it do?
This library enables developers to:
1. Establish and manage WebSocket connections to a Chainlit server
2. Send and receive chat messages in real-time
3. Handle chat-related data such as actions, avatars, and elements
4. Manage chat settings and user interactions
5. Record and stream audio
6. Upload files
7. Implement authentication and token management
8. Access and modify chat configurations

The library uses Recoil for state management, providing a seamless way to handle complex state interactions across different components of a chat application.

## Key Files
1. `src/api/index.tsx`: Defines the core `ChainlitAPI` client for server interactions.
2. `src/useChatInteract.ts`: Provides functions for chat interactions like sending messages and uploading files.
3. `src/useChatData.ts`: Offers access to chat-related data from the Recoil state.
4. `src/useChatSession.ts`: Manages WebSocket connections and chat session state.
5. `src/useAudio.ts`: Handles audio recording and streaming functionality.
6. `src/useConfig.ts`: Manages and provides access to the Chainlit configuration.
7. `src/state.ts`: Contains Recoil atoms and selectors for managing application state.
8. `src/types/`: Directory with TypeScript type definitions for various aspects of the chat application.
9. `src/utils/`: Directory containing utility functions for data grouping, message handling, and token management.

## Dependencies
The library relies on several key dependencies:
- react: Core library for building the user interface
- recoil: State management library
- socket.io-client: WebSocket client for real-time communication
- swr: Data fetching and caching library
- lodash: Utility functions library
- uuid: For generating unique identifiers
- jwt-decode: For decoding JSON Web Tokens

## Configuration
The library can be configured through various options, including:
1. API Configuration: Base URL and application type
2. Authentication Configuration: Login requirements and methods
3. Audio Configuration: Settings for audio recording and processing
4. Chat Settings: Configurable inputs and default values for chat behavior

These configurations are managed through Recoil states and can be accessed and modified using the provided hooks.

The TypeScript configuration (`tsconfig.json`) is set up to ensure type safety and proper module resolution. It specifies compiler options for strict type-checking, React JSX support, and module resolution using Node.js-style.

To use this library, developers need to wrap their application in a Recoil provider and a ChainlitContext provider, as shown in the README example:

```tsx
import { RecoilRoot } from 'recoil';
import { ChainlitAPI, ChainlitContext } from '@chainlit/react-client';

const CHAINLIT_SERVER_URL = 'http://localhost:8000';
const apiClient = new ChainlitAPI(CHAINLIT_SERVER_URL, 'webapp');

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root') as HTMLElement).render(
  &lt;React.StrictMode&gt;
    &lt;ChainlitContext.Provider value={apiClient}&gt;
      &lt;RecoilRoot&gt;
        &lt;MyApp /&gt;
      &lt;/RecoilRoot&gt;
    &lt;/ChainlitContext.Provider&gt;
  &lt;/React.StrictMode&gt;
);
```

This setup allows developers to use the provided hooks and utilities throughout their application to interact with the Chainlit server and manage chat-related functionalities.
