### `IWidgetConfig`
#### Description
An interface that defines the configuration options for the Chainlit copilot widget.

#### Properties
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| chainlitServer | string | The URL of the Chainlit server |
| showCot | boolean (optional) | Whether to show the chain of thought |
| accessToken | string (optional) | Authentication token for accessing the server |
| theme | 'light' \| 'dark' (optional) | The theme of the widget |
| fontFamily | string (optional) | The font family to be used in the widget |
| button | object (optional) | Configuration for the widget button |

#### Internal Logic
The `button` property is an optional nested object with its own set of properties:

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| containerId | string (optional) | ID of the container element for the button |
| imageUrl | string (optional) | URL of the image to be used for the button |
| style | object (optional) | Styling options for the button |

The `style` property of the `button` object includes various optional CSS-like properties such as `size`, `width`, `height`, `bgcolor`, `color`, `bgcolorHover`, `borderColor`, `borderWidth`, `borderStyle`, `borderRadius`, and `boxShadow`.

## References
This interface is used in several other parts of the application:

1. In `appWrapper.tsx`, it's used as a prop type for the `AppWrapper` component.
2. In `widget.tsx`, it's used to type the `config` prop of the `Widget` component.
3. In `app.tsx`, it's used as a prop type for the `App` component.
4. In `index.tsx`, it's used to type the parameter of the `mountChainlitWidget` function.

These references indicate that the `IWidgetConfig` interface is central to configuring the widget's appearance and behavior throughout the application.

## Dependencies
This file doesn't have any external dependencies. It's a pure TypeScript interface definition.

## Configuration
The `IWidgetConfig` interface itself serves as a configuration schema for the widget. It allows users of the widget to customize various aspects of its appearance and behavior by providing values for the defined properties.
