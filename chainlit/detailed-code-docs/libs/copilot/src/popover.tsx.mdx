## High-level description
This code defines a `PopOver` component in React, which creates a customizable pop-over element using Material-UI components. The pop-over contains a chat interface and can be expanded or collapsed. It is designed to be used as part of a larger widget or application, likely for a chatbot or similar interactive feature.

## Code Structure
The `PopOver` component is the main export of this file. It uses several Material-UI components (`Popper`, `Fade`, `Box`) to create the pop-over structure. The component also imports and renders a `Header` component and a `Chat` component, suggesting a modular design for the chat interface.

## Symbols

### PopOver
#### Description
A functional React component that renders a pop-over containing a chat interface. It can be expanded or collapsed and is positioned relative to an anchor element.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| anchorEl | HTMLElement \| null | The DOM element to which the pop-over is anchored |
| buttonHeight | string | The height of the button that triggers the pop-over |

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses the `useState` hook to manage the `expanded` state of the pop-over.
2. Renders a `Popper` component from Material-UI, which is configured with various style properties.
3. Inside the `Popper`, it renders a `Fade` component for animation, containing a `Box` with the `Header` and `Chat` components.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react | For using React hooks and components |
| @mui/material | For using Material-UI components (Box, Fade, Popper) |
| components/Header | Custom header component for the pop-over |
| chat | Custom chat component for the pop-over content |

## References
The `PopOver` component is likely used in the `Widget` component from the related `widget.tsx` file. The `Header` component used in `PopOver` is defined in the related `Header.tsx` file.

## Performance Considerations
The use of `Fade` for animation and the dynamic sizing based on the `expanded` state may have minor performance implications, especially on lower-end devices. However, these are likely negligible for most use cases.

## Side Effects
The component doesn't have any notable side effects beyond rendering to the DOM and managing its own state.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code.
