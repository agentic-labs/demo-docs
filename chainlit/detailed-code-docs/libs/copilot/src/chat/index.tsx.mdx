## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `ChatWrapper` that serves as the main wrapper for a chat interface. It manages the chat session, handles message sending, and renders the chat body. The component utilizes hooks from the `@chainlit/react-client` library to interact with the chat functionality.

## Code Structure
The `ChatWrapper` component uses the `WidgetContext` to access the `accessToken`. It then uses the `useChatSession` and `useChatInteract` hooks to manage the chat session and interaction. The component establishes a connection to the chat server and sets up a global function for sending messages. Finally, it renders the `ChatBody` component.

### ChatWrapper
#### Description
This is the main functional component that wraps the chat interface. It manages the chat session connection and sets up the global message sending function.

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the `accessToken` from the `WidgetContext`.
2. Uses the `useChatSession` hook to get the `connect` function and `session` object.
3. Uses the `useChatInteract` hook to get the `sendMessage` function.
4. Sets up an effect to connect to the chat server when the component mounts or when the `accessToken` changes.
5. Sets up another effect to attach the `sendMessage` function to the global `window` object.
6. Renders the `ChatBody` component.

## Side Effects
1. Connects to the chat server when the component mounts or when the `accessToken` changes.
2. Attaches the `sendMessage` function to the global `window` object as `window.sendChainlitMessage`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @chainlit/react-client | Provides hooks for chat session management and interaction |
| react | Core React library for building the component |

## Error Handling
The code does not implement explicit error handling. However, the `useChatSession` hook likely handles connection errors internally.

## API/Interface Reference
The component exposes the following global function:
| Function | Description |
|:---------|:------------|
| window.sendChainlitMessage | Allows sending messages to the chat from outside the React component tree |

## TODOs
There is a TODO in the form of a TypeScript error suppression:
```typescript
// @ts-expect-error is not a valid prop
window.sendChainlitMessage = sendMessage;
```
This suggests that the global `window` object type definition should be extended to include the `sendChainlitMessage` property.
