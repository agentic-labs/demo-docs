## High-level description
The `ElementSideView` component is a reusable React component that renders a side view for displaying various types of elements (e.g., images, text, files) in a modal-like interface. It provides a sliding panel that appears from the bottom of the screen, containing the element's content and a close button.

## Code Structure
The component is composed of two main parts: an overlay (`Box`) that covers the screen when the side view is open, and a content container (`Box`) that slides up from the bottom. The content includes a header with the element's name and a close button, followed by the actual element content rendered using the `Element` component.

### ElementSideView
#### Description
A functional React component that renders a side view for displaying element content.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| element | IMessageElement | The element to be displayed in the side view |
| isOpen | boolean | Determines whether the side view is open or closed |
| onClose | () =&gt; void | Function to be called when closing the side view |

#### Internal Logic
1. Renders an overlay `Box` that covers the screen when `isOpen` is true.
2. Renders a content container `Box` that slides up from the bottom when `isOpen` is true.
3. Displays the element's name in a `Typography` component.
4. Provides a close button using an `IconButton` with a `Close` icon.
5. Renders the element content using the `Element` component.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @mui/icons-material | Provides the Close icon for the close button |
| @mui/material | Provides UI components (Box, IconButton, Stack, Typography) |
| @chainlit/app/src/components/atoms/elements/Element | Renders the actual element content |
| @chainlit/react-client/src/types | Provides the IMessageElement type |

## Performance Considerations
The component uses CSS transitions for smooth opening and closing animations. The `visibility` and `opacity` properties are used to control the appearance of the overlay and content container, which should provide good performance for showing/hiding the side view.

___

This component is designed to be flexible and reusable, allowing for the display of various types of elements in a consistent side view interface. It integrates well with Material-UI components and follows React best practices for prop handling and component composition.
