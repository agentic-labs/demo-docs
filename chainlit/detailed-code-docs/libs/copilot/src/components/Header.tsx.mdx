## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `Header` for a chat application. It renders a header bar with a logo, an expand/minimize button, chat profiles, and a new chat button. The component is designed to be part of a larger chat interface, likely within a popover or modal.

## Code Structure
The `Header` component is a functional component that takes two props: `expanded` and `setExpanded`. It uses Material-UI components for layout and styling, and imports custom components and icons from other parts of the application.

## Symbols

### Header
#### Description
The `Header` component renders a horizontal bar with various elements for a chat interface.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| expanded | boolean | Indicates whether the chat interface is expanded or minimized |
| setExpanded | function | A function to toggle the expanded state |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSX.Element | React component | The rendered header component |

#### Internal Logic
The component uses Material-UI's `Stack` component to create a horizontal layout with two main sections:
1. Left section: Contains the logo and an expand/minimize button
2. Right section: Contains chat profiles and a new chat button

The expand/minimize button toggles between `MinimizeIcon` and `ExpandIcon` based on the `expanded` prop.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @mui/material | Provides UI components like Stack and IconButton |
| @chainlit/app | Provides custom icons and components |

## References
- `Logo`: A custom component for displaying the application logo
- `ChatProfiles`: A custom component for managing chat profiles
- `NewChatButton`: A custom component for creating a new chat

## Side Effects
The component doesn't have any side effects beyond updating the UI based on the `expanded` prop and calling the `setExpanded` function when the expand/minimize button is clicked.

## Performance Considerations
This component is relatively lightweight and doesn't have any significant performance considerations. However, it's worth noting that the `ChatProfiles` and `NewChatButton` components are imported and rendered, which may have their own performance implications depending on their implementation.
