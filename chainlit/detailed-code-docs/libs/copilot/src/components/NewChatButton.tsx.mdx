## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `NewChatButton` that renders a button to start a new chat. When clicked, it opens a dialog to confirm the action. Upon confirmation, it clears the current chat and closes the dialog.

## Code Structure
The `NewChatButton` component uses React hooks and Material-UI components to manage its state and render the UI. It also utilizes the `useChatInteract` hook from the Chainlit React client for chat-related functionality.
