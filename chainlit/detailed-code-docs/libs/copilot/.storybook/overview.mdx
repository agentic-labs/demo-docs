## High-level description
This directory contains configuration files for Storybook, a development environment for UI components. It is specifically set up for a React project using Vite as the build tool. The configuration files define how Storybook should operate within the project, including story file locations, addons, framework settings, and preview parameters.

## What does it do?
The configuration in this directory sets up Storybook to:

1. Locate and display story files from specific locations in the project.
2. Enhance Storybook's functionality with various addons like links, essentials, onboarding, and interactions.
3. Use React with Vite as the framework for building and displaying components.
4. Configure documentation options for automatic generation.
5. Set up global parameters for actions and controls, improving the interactivity of stories.
6. Automatically infer action argTypes for props starting with "on" followed by an uppercase letter.
7. Define matchers for color and date controls to enhance the customization of stories.

This setup allows developers to create, view, and interact with UI components in isolation, making it easier to develop and test components independently of the main application.

## Key Files

### main.ts
This file is the primary configuration file for Storybook. It exports a `StorybookConfig` object that defines:

- Story file patterns: `['../stories/**/*.mdx', '../stories/**/*.stories.@(js|jsx|mjs|ts|tsx)']`
- Addons: `['@storybook/addon-links', '@storybook/addon-essentials', '@storybook/addon-onboarding', '@storybook/addon-interactions']`
- Framework: React with Vite
- Documentation options: `{ autodocs: 'tag' }`

Example snippet:

```typescript
import type { StorybookConfig } from '@storybook/react-vite';

const config: StorybookConfig = {
  stories: ['../stories/**/*.mdx', '../stories/**/*.stories.@(js|jsx|mjs|ts|tsx)'],
  addons: [
    '@storybook/addon-links',
    '@storybook/addon-essentials',
    '@storybook/addon-onboarding',
    '@storybook/addon-interactions',
  ],
  framework: {
    name: '@storybook/react-vite',
    options: {},
  },
  docs: {
    autodocs: 'tag',
  },
};

export default config;
```

### preview.ts
This file configures the preview settings for Storybook. It exports a `Preview` object that sets up global parameters for actions and controls:

- Actions: Configures automatic inference of action argTypes
- Controls: Defines matchers for color and date controls

Example snippet:

```typescript
import type { Preview } from '@storybook/react';

const preview: Preview = {
  parameters: {
    actions: { argTypesRegex: '^on[A-Z].*' },
    controls: {
      matchers: {
        color: /(background|color)$/i,
        date: /Date$/i,
      },
    },
  },
};

export default preview;
```

## Dependencies
The configuration files rely on the following key dependencies:

1. @storybook/react-vite (version not specified)
   - Purpose: Provides the Storybook integration for React projects using Vite as the build tool.
   - Chosen for its compatibility with React and Vite, offering a streamlined development experience.

2. @storybook/react (version not specified)
   - Purpose: Provides type definitions and core functionality for Storybook with React.
   - Essential for setting up Storybook in a React project.

3. Various Storybook addons:
   - @storybook/addon-links
   - @storybook/addon-essentials
   - @storybook/addon-onboarding
   - @storybook/addon-interactions
   - Purpose: Enhance Storybook's functionality with additional features like linking stories, essential UI components, onboarding guides, and interaction testing.
   - Chosen to provide a comprehensive set of tools for component development and testing.

## Configuration
The configuration is primarily defined in the `main.ts` and `preview.ts` files. Key configurable fields include:

1. In `main.ts`:
   - `stories`: Array of file patterns for story files
   - `addons`: Array of Storybook addons to be used
   - `framework`: Object specifying the Storybook framework (React with Vite)
   - `docs`: Object configuring documentation options

2. In `preview.ts`:
   - `actions.argTypesRegex`: Regex pattern for inferring action argTypes (default: `'^on[A-Z].*'`)
   - `controls.matchers.color`: Regex for matching color controls (default: `/(background|color)$/i`)
   - `controls.matchers.date`: Regex for matching date controls (default: `/Date$/i`)

These configurations can be adjusted to customize Storybook's behavior, such as changing the location of story files, adding or removing addons, or modifying how controls and actions are inferred and displayed in the Storybook interface.
