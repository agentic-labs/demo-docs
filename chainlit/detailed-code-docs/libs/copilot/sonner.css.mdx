## High-level description
This CSS file defines the styling for a toast notification system, likely part of a UI library or framework called Sonner. It provides comprehensive styles for toast notifications, including layout, positioning, animations, and theming support for both light and dark modes.

## Code Structure
The CSS is organized into several main sections:
1. Direction-specific styles (LTR and RTL)
2. Toast container styles
3. Individual toast styles
4. Responsive styles for mobile devices
5. Theme-specific styles (light and dark)
6. Rich color styles for different toast types
7. Loading spinner styles

## Symbols

### `:where([data-sonner-toaster])`
#### Description
Defines the main container for all toast notifications.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets fixed positioning
- Defines custom properties for colors and dimensions
- Sets z-index to ensure toasts appear above other content

### `:where([data-sonner-toast])`
#### Description
Styles individual toast notifications.

#### Internal Logic
- Handles positioning and animations
- Sets up transitions for smooth appearance and disappearance
- Manages hover and focus states

### `[data-sonner-toaster][data-theme='light']` and `[data-sonner-toaster][data-theme='dark']`
#### Description
Defines color schemes for light and dark themes.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets custom properties for background, border, and text colors for different toast types (normal, success, info, warning, error)

### `.sonner-loading-wrapper` and related classes
#### Description
Styles for the loading spinner animation.

#### Internal Logic
- Creates a 12-bar spinning animation
- Handles visibility states

## Dependencies
This CSS file doesn't explicitly depend on external libraries, but it's designed to work with a JavaScript implementation that handles the dynamic aspects of the toast system.

## Configuration
The CSS uses custom properties extensively, allowing for easy customization of colors, dimensions, and animations.

## Performance Considerations
- Uses CSS transitions and animations for smooth visual effects
- Implements `@media (prefers-reduced-motion)` query to respect user preferences for reduced motion

## API/Interface Reference
While this is a CSS file and doesn't define an API directly, it expects certain data attributes to be present on HTML elements:
- `data-sonner-toaster`: The main container
- `data-sonner-toast`: Individual toast elements
- `data-type`: Toast type (success, info, warning, error)
- `data-y-position`: Vertical position (top, bottom)
- `data-x-position`: Horizontal position (left, right, center)
- `data-theme`: Color theme (light, dark)

These attributes are likely set by the accompanying JavaScript library to control the appearance and behavior of toasts.
