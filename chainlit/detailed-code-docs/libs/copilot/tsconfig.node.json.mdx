## High-level description
This file is a TypeScript configuration file (`tsconfig.node.json`) specifically for Node.js environment in the context of a Copilot-related project. It sets up compiler options for TypeScript and specifies which files to include in the compilation process.

## Symbols

### CompilerOptions
#### Description
The `compilerOptions` object in this configuration file defines specific settings for the TypeScript compiler when compiling TypeScript code for a Node.js environment.

#### Internal Logic
The compiler options are set as follows:
- `composite`: Set to `true`, enabling project references and incremental builds.
- `module`: Set to `"ESNext"`, specifying the latest ECMAScript module syntax.
- `moduleResolution`: Set to `"Node"`, using Node.js-style module resolution.
- `allowSyntheticDefaultImports`: Set to `true`, allowing default imports from modules with no default export.

### Include
#### Description
The `include` array specifies which files should be included in the compilation process.

#### Internal Logic
Only one file is included in this configuration:
- `"vite.config.ts"`: This suggests that the project is using Vite as its build tool, and this configuration is specifically set up to compile the Vite configuration file.

## Dependencies
This configuration file indirectly implies the use of the following tools and frameworks:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| TypeScript | The programming language and compiler for which this configuration is written |
| Node.js | The runtime environment for which this configuration is tailored |
| Vite | The build tool whose configuration file is included in this setup |

Note: These dependencies are inferred from the configuration and are not directly listed in the file.
