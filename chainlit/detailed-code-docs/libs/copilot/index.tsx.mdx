## High-level description
This code defines a widget for Chainlit, a copilot-like interface. It sets up a React application within a shadow DOM, allowing the widget to be embedded in various web environments without style conflicts. The widget can be mounted, unmounted, and used to send messages.

## Code Structure
The main symbols in this code are global functions (`mountChainlitWidget`, `unmountChainlitWidget`, `sendChainlitMessage`) that interact with the React application. These functions are added to the global `window` object, allowing external scripts to control the widget.

## Symbols

### `mountChainlitWidget`
#### Description
This function mounts the Chainlit widget to the DOM and renders the React application.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| config | IWidgetConfig | Configuration options for the widget |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a container div and appends it to the document body
2. Creates a shadow DOM within the container
3. Sets up an Emotion cache for CSS-in-JS
4. Renders the React application within the shadow DOM

### `unmountChainlitWidget`
#### Description
This function unmounts the Chainlit widget, removing it from the DOM.

#### Internal Logic
Calls the `unmount` method on the React root if it exists.

### `sendChainlitMessage`
#### Description
This function is a placeholder for sending messages to the Chainlit widget. In this implementation, it only logs a console message indicating that the copilot is not active.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @emotion/cache | For creating a CSS-in-JS cache |
| @emotion/react | For using Emotion's CSS-in-JS solution |
| react | Core React library |
| react-dom/client | For rendering React in the browser |
| @chainlit/app | For importing CSS styles |
| @chainlit/react-client | For importing IStep interface |
| highlight.js | For syntax highlighting styles |
| ./src/appWrapper | For the main application component |
| ./src/types | For importing IWidgetConfig interface |

## Configuration
The widget can be configured using the `IWidgetConfig` interface, which is passed to the `mountChainlitWidget` function. This includes options for the Chainlit server, access token, theme, and button styling.

## Side Effects
- Modifies the global `window` object by adding three new functions.
- Creates and manipulates DOM elements when mounting the widget.

## Performance Considerations
The use of a shadow DOM helps isolate the widget's styles from the rest of the page, potentially improving performance by reducing style recalculations.

## TODOs
The `sendChainlitMessage` function is currently a placeholder and needs to be implemented to actually send messages when the widget is active.
