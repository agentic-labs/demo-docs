title: "tsconfig.json"

## High-level description
This file is a TypeScript configuration file (tsconfig.json) for a project, likely a React application using ESNext features. It sets up various compiler options to ensure type safety, module resolution, and compatibility with modern JavaScript features.

## Configuration
The tsconfig.json file contains various configuration options for the TypeScript compiler. Here's a breakdown of the key settings:

| Option | Type | Value | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------|:------------|
| target | string | "ESNext" | Specifies the ECMAScript target version for the compiled JavaScript. |
| useDefineForClassFields | boolean | true | Enables the use of the `define` keyword for class fields. |
| lib | array | ["DOM", "DOM.Iterable", "ESNext"] | Specifies the library files to be included in the compilation. |
| baseUrl | string | "./src" | Sets the base directory for resolving non-relative module names. |
| allowJs | boolean | false | Disallows JavaScript files from being compiled. |
| skipLibCheck | boolean | true | Skips type checking of declaration files. |
| esModuleInterop | boolean | false | Disables additional JavaScript emit to ease interop with CommonJS modules. |
| allowSyntheticDefaultImports | boolean | true | Allows default imports from modules with no default export. |
| strict | boolean | true | Enables all strict type checking options. |
| strictNullChecks | boolean | true | Enables strict null checks. |
| forceConsistentCasingInFileNames | boolean | true | Ensures consistent casing in file names. |
| module | string | "ESNext" | Specifies the module code generation method. |
| moduleResolution | string | "Node" | Specifies the module resolution strategy. |
| resolveJsonModule | boolean | true | Allows importing .json files. |
| isolatedModules | boolean | true | Ensures each file can be safely transpiled without relying on other imports. |
| noEmit | boolean | true | Does not emit compiler output files like JavaScript source code, source-maps or declarations. |
| jsx | string | "react-jsx" | Specifies the JSX code generation for React components. |
| types | array | ["node"] | Specifies type declaration files to be included in compilation. |

The configuration also includes:

- `include`: Specifies the files to be included in the compilation. In this case, it includes all files in the "./src" and "./stories" directories.
- `references`: Refers to other related TypeScript projects. Here, it references the "tsconfig.node.json" file.

This configuration sets up a strict TypeScript environment suitable for a modern React application, with a focus on type safety and compatibility with the latest ECMAScript features.
