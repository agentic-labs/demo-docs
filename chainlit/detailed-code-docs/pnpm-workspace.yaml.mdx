title: "pnpm-workspace.yaml"
---

## High-level description
This `pnpm-workspace.yaml` file defines the workspace configuration for a pnpm-based monorepo project. It specifies the locations of packages within the project structure, enabling efficient management and sharing of dependencies across multiple packages.

## Code Structure
The file contains a single `packages` key with an array of package locations.

## Symbols

### packages
#### Description
The `packages` key is an array that lists the directories containing the project's packages. Each entry represents a relative path to a package within the monorepo.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| - | Array of strings | Each string is a relative path to a package directory |

#### Internal Logic
The workspace includes four packages:
1. `frontend/`: Likely contains the main frontend application code.
2. `libs/react-components/`: Probably houses reusable React components.
3. `libs/react-client/`: Might contain React-specific client-side logic or utilities.
4. `libs/copilot/`: Possibly contains code related to a copilot feature, as seen in the related code snippet.

## Dependencies
This configuration file doesn't directly specify dependencies, but it defines the structure for managing dependencies across the workspace.

## Configuration
The `pnpm-workspace.yaml` file itself serves as a configuration for the pnpm workspace. It tells pnpm which directories should be treated as packages within the monorepo.

## API/Interface Reference
While not an API in the traditional sense, this file defines the structure that pnpm will use to manage the workspace:

| Package Path | Description |
|:-------------|:------------|
| frontend/ | Main frontend application |
| libs/react-components/ | Reusable React components library |
| libs/react-client/ | React-specific client-side library |
| libs/copilot/ | Copilot feature library |

Note: The exact purpose of each package is inferred from common naming conventions and the related code snippet provided. The actual content and purpose of each package may vary.
