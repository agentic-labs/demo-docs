## High-level description
This file configures Vite and Vitest for a React project using TypeScript. It sets up the development environment, testing framework, and necessary plugins for the frontend application.

## Symbols

### `defineConfig`
#### Description
This function from Vite is used to define the configuration object for the project. It provides type checking and autocompletion for the configuration options.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| config | Object | Configuration object for Vite |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| config | Object | Processed configuration object |

### Configuration Object
#### Description
The configuration object passed to `defineConfig` sets up the project's build and test environment.

#### Internal Logic
1. Configures plugins:
   - `tsconfigPaths()`: Allows using path aliases defined in tsconfig.json
   - `react()`: Adds React-specific optimizations and features
2. Sets up test configuration:
   - Uses 'jsdom' as the testing environment
   - Specifies a setup file for tests
   - Defines patterns for including test files

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @vitejs/plugin-react-swc | Provides React support with SWC for faster builds |
| vite | Build tool and development server |
| vite-tsconfig-paths | Resolves TypeScript path aliases |
| vitest | Testing framework compatible with Vite |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| plugins | Array | [tsconfigPaths(), react()] | Vite plugins to use |
| test.environment | String | 'jsdom' | Testing environment |
| test.setupFiles | String | './tests/setup-tests.ts' | Setup file for tests |
| test.include | Array | ['./**/*.{test,spec}.?(c|m)[jt]s?(x)'] | Patterns for test files |

## API/Interface Reference
| Option | Description |
|:-------|:------------|
| plugins | Array of Vite plugins to enhance the build process |
| test | Configuration object for Vitest |
| test.environment | Specifies the testing environment (jsdom for browser-like environment) |
| test.setupFiles | Path to the setup file for tests |
| test.include | Glob patterns for identifying test files |

This configuration sets up a React project with TypeScript support, using Vite as the build tool and Vitest for testing. It enables the use of TypeScript path aliases, configures the React plugin for optimal performance, and sets up a browser-like testing environment with jsdom. The setup file for tests is specified, and test file patterns are defined to include various file extensions and naming conventions commonly used for tests.
