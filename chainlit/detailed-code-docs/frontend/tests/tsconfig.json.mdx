title: "tsconfig.json"
---

## High-level description
This file is a TypeScript configuration file (`tsconfig.json`) specifically for the frontend tests. It extends the main TypeScript configuration and adds additional settings for testing purposes, including type definitions for Jest and Testing Library.

## Code Structure
The configuration file consists of a single JSON object with three main properties: `extends`, `compilerOptions`, and `include`.

## Symbols

### Root Configuration Object
#### Description
The root configuration object defines the TypeScript compiler options and file inclusion rules for the frontend tests.

#### Internal Logic
1. Extends the main TypeScript configuration from the parent directory.
2. Specifies additional compiler options for testing.
3. Defines which files should be included in the compilation process for tests.

### `extends`
#### Description
This property specifies that this configuration extends another TypeScript configuration file.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| extends | string | Path to the base configuration file |

#### Internal Logic
The value `"../tsconfig.json"` indicates that this configuration extends the `tsconfig.json` file located in the parent directory. This allows the test configuration to inherit settings from the main frontend TypeScript configuration while adding or overriding specific options for testing.

### `compilerOptions`
#### Description
This property specifies compiler options specific to the test environment.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| types | string[] | Array of type definition files to include |

#### Internal Logic
The `types` array includes two entries:
1. `"jest"`: Adds type definitions for Jest, the testing framework.
2. `"testing-library__jest-dom"`: Adds type definitions for the Jest DOM extensions provided by Testing Library.

These type definitions allow TypeScript to recognize and provide intellisense for Jest and Testing Library functions and matchers in the test files.

### `include`
#### Description
This property specifies which files should be included in the compilation process for tests.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| include | string[] | Array of file glob patterns to include |

#### Internal Logic
The single entry `"**/*.spec.tsx"` indicates that all files ending with `.spec.tsx` in any subdirectory of the current directory should be included in the compilation process. This pattern typically matches test files for React components written in TypeScript.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Jest | JavaScript testing framework |
| Testing Library | Provides additional DOM testing utilities for Jest |

Note: These dependencies are implied by the type definitions included in the configuration.

By using this configuration, the TypeScript compiler will be able to properly type-check and compile the frontend test files, ensuring that they have access to the necessary type definitions for Jest and Testing Library while inheriting the main TypeScript configuration from the parent directory.
