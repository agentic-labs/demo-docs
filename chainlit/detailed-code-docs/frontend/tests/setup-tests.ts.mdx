## High-level description
This file sets up the testing environment for a React application using Vitest as the test runner. It extends Jest matchers with custom DOM-related matchers and ensures cleanup after each test.

## Symbols

### `expect.extend(matchers)`
#### Description
Extends the default Vitest `expect` function with additional matchers from the `@testing-library/jest-dom` library. These matchers provide custom assertions for testing DOM elements.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| matchers | object | An object containing custom matchers from `@testing-library/jest-dom` |

#### Side Effects
Modifies the global `expect` function by adding new matchers, enhancing the ability to make assertions about DOM elements in tests.

### `afterEach(() =&gt; { cleanup(); })`
#### Description
Registers a function to be run after each test case. This function calls the `cleanup` method from `@testing-library/react`.

#### Internal Logic
After each test, the `cleanup` function is called, which unmounts React trees that were mounted with `render`, removing them from the DOM and ensuring a clean slate for the next test.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @testing-library/jest-dom/matchers | Provides custom DOM-related matchers for enhanced assertions |
| @testing-library/react | Provides the `cleanup` function for unmounting React components after tests |
| vitest | Test runner, provides `afterEach` and `expect` functions |

## Error Handling
This setup file does not implement explicit error handling. Any errors during the setup process or test execution will be handled by the Vitest test runner.

## Side Effects
1. Extends the global `expect` function with additional matchers.
2. Registers a cleanup function to run after each test, which affects the DOM by unmounting React components.

These side effects are intentional and crucial for setting up a proper testing environment for React applications.
