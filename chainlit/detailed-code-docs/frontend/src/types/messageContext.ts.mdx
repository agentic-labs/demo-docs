## High-level description
This TypeScript file defines the `IMessageContext` interface, which represents the context for handling messages in a frontend application. It includes various properties and functions for file uploading, user interactions, UI state management, and error handling.

### `IMessageContext`
#### Description
An interface that defines the structure of the message context used in the application. It includes various optional and required properties that control the behavior and appearance of messages.

#### Properties
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| uploadFile | Function (optional) | Handles file uploads with progress tracking |
| askUser | IAsk (optional) | Represents a user prompt or question |
| defaultCollapseContent | boolean | Determines if content should be collapsed by default |
| highlightedMessage | string \| null | Identifies a highlighted message, if any |
| loading | boolean | Indicates if a loading state is active |
| showFeedbackButtons | boolean | Controls the visibility of feedback buttons |
| uiName | string | Specifies the name of the UI component |
| allowHtml | boolean (optional) | Determines if HTML content is allowed |
| latex | boolean (optional) | Indicates if LaTeX rendering is enabled |
| onElementRefClick | Function (optional) | Handles clicks on element references |
| onFeedbackUpdated | Function (optional) | Handles feedback updates for messages |
| onFeedbackDeleted | Function (optional) | Handles feedback deletion for messages |
| onError | Function | Handles error reporting |

#### Internal Logic
The interface combines various aspects of message handling, including:
1. File upload functionality with progress tracking
2. User interaction through prompts or questions
3. UI state management (collapse state, highlighting, loading)
4. Feedback system for messages
5. Error handling

## Dependencies
The file imports several types from 'client-types/', which are likely defined in a separate package or module:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| IAsk | Defines the structure for user prompts or questions |
| IFeedback | Represents feedback data for messages |
| IFileRef | Describes a reference to an uploaded file |
| IMessageElement | Defines the structure of a message element |
| IStep | Represents a step or message in the conversation |

## References
This interface is used in other parts of the application, as seen in the related code snippets:
1. In `MessageContainer.tsx`, it's used as a prop type and passed to the `MessageContext.Provider`.
2. In `MessageContext.tsx`, it's used to type the context created with `createContext`.

## Notes
1. The `uploadFile` function returns an object with an `XMLHttpRequest` and a `Promise`, suggesting it's designed for both synchronous and asynchronous operations.
2. The interface includes optional properties (marked with `?`), allowing for flexible usage in different scenarios.
3. The `onFeedbackUpdated` and `onFeedbackDeleted` functions include an `onSuccess` callback, indicating they might be asynchronous operations.
4. The `onError` function is the only required function in the interface, emphasizing the importance of error handling in the application.

This interface plays a crucial role in managing the state and behavior of messages throughout the application, providing a comprehensive set of properties and functions for handling various aspects of message display and interaction.
