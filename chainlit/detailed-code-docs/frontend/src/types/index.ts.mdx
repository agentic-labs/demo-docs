## High-level description
This file, `frontend/src/types/index.ts`, serves as a central export point for various TypeScript types used in the frontend of the application. It re-exports all the types defined in three separate files: `Input.ts`, `messageContext.ts`, and `NotificationCount.tsx`.

## Code Structure
The file uses ES6 export syntax to re-export all named exports from three separate files. This pattern is commonly used to create a single entry point for importing types across the application.

### Export statements
#### Description
The file contains three export statements, each using the `export *` syntax to re-export all named exports from the specified files.

#### Internal Logic
1. `export * from './Input';`: This statement re-exports all named exports from the `Input.ts` file.
2. `export * from './messageContext';`: This statement re-exports all named exports from the `messageContext.ts` file.
3. `export * from './NotificationCount';`: This statement re-exports all named exports from the `NotificationCount.tsx` file.

## Dependencies
The file depends on three local modules:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| './Input' | Provides types related to input components |
| './messageContext' | Provides types related to message context |
| './NotificationCount' | Provides types related to notification counts |

## References
Based on the related code snippets provided, we can infer that the following types are being exported:

1. From `Input.ts`:
   - `IInput` interface

2. From `messageContext.ts`:
   - `IMessageContext` interface

3. From `NotificationCount.tsx`:
   - `NotificationCountProps` type

These types are now available for import from this central `index.ts` file, allowing other parts of the application to import them like this:

```typescript
import { IInput, IMessageContext, NotificationCountProps } from 'path/to/types';
```

This structure simplifies imports and provides a clean, centralized way to manage and access types across the frontend application.
