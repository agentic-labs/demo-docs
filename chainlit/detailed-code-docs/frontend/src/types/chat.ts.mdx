## High-level description
This TypeScript file defines two interfaces, `IToken` and `ISession`, which are likely used for managing chat-related data structures in a frontend application. The file imports a `Socket` type from the `@chainlit/react-client` library, suggesting it's part of a real-time communication system.

## Symbols

### `IToken`
#### Description
The `IToken` interface defines the structure for a token object, which is likely used to represent individual units of text or data in a chat or messaging context.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | number \| string | A unique identifier for the token |
| token | string | The actual content or value of the token |
| isSequence | boolean | A flag indicating whether the token is part of a sequence |

### `ISession`
#### Description
The `ISession` interface defines the structure for a session object, which appears to represent a connection session in the chat application.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| socket | Socket | A Socket object, likely used for real-time communication |
| error? | boolean | An optional boolean flag indicating whether an error has occurred in the session |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @chainlit/react-client | Provides the `Socket` type used in the `ISession` interface |

This file serves as a type definition module, providing structured interfaces for tokens and sessions in a chat application. These interfaces can be used throughout the frontend codebase to ensure type safety and consistency when working with chat-related data structures.
