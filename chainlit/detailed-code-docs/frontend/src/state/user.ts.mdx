## High-level description
This code defines a Recoil atom for managing user environment variables in a React application. It retrieves the user environment from local storage, if available, and initializes the atom with either the parsed data or an empty object.

## Symbols

### `userEnvState`
#### Description
`userEnvState` is a Recoil atom that stores user environment variables as a record of string key-value pairs. It is initialized with data from local storage if available, otherwise with an empty object.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| key | string | The unique identifier for this Recoil atom |
| default | Record&lt;string, string&gt; | The default value for the atom |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| userEnvState | RecoilState&lt;Record&lt;string, string&gt;&gt; | A Recoil atom containing user environment variables |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the 'userEnv' item from local storage.
2. If the item exists, it parses the JSON string into an object.
3. If the item doesn't exist, it uses an empty object as the default value.
4. Creates a Recoil atom with the key 'UserEnv' and the determined default value.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| recoil | Used for state management in React applications |

## Side Effects
- Reads from local storage to initialize the atom's default value.

## References
The `userEnvState` atom is used in several other parts of the application:

1. In `frontend/src/pages/Page.tsx`, it's used to check if required environment variables are set.
2. In `frontend/src/App.tsx`, it's used as part of the chat session connection process.
3. In `frontend/src/pages/Env.tsx`, it's used to manage and update user environment variables.

These references indicate that the `userEnvState` plays a crucial role in managing user-specific environment variables across the application, particularly for authentication and configuration purposes.
