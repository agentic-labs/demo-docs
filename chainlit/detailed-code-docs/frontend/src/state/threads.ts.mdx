## High-level description
This code defines a Recoil atom named `threadsFiltersState` that manages the state of thread filters in a React application. It provides a centralized way to store and update filter criteria for threads, which can be used across different components.

## Symbols

### `threadsFiltersState`
#### Description
`threadsFiltersState` is a Recoil atom that holds the state of thread filters. It is initialized with an empty object as its default value.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| key | string | A unique identifier for the Recoil atom |
| default | IThreadFilters | The default value for the atom |

#### Outputs
The atom returns and stores a value of type `IThreadFilters`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| recoil | State management library used to create the atom |
| @chainlit/react-client | Provides the `IThreadFilters` interface |

## References
This code is referenced and used in several other parts of the application:

1. In `frontend/src/components/organisms/sidebar/threadHistory/index.tsx`, the `threadsFiltersState` is used to manage and apply filters to the thread history.

2. In `frontend/src/components/organisms/sidebar/threadHistory/filters/FeedbackSelect.tsx`, the atom is used to update and read the feedback filter state.

3. In `frontend/src/components/organisms/sidebar/threadHistory/filters/SearchBar.tsx`, the atom is used to update and read the search filter state.

## Notes
1. The `IThreadFilters` interface is imported from `@chainlit/react-client`, which suggests that this code is part of a larger application or framework.

2. The use of Recoil for state management indicates that this is likely part of a React application with complex state requirements.

3. The empty default value for the atom suggests that no filters are applied by default, and they are added as needed by the user interactions in the application.

4. This atom serves as a single source of truth for thread filters across the application, allowing for consistent filtering behavior in different components.
