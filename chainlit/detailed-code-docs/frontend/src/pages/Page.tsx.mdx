## High-level description
This code defines a `Page` component in React that serves as a layout wrapper for other pages in the application. It handles authentication, user environment checks, and renders the main structure of the page including a sidebar, header, and content area.

## Code Structure
The `Page` component is the main export. It uses several hooks and components to manage the application state and render the page layout. The component checks for authentication and user environment variables before rendering the main content.

## References
- `Navigate` from 'react-router-dom'
- Various components from '@mui/material'
- Custom hooks and components from '@chainlit/react-client'
- Custom components from the project's component library

### Page
#### Description
A functional component that serves as a layout wrapper for other pages in the application.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| children | JSX.Element | The content to be rendered within the page layout |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the user is authenticated
2. Verifies required user environment variables
3. Renders the page layout with sidebar, header, and content area
4. Conditionally renders a task list and side view element

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react-router-dom | For navigation components |
| recoil | For state management |
| @mui/material | For UI components |
| @chainlit/react-client | For custom hooks and components |

## Error Handling
The component displays an error alert if the user is not authenticated but somehow reaches this component.

## Side Effects
- Redirects to the login page if the user is not authenticated
- Redirects to the environment setup page if required user environment variables are not set

## Performance Considerations
The component uses `useRecoilValue` for efficient state management, which helps in optimizing re-renders.
