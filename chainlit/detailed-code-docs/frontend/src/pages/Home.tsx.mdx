## High-level description
The `Home` component is a simple React functional component that serves as the main page of the application. It renders a `Chat` component wrapped inside a `Page` component, providing a structured layout for the chat interface.

## Code Structure
The `Home` component is a straightforward composition of two main components: `Page` and `Chat`. The `Page` component likely provides a common layout or structure, while the `Chat` component contains the main functionality for the chat interface.

## References
- `Page` from 'pages/Page'
- `Chat` from 'components/organisms/chat/index'

## Symbols

### Home
#### Description
The `Home` function is the default export of this module. It renders the main structure of the home page by combining the `Page` and `Chat` components.

#### Inputs
This function doesn't take any inputs.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSX.Element | React component | Returns a JSX element representing the structure of the home page |

#### Internal Logic
1. The function returns a JSX structure.
2. It uses the `Page` component as a wrapper.
3. Inside the `Page` component, it renders the `Chat` component.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| React | Implied for JSX syntax and component structure |
| pages/Page | Provides the `Page` component for layout structure |
| components/organisms/chat/index | Provides the `Chat` component for the main chat functionality |

## Additional Context
Based on the related files provided:

1. The `Page` component (from `frontend/src/pages/Page.tsx`) seems to handle authentication, user environment checks, and provides a common layout structure including a sidebar, header, and task list.

2. The `Chat` component (from `frontend/src/components/organisms/chat/index.tsx`) is a complex component that manages the chat interface, including file uploads, message display, and input functionality.

3. The `router.tsx` file shows that the `Home` component is rendered at the root path ('/') of the application.

This structure suggests that the `Home` component serves as the entry point for the main chat functionality of the application, utilizing the `Page` component for consistent layout and authentication checks, and the `Chat` component for the core chat features.
