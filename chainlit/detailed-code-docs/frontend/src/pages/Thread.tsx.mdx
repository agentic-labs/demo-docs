title: "Thread.tsx"
---

## High-level description
This code defines a React component for a Thread page in a chat application. It displays either the current chat or a historical thread, depending on whether the thread is active or not. The component uses various hooks and states to manage the thread data and user interface.

## Code Structure
The main component `ThreadPage` uses several hooks and components to render the appropriate content. It relies on the `useApi` hook to fetch thread data, and uses Recoil for state management. The component conditionally renders either the current chat or a historical thread view based on the `isCurrentThread` flag.

## Symbols

### ThreadPage
#### Description
The main functional component that renders the Thread page. It fetches thread data, manages the thread history state, and renders either the current chat or a historical thread view.

#### Internal Logic
1. Fetches thread data using the `useApi` hook.
2. Updates the thread history state when the thread ID changes.
3. Renders the appropriate content based on whether the thread is current or historical.

### useParams
#### Description
A hook from `react-router-dom` used to access URL parameters.

### useRecoilState
#### Description
A hook from Recoil used for accessing and updating state.

### useApi
#### Description
A custom hook (likely from `@chainlit/react-client`) used to fetch data from an API endpoint.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| url | string \| null | The API endpoint URL |
| options | object | API request options |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| data | IThread \| undefined | The fetched thread data |
| error | Error \| undefined | Any error that occurred during the fetch |
| isLoading | boolean | Indicates if the data is still being fetched |

### useChatMessages
#### Description
A custom hook (likely from `@chainlit/react-client`) used to access chat message data.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| threadId | string \| undefined | The ID of the current thread |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react | Core React library |
| react-router-dom | Routing library for React |
| recoil | State management library |
| @mui/material | Material-UI components |
| @chainlit/react-client | Custom hooks and components for the chat application |

## Side Effects
The component updates the `threadHistoryState` when the thread ID changes, which may affect other parts of the application that rely on this state.

## Performance Considerations
The `useApi` hook is configured with `revalidateOnFocus: false` to prevent unnecessary refetching of thread data when the window regains focus.
