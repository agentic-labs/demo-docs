## High-level description
This directory contains the theme configuration for a React application using Material-UI (MUI). It defines color palettes, typography, component styles, and creates both dark and light themes. The code is organized to provide a centralized and consistent approach to theming across the entire frontend application.

## What does it do?
The theme directory serves several key purposes:

1. Color Management: It defines a comprehensive set of color palettes, including shades of white, grey, primary colors, green, and yellow. These colors are used consistently throughout the application to maintain a cohesive visual design.

2. Theme Creation: It provides functions to create both dark and light themes. These themes include customizations for typography, component styles, shapes, and color schemes.

3. Specialized Themes: It offers specialized themes for grey buttons in both dark and light modes, allowing for more granular control over specific UI elements.

4. Centralized Exports: The directory acts as a central point for exporting all theme-related functionality, making it easy for other parts of the application to import and use theme elements.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this directory is the `index.ts` file. This file re-exports all the symbols from the `palette.ts` and `theme.tsx` files, providing a single import location for all theme-related functionality.

The data flow in this directory is as follows:
1. `palette.ts` defines the color schemes.
2. `theme.tsx` uses these color schemes to create theme objects and functions.
3. `index.ts` re-exports everything, making it accessible to the rest of the application.

## Key Files

### palette.ts
This file defines the color palettes used throughout the application. It exports:
- Constants for white, grey, primary, green, and yellow colors, each with various shades.
- A default export combining all color palettes.

Example usage:
```typescript
import { grey, primary } from 'src/theme';

const backgroundColor = grey[100];
const textColor = primary[900];
```

### theme.tsx
This file creates the theme configurations using MUI's `createTheme` function. It exports:
- `makeTheme`: A function to create either a dark or light theme.
- `darkGreyButtonTheme` and `lightGreyButtonTheme`: Specialized themes for grey buttons.

Example usage:
```typescript
import { makeTheme } from 'src/theme';

const darkTheme = makeTheme('dark');
const lightTheme = makeTheme('light', 'Roboto');
```

## Dependencies
The main external dependency for this directory is Material-UI (MUI). Specifically, it uses:
- `@mui/material`: For theming and component utilities.

The choice of MUI as a dependency provides a robust and widely-used theming system, allowing for consistent and customizable UI components across the application.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files, the themes themselves act as configuration for the application's appearance. Key configurable aspects include:

1. Color Palettes: Defined in `palette.ts`, these can be adjusted to change the overall color scheme of the application.

2. Typography: The default font family is set to 'Inter' with a fallback to 'sans-serif'. This can be customized when calling the theme creation functions.

3. Component Styles: Default props and styles for various MUI components are defined in the `components` object within `theme.tsx`. These can be modified to change the default appearance of components throughout the application.

4. Breakpoints: The theme creation functions accept optional custom breakpoints, allowing for responsive design customization.

Example of customizing the theme:
```typescript
import { makeTheme } from 'src/theme';

const customTheme = makeTheme('light', 'Roboto', {
  values: {
    xs: 0,
    sm: 600,
    md: 960,
    lg: 1280,
    xl: 1920,
  }
});
```

This theme directory provides a flexible and maintainable way to manage the visual design of the application, ensuring consistency across components and allowing for easy customization when needed.
