## High-level description
This file serves as an entry point for the theme-related exports in the application. It re-exports all the symbols from the 'palette' and 'theme' modules, making them easily accessible to other parts of the application that need to use theme-related functionality.

## Code Structure
The code consists of two export statements that use the wildcard (*) syntax to re-export all named exports from the 'palette' and 'theme' modules.

## References
This file references two other modules:
1. './palette'
2. './theme'

## Symbols
There are no explicit symbols defined in this file. It acts as a re-export module.

## Dependencies
This file doesn't directly depend on any external libraries. However, it indirectly depends on the contents of the 'palette' and 'theme' modules.

## API/Interface Reference
While this file doesn't define an API itself, it exposes the following interfaces through its re-exports:

### From './palette':
- Color constants: `white`, `grey`, `primary`, `green`, `yellow`
- Default export: An object containing all color palettes

### From './theme':
- `makeTheme`: A function to create either a dark or light theme
- `darkGreyButtonTheme`: A predefined dark grey button theme
- `lightGreyButtonTheme`: A predefined light grey button theme

These exports provide a centralized access point for theme-related functionality in the application, allowing other parts of the codebase to import theme elements from a single location.
