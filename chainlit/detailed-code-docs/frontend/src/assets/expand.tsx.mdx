## High-level description
This code defines a custom React component called `ExpandIcon`, which renders an SVG icon using Material-UI's `SvgIcon` component. The icon represents an expand or fullscreen action, typically used in user interfaces to indicate that something can be enlarged or expanded to full view.

## Symbols

### ExpandIcon
#### Description
`ExpandIcon` is a functional React component that creates a custom SVG icon using Material-UI's `SvgIcon` component. It renders an expand icon consisting of two polylines and two lines, forming arrows pointing outwards from the top-right and bottom-left corners.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| props | SvgIconProps | Props to be passed to the underlying SvgIcon component |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| - | React.ReactElement | A rendered SVG icon component |

#### Internal Logic
1. The component spreads the received `props` onto the `SvgIcon` component, allowing for customization.
2. It sets specific style properties for the icon:
   - `strokeLinecap` and `strokeLinejoin` are set to 'round' for smooth corners.
   - `strokeWidth` is set to 2 for a medium thickness.
   - `fill` is set to 'none' to create an outline icon.
   - `stroke` is set to 'currentColor' to inherit the color from the parent element.
3. The `viewBox` is set to "0 0 24 24", defining a 24x24 coordinate system for the SVG.
4. The icon is composed of four SVG elements:
   - Two `&lt;polyline&gt;` elements creating arrows in the top-right and bottom-left corners.
   - Two `&lt;line&gt;` elements connecting the arrows to create an expand icon effect.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @mui/material/SvgIcon | Provides the SvgIcon component and SvgIconProps type |

## References
The `ExpandIcon` component is used in the `Header` component from the file `libs/copilot/src/components/Header.tsx`. It's rendered as part of an `IconButton` to toggle between expanded and minimized states.

```typescript
&lt;IconButton onClick={() =&gt; setExpanded(!expanded)}&gt;
  {expanded ? (
    &lt;MinimizeIcon sx={{ width: 16, height: 16 }} /&gt;
  ) : (
    &lt;ExpandIcon sx={{ width: 16, height: 16 }} /&gt;
  )}
&lt;/IconButton&gt;
```

This usage suggests that the `ExpandIcon` is part of a UI element that allows users to expand or minimize a certain view or component in the application.
