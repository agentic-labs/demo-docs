### MicrophoneIcon
#### Description
`MicrophoneIcon` is a functional React component that creates a customized SVG icon representing a microphone. It utilizes the `SvgIcon` component from Material-UI and applies specific styling and path definitions to create the microphone shape.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| props | SvgIconProps | Props inherited from Material-UI's SvgIcon component |

#### Outputs
The component returns a rendered `SvgIcon` element with the microphone shape.

#### Internal Logic
1. The component spreads the received props onto the `SvgIcon` component.
2. It applies custom styling to the icon:
   - Sets `strokeLinecap` and `strokeLinejoin` to 'round'
   - Sets `strokeWidth` to 2
   - Sets `fill` to 'none'
   - Sets `stroke` to 'currentColor' (inherits color from parent)
3. Defines a custom `viewBox` of "0 0 24 24"
4. Renders two `path` elements and one `line` element to create the microphone shape:
   - The first `path` creates the main body of the microphone
   - The second `path` creates the base of the microphone
   - The `line` element creates the stem of the microphone

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @mui/material/SvgIcon | Provides the base SvgIcon component and its props type |

## Usage
The `MicrophoneIcon` component is used in other parts of the application, specifically in the `RecordScreen` component (as seen in the related code snippets). It's utilized to display a microphone icon in the user interface, likely for audio recording or voice input features.

In the `RecordScreen` component, the `MicrophoneIcon` is rendered with additional styling:
```tsx
&lt;MicrophoneIcon
  sx={{
    height: 87,
    width: 87,
    color: 'primary.main',
    position: 'absolute',
    top: '50%',
    left: '50%',
    transform: 'translate(-50%, -50%)'
  }}
/&gt;
```

This usage suggests that the `MicrophoneIcon` is a key visual element in the audio recording interface of the application.
