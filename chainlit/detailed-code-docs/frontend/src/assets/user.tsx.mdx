## High-level description
This code defines a custom React component called `UserIcon` that renders a user icon using SVG. It utilizes Material-UI's `SvgIcon` component to create a reusable and customizable icon for representing users in a user interface.

## Symbols

### UserIcon
#### Description
`UserIcon` is a functional React component that creates an SVG icon representing a user. It uses Material-UI's `SvgIcon` component as a wrapper and defines the SVG path for the user icon.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| props | SvgIconProps | Props passed to the SvgIcon component |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| - | React.ReactElement | A rendered SVG icon representing a user |

#### Internal Logic
1. The component returns an `SvgIcon` component from Material-UI.
2. Inside the `SvgIcon`, it renders an SVG element with specific attributes:
   - `viewBox`: Sets the coordinate system for the SVG.
   - `fill`: Set to "none" for a transparent fill.
   - `stroke`: Uses "currentColor" to inherit the color from the parent element.
   - `strokeWidth`: Sets the thickness of the stroke.
   - `strokeLinecap` and `strokeLinejoin`: Define the style of line endings and joins.
3. The SVG path consists of two parts:
   - A path representing the body of the user icon.
   - A circle representing the head of the user icon.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @mui/material/SvgIcon | Provides the SvgIcon component for creating custom icons |

## References
The `UserIcon` component is used in other parts of the application, specifically in the `UserAvatar` component (frontend/src/components/atoms/buttons/userButton/avatar.tsx). It's used as a fallback icon when no user image is available.

## Performance Considerations
The `UserIcon` component is lightweight and should have minimal performance impact. It's a stateless functional component that renders a simple SVG, making it efficient for frequent re-renders.
