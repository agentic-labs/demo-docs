### SquarePenIcon
#### Description
`SquarePenIcon` is a functional React component that creates an SVG icon representing a square with a pen. It utilizes Material-UI's `SvgIcon` component to wrap the SVG content, allowing for easy styling and integration with other Material-UI components.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| props | SvgIconProps | Props to be passed to the SvgIcon component |

#### Outputs
Returns a React element representing the SquarePenIcon.

#### Internal Logic
1. The component returns an `SvgIcon` component from Material-UI.
2. Inside the `SvgIcon`, an SVG element is defined with specific attributes:
   - `viewBox` is set to "0 0 24 24" for a standard icon size.
   - `fill` is set to "none" to allow for stroke-based rendering.
   - `stroke` is set to "currentColor" to inherit the color from the parent element.
   - `strokeWidth`, `strokeLinecap`, and `strokeLinejoin` are set for consistent stroke styling.
3. Two `path` elements are defined within the SVG:
   - The first path creates the square shape with rounded corners.
   - The second path creates the pen shape overlapping the square.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @mui/material/SvgIcon | Provides the SvgIcon component for wrapping the SVG content |

## References
The `SquarePenIcon` component is used in other parts of the application, specifically:
1. In `NewChatButton` components (both in the copilot library and the frontend) as an icon for initiating a new chat.

These references demonstrate that the `SquarePenIcon` is an important visual element in the user interface, particularly for actions related to creating or starting new chats.
