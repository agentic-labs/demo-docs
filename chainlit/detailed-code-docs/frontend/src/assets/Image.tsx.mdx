## High-level description

### ImageIcon
#### Description
`ImageIcon` is a functional React component that creates a customized SVG icon using Material-UI's `SvgIcon` component. It renders a complex image-related icon with specific styling and viewBox properties.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| props | SvgIconProps | Props passed to the SvgIcon component |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| React.Element | JSX.Element | A rendered SVG icon |

#### Internal Logic
1. The component spreads the received props to the `SvgIcon` component.
2. It sets a custom style to use the current color for filling the icon.
3. It defines a custom viewBox of "0 0 24 24" for the icon.
4. Two SVG paths are defined within the icon:
   - A simple path for a circular element (possibly representing a lens or button).
   - A complex path using the `fillRule="evenodd"` and `clipRule="evenodd"` to create the main body of the icon, resembling a tilted camera or image frame.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @mui/material/SvgIcon | Provides the base SvgIcon component and SvgIconProps type |

## References
The `ImageIcon` component is used in other parts of the application, as seen in the related code snippet:

- In `frontend/src/components/organisms/chat/dropScreen.tsx`, the `ImageIcon` is used within a `DropScreen` component, likely representing a file drop area for image uploads.

## Usage Example
Based on the related code snippet, here's how the `ImageIcon` is typically used:

```jsx
&lt;ImageIcon
  sx={{ width: '100px', height: '100px', color: 'grey.400' }}
/&gt;
```

This usage demonstrates that the icon can be easily resized and recolored using Material-UI's `sx` prop, making it highly customizable for different contexts within the application.
