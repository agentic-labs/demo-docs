## High-level description
This code defines a custom React component called `CopyIcon`, which renders an SVG icon for a "copy" action. The icon is created using Material-UI's `SvgIcon` component and is designed to be easily integrated into Material-UI based applications.

### CopyIcon
#### Description
`CopyIcon` is a functional React component that creates an SVG icon representing a "copy" action. It utilizes Material-UI's `SvgIcon` component to render the icon with specific styling and viewBox properties.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| props | SvgIconProps | Props inherited from Material-UI's SvgIcon component |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| - | JSX.Element | A rendered SVG icon component |

#### Internal Logic
1. The component spreads the received `props` into the `SvgIcon` component, allowing for customization.
2. It sets specific style properties for the SVG, including stroke characteristics and fill.
3. The icon's viewBox is set to "0 0 24 24", defining a 24x24 coordinate system.
4. The icon's shape is defined using SVG elements:
   - A rectangle (`rect`) representing a document or clipboard.
   - A path element drawing lines to create a "stacked papers" effect.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @mui/material/SvgIcon | Provides the base SvgIcon component and SvgIconProps type |

## References
This component is used in other parts of the application, specifically:
- In the `ClipboardCopy` component (frontend/src/components/atoms/ClipboardCopy.tsx), where it's used as the icon for a copy-to-clipboard functionality.

## Performance Considerations
The `CopyIcon` component is a lightweight, stateless functional component that should have minimal performance impact. It's designed to be easily reusable across the application wherever a copy icon is needed.
