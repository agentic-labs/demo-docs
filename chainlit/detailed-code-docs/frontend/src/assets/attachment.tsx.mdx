## High-level description
This code defines a custom React component called `AttachmentIcon`, which renders an SVG icon representing an attachment. The icon is created using Material-UI's `SvgIcon` component and is designed to be used within a React application, likely as part of a user interface for file attachment functionality.

### AttachmentIcon
#### Description
`AttachmentIcon` is a functional React component that creates a custom SVG icon using Material-UI's `SvgIcon` component. It represents an attachment icon with a specific path design.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| props | SvgIconProps | Props inherited from Material-UI's SvgIcon component |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| - | React.ReactElement | Returns a rendered SvgIcon component |

#### Internal Logic
1. The component spreads the received props onto the `SvgIcon` component.
2. It sets custom style properties for the icon, including stroke characteristics and fill.
3. It defines a custom viewBox for the SVG.
4. The icon's shape is defined using a `path` element with a specific `d` attribute that draws the attachment icon.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @mui/material/SvgIcon | Provides the base SvgIcon component and its prop types |

## References
This component is used in the `UploadButton` component found in `frontend/src/components/organisms/chat/inputBox/UploadButton.tsx`, where it's imported as:

```typescript
import AttachmentIcon from 'assets/attachment';
```

This suggests that the `AttachmentIcon` is used as part of a file upload functionality in the application's chat input box.

## Performance Considerations
The `AttachmentIcon` component is a lightweight, stateless functional component that should have minimal performance impact. It's designed to be reusable and can be easily integrated into various parts of the application where an attachment icon is needed.
