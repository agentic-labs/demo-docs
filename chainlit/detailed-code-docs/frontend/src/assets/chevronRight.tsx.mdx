### ChevronRightIcon
#### Description
`ChevronRightIcon` is a functional React component that creates a custom SVG icon using Material-UI's `SvgIcon` component. It renders two chevron shapes pointing to the right.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| props | SvgIconProps | Props inherited from Material-UI's SvgIcon component |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| - | React.ReactElement | A rendered SVG icon wrapped in an SvgIcon component |

#### Internal Logic
1. The component returns an `SvgIcon` component from Material-UI.
2. Inside the `SvgIcon`, it renders an SVG element with specific attributes:
   - `viewBox` is set to "0 0 24 24" to define the coordinate system.
   - `fill` is set to "none" to ensure the icon is not filled.
   - `stroke` is set to "currentColor" to use the current text color.
   - `strokeWidth`, `strokeLinecap`, and `strokeLinejoin` are set for styling.
3. Two `path` elements are defined to create the double chevron shape:
   - The first path draws the left chevron.
   - The second path draws the right chevron.
4. The `{...props}` spread operator is used to pass any additional props to the SVG element.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @mui/material/SvgIcon | Provides the SvgIcon component and SvgIconProps type |

## Notes
- This component is likely part of a larger icon library used in the frontend of the application.
- The use of Material-UI's `SvgIcon` component ensures that the custom icon will be consistent with other Material-UI icons in terms of sizing and color inheritance.
- The icon is designed to be flexible in color, as it uses `currentColor` for the stroke, allowing it to adapt to the color of its parent element.
- The component is exported as the default export, making it easy to import and use in other parts of the application.
