### PencilIcon
#### Description
`PencilIcon` is a functional React component that creates an SVG icon of a pencil. It utilizes Material-UI's `SvgIcon` component to wrap the SVG content, allowing for easy integration with other Material-UI components and styling systems.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| props | SvgIconProps | Props passed to the SvgIcon component |

#### Outputs
The component returns a JSX element representing the pencil icon.

#### Internal Logic
1. The component renders an `SvgIcon` from Material-UI.
2. Inside the `SvgIcon`, it defines an SVG with specific attributes:
   - `viewBox` is set to "0 0 24 24" for a standard icon size.
   - `fill` is set to "none" to allow for stroke-based rendering.
   - `stroke` is set to "currentColor" to inherit the color from the parent element.
   - `strokeWidth`, `strokeLinecap`, and `strokeLinejoin` are set for consistent stroke styling.
3. The SVG contains two `path` elements:
   - The first path draws the main body of the pencil and its tip.
   - The second path adds a small line near the eraser end of the pencil.
4. The `{...props}` spread operator is used to pass any additional props to the SVG element, allowing for further customization.

## Dependencies

| @mui/material/SvgIcon | Provides the SvgIcon component for creating customizable icons |

## References
This component is referenced in the `UserMessage` component (`frontend/src/components/molecules/messages/UserMessage.tsx`) where it's used as an edit icon:

```typescript
import PencilIcon from 'assets/pencil';

// ...

&lt;IconButton
  // ...
  onClick={() =&gt; setIsEditing(true)}
  disabled={disabled}
&gt;
  &lt;PencilIcon sx={{ height: 16, width: 16 }} /&gt;
&lt;/IconButton&gt;
```

This usage suggests that the `PencilIcon` is employed to represent an edit action in the user interface, specifically for editing user messages in a chat-like interface.
