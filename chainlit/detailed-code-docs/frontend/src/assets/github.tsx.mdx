## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `GithubIcon` that renders the GitHub logo as an SVG icon. It utilizes the Material-UI (MUI) `SvgIcon` component to create a reusable and customizable icon component for use in a React application.

### `GithubIcon`
#### Description
`GithubIcon` is a functional React component that creates an SVG icon representing the GitHub logo. It wraps the MUI `SvgIcon` component and provides a custom viewBox and path for the GitHub logo.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| props | SvgIconProps | Props to be passed to the underlying SvgIcon component |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| - | React.ReactElement | A rendered SVG icon component |

#### Internal Logic
1. The component spreads the received props onto the `SvgIcon` component.
2. It sets a custom `viewBox` of "0 0 98 96" to properly scale the GitHub logo.
3. The SVG path data for the GitHub logo is provided as a child of the `SvgIcon`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @mui/material/SvgIcon | Provides the base SvgIcon component and its prop types |

## References
This `GithubIcon` component is used in the `GithubButton` component (frontend/src/components/atoms/buttons/githubButton.tsx), which creates a button with the GitHub logo to link to a repository.

## Performance Considerations
The `GithubIcon` component is a lightweight, stateless functional component that should have minimal performance impact. It leverages the optimizations provided by the Material-UI `SvgIcon` component.
