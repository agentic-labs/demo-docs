## High-level description
This directory contains a collection of custom SVG icons implemented as React components using Material-UI's SvgIcon. These icons are designed to be used throughout the frontend of the application, providing a consistent and customizable set of visual elements for various user interface components.

## What does it do?
The assets in this directory serve as a custom icon library for the application. Each file defines one or more icon components that can be imported and used in other parts of the application. These icons represent various concepts and actions such as messaging, user profiles, debugging, file attachments, and UI controls like expand/minimize buttons.

The icons are designed to be easily customizable, allowing for changes in color, size, and other properties through the use of Material-UI's styling system. They provide a cohesive visual language for the application, enhancing user experience and maintaining design consistency.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @mui/material/SvgIcon | Provides the base SvgIcon component used in all icon implementations |
| React | The core library for building the components |

## Configuration
These icon components do not require specific configuration. They are designed to be used with Material-UI's theming and styling system, allowing for easy customization through props and sx prop when used in other components.

The icons generally follow a consistent pattern:
- They use a viewBox of "0 0 24 24" for standard sizing.
- Most use stroke-based rendering with `fill="none"` and `stroke="currentColor"` for easy color inheritance.
- They often include props like `strokeWidth`, `strokeLinecap`, and `strokeLinejoin` for consistent styling.

These assets form an essential part of the application's visual language, providing a unified set of icons that can be easily integrated and customized throughout the frontend. They contribute to a cohesive user interface and enhance the overall user experience by providing clear, recognizable visual cues for various actions and concepts within the application.
