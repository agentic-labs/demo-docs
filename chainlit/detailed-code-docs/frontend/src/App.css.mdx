## High-level description
This CSS file defines styles for elements within the "markdown-body" class, which is likely used for rendering markdown content in the application. It focuses on handling overflow, image sizing, text wrapping, and margin adjustments for better presentation of markdown-rendered content.

## Symbols

### `.markdown-body`
#### Description
This class is applied to the container of markdown-rendered content. It sets overflow properties to ensure proper content display.

#### Internal Logic
- `overflow-x: auto;`: Allows horizontal scrolling if content exceeds the container width.
- `overflow-y: hidden;`: Hides vertical overflow, preventing vertical scrolling within this element.

### `.markdown-body img`
#### Description
This selector targets all image elements within the markdown content.

#### Internal Logic
- `max-width: 100%;`: Ensures that images do not exceed the width of their container, maintaining responsive design.

### `.markdown-body p`
#### Description
This selector applies to all paragraph elements within the markdown content.

#### Internal Logic
- `white-space: break-spaces;`: Allows long words to break and wrap onto the next line, improving readability for long content.

### `.ai-message .markdown-body &gt; :first-child`
#### Description
This selector targets the first direct child element of the markdown-body class when it's inside an element with the "ai-message" class.

#### Internal Logic
- `margin-top: 0;`: Removes the top margin of the first element, likely to reduce unnecessary spacing in AI-generated messages.

## Dependencies
This CSS file doesn't explicitly depend on external libraries or modules. However, it assumes the existence of certain HTML structures, particularly elements with the classes "markdown-body" and "ai-message".

## Performance Considerations
The CSS rules are relatively simple and shouldn't have significant performance implications. The use of `max-width` for images helps in maintaining responsiveness without the need for more complex calculations.
