title: "useFetch.tsx"
---

## High-level description
This code defines a custom React hook called `useFetch` that utilizes the SWR (stale-while-revalidate) library for data fetching. It provides a reusable way to fetch data from an API endpoint, handling both JSON and non-JSON responses, and includes basic error handling.

## Code Structure
The code consists of two main parts: a `fetcher` function that handles the actual HTTP request and response processing, and the `useFetch` hook that wraps the SWR hook with this custom fetcher.

## Symbols

### `fetcher`
#### Description
An asynchronous function that performs the HTTP request and processes the response.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| url | string | The URL to fetch data from |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| data | any | The parsed JSON data or raw text response |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sends a fetch request to the provided URL.
2. Checks if the response is ok (status in the range 200-299).
3. Examines the content-type header to determine if the response is JSON.
4. If JSON, parses and returns the JSON data. Otherwise, returns the raw text.

### `useFetch`
#### Description
A custom React hook that wraps the SWR hook with the custom fetcher function.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| endpoint | string \| null | The API endpoint to fetch data from |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| SWRResponse | object | An object containing the fetched data, error state, and loading state |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| useSWR | Provides the core data fetching and caching functionality |
| SWRResponse | Type definition for the response object returned by useSWR |

## Error Handling
The `fetcher` function throws an error if the network response is not ok (status code outside 200-299 range). This error will be caught and handled by the SWR hook, making it available in the returned SWRResponse object.

## References
The `useFetch` hook is used in other components of the application, such as:
1. `TextElement` in `frontend/src/components/atoms/elements/Text.tsx`
2. `PlotlyElement` in `frontend/src/components/atoms/elements/Plotly.tsx`

These components use the `useFetch` hook to retrieve data for rendering text content and Plotly charts, respectively. They handle loading and error states provided by the hook, demonstrating its practical application in the frontend.
