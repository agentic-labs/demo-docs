## High-level description
The `frontend/src/hooks` directory contains a collection of custom React hooks that provide reusable functionality for various aspects of the frontend application. These hooks handle common tasks such as theme management, data fetching, file uploads, and URL query parameter parsing.

## What does it do?
This directory provides a set of utility hooks that can be used across different components in the frontend application:

1. Theme Management: The `useIsDarkMode` hook allows components to easily determine if the current theme is in dark mode, enabling responsive styling based on the theme.

2. Data Fetching: The `useFetch` hook provides a wrapper around the SWR library for efficient data fetching and caching, supporting both JSON and non-JSON responses.

3. File Uploads: The `useUpload` hook offers a comprehensive solution for handling file uploads using react-dropzone, including file type and size validation.

4. URL Query Parsing: The `useQuery` hook simplifies access to URL query parameters, making it easy to extract information from the current URL.

5. Layout Management: The `useLayoutMaxWidth` hook determines the maximum width for the layout based on theme settings, allowing for consistent and responsive layouts across the application.

These hooks encapsulate complex logic and provide simple interfaces for components to use, promoting code reuse and maintainability.

## Key Files

1. `index.ts`: This file exports the `useIsDarkMode` and `useUpload` hooks, making them easily accessible to other parts of the application.

2. `query.ts`: Contains the `useQuery` hook for parsing URL query parameters.

3. `useFetch.tsx`: Implements the `useFetch` hook for data fetching using SWR.

4. `useIsDarkMode.tsx`: Defines the `useIsDarkMode` hook for theme management.

5. `useLayoutMaxWidth.tsx`: Contains the `useLayoutMaxWidth` hook for determining layout widths.

6. `useUpload.tsx`: Implements the `useUpload` hook for file upload functionality.

## Dependencies
The hooks in this directory rely on several external libraries:

1. React: Core library for building user interfaces.
2. react-router-dom: Used for routing and accessing URL information.
3. SWR (stale-while-revalidate): Provides efficient data fetching and caching capabilities.
4. react-dropzone: Offers drag-and-drop file upload functionality.
5. Material-UI (@mui/material): Used for accessing theme information and styles.

These dependencies were chosen to leverage well-established libraries for common frontend tasks, ensuring reliability and maintainability of the codebase.

## Configuration
While the hooks themselves don't require explicit configuration, they do rely on certain application-wide settings:

1. The `useIsDarkMode` hook depends on the Material-UI theme configuration.
2. The `useLayoutMaxWidth` hook relies on a global `window.theme` object with a `layout` property.
3. The `useUpload` hook accepts a `FileSpec` configuration to define file upload constraints.

These configuration dependencies allow the hooks to be flexible and adaptable to different application requirements.

In summary, the `hooks` directory provides a set of powerful and reusable custom hooks that enhance the functionality and maintainability of the frontend application. These hooks abstract common patterns and integrate with popular libraries to offer robust solutions for theme management, data fetching, file uploads, and URL parsing.
