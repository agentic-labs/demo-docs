## High-level description
The `useIsDarkMode` hook is a custom React hook that determines whether the current Material-UI theme is in dark mode. It provides a simple boolean value indicating whether the application is using a dark theme or not.

## Symbols

### `useIsDarkMode`
#### Description
This custom hook utilizes the Material-UI `useTheme` hook to access the current theme and checks if the palette mode is set to 'dark'.

#### Inputs
This hook doesn't take any inputs.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| isDarkMode | boolean | `true` if the current theme is in dark mode, `false` otherwise |

#### Internal Logic
1. The hook uses the `useTheme` hook from Material-UI to access the current theme.
2. It then checks the `theme.palette.mode` property to determine if it's set to 'dark'.
3. The result of this comparison (a boolean value) is returned.

## Dependencies

|:-----------|:--------|
