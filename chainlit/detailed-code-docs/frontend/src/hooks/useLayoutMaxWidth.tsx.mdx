## High-level description
The `useLayoutMaxWidth` hook is a custom React hook that determines the maximum width for the layout based on a theme setting. It returns a string value representing the maximum width, which can be either '60rem' or '48rem' depending on whether the layout is set to 'wide' or not.

## Symbols

### `useLayoutMaxWidth`
#### Description
This hook checks the `window.theme?.layout` property to determine if the layout is set to 'wide'. It then returns a string representing the maximum width for the layout.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| layoutMaxWidth | string | The maximum width for the layout, either 'min(60rem, 100vw)' for wide layout or 'min(48rem, 100vw)' for regular layout |

#### Internal Logic
1. The hook uses a ternary operator to check if `window.theme?.layout` is equal to 'wide'.
2. If true, it returns 'min(60rem, 100vw)'.
3. If false, it returns 'min(48rem, 100vw)'.

## Side Effects
This hook relies on the global `window.theme` object, which is expected to have a `layout` property. If this property is not set or the object doesn't exist, the hook will default to the regular layout width.

## Performance Considerations
The hook doesn't have any significant performance impact as it performs a simple check and returns a string value. However, it's worth noting that it accesses the global `window` object, which might have a minor performance cost in some scenarios.

## Dependencies
This hook doesn't have any external dependencies. It relies on the presence of a global `window.theme` object with a `layout` property.

## Usage
This hook is used in various components throughout the application to ensure consistent maximum widths for layout elements. It's particularly useful for responsive design, allowing the application to adjust its layout based on a theme setting.

The hook is used in components such as `MessageLoader`, `Chat`, `Readme`, `Thread`, `ResumeButton`, `Message`, `Env`, `InputBox`, and `ElementView`. In these components, it's typically used to set the `maxWidth` property of container elements, ensuring that the content doesn't exceed a certain width on larger screens while still being responsive on smaller screens.

## Error Handling
The hook uses the optional chaining operator (`?.`) when accessing `window.theme?.layout`, which prevents errors if `window.theme` is undefined. No explicit error handling is implemented within the hook itself.

## Notes
- The use of `@ts-expect-error` suggests that there might be a type mismatch or missing type definition for the `window.theme` object. This should be addressed in the future to improve type safety.
- The hook assumes that the `layout` property, if set, will have a value of 'wide'. Any other value will result in the regular layout width being used.
