## High-level description
This code sets up internationalization (i18n) for a React application using the i18next library. It exports a function to initialize the i18n configuration with English (US) as the fallback language and 'translation' as the default namespace.

## Symbols

### `i18nConfig`
#### Description
An object that defines the configuration for i18next.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| fallbackLng | string | The fallback language to use if translations are missing |
| defaultNS | string | The default namespace for translations |

### `i18nSetupLocalization()`
#### Description
A function that initializes the i18next library with the React-i18next integration.

#### Inputs
This function doesn't take any inputs.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| void | void | This function doesn't return anything |

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses the `i18n` object from the i18next library.
2. Applies the `initReactI18next` plugin to integrate with React.
3. Initializes i18n with the `i18nConfig`.
4. Catches and logs any errors that occur during initialization.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| i18next | Internationalization framework |
| react-i18next | React integration for i18next |

## Error Handling
The `i18nSetupLocalization` function includes basic error handling. If the initialization fails, it logs an error message to the console along with the error details.

## References
The `i18nSetupLocalization` function is used in other parts of the application:

1. In `libs/copilot/src/appWrapper.tsx`, it's called before the `AppWrapper` component is defined.
2. In `frontend/src/main.tsx`, it's called before rendering the root React component.

This indicates that the localization setup is performed early in the application's lifecycle, ensuring that i18n is ready before the app renders.
