## High-level description
This TypeScript file contains utility functions for working with objects. It provides a function to check if a value is an object and another function to perform a deep equality comparison between two objects.

## Symbols

### `isObject`
#### Description
This function checks if the provided value is an object.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| object | any | The value to be checked |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| (return value) | boolean | `true` if the input is an object, `false` otherwise |

#### Internal Logic
The function checks two conditions:
1. The input is not null (or undefined)
2. The type of the input is 'object'

If both conditions are true, it returns `true`, otherwise `false`.

### `deepEqual`
#### Description
This exported function performs a deep equality comparison between two objects.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| object1 | Record&lt;string, any&gt; | The first object to compare |
| object2 | Record&lt;string, any&gt; | The second object to compare |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| (return value) | boolean | `true` if the objects are deeply equal, `false` otherwise |

#### Internal Logic
1. Compare the number of keys in both objects. If they're different, return `false`.
2. Iterate through the keys of the first object:
   - Get the corresponding values from both objects.
   - Check if both values are objects using the `isObject` function.
   - If both are objects, recursively call `deepEqual` on these nested objects.
   - If they're not objects, perform a strict equality comparison.
   - If any comparison fails, return `false`.
3. If all comparisons pass, return `true`.

## Performance Considerations
The `deepEqual` function uses recursion to compare nested objects. For deeply nested structures, this could potentially lead to stack overflow errors. Additionally, the time complexity increases with the depth and breadth of the objects being compared.

## Dependencies
This file has no external dependencies. It uses only built-in JavaScript/TypeScript features.

This utility file provides essential functions for object comparison, which can be particularly useful in scenarios where deep equality checks are needed, such as in state management systems or when comparing complex data structures in frontend applications.
