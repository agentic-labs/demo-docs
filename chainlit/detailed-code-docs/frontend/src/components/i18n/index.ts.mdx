## High-level description
This code exports a Translator component from a module in a React application. It serves as an entry point for internationalization (i18n) functionality, making the Translator component available for use in other parts of the application.

## Symbols

### `default as Translator`
#### Description
This is a named export that renames the default export from the './Translator' module to 'Translator'. It allows other parts of the application to import and use the Translator component for internationalization purposes.

## References
The code references the './Translator' module, which contains the actual implementation of the Translator component and related functionality.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| './Translator' | Provides the Translator component implementation |

While the target file itself is very simple, it's important to understand the context provided by the related code snippet (Translator.tsx). The Translator component and useTranslation hook defined in Translator.tsx are crucial for the internationalization functionality of the application.

The Translator component accepts a path to a translation key, options, and an optional suffix. It uses the react-i18next library to handle translations and falls back to a skeleton loading state if the translation doesn't exist.

The useTranslation hook is a custom wrapper around the react-i18next useTranslation hook, providing additional functionality such as checking for the existence of translations and returning a placeholder if the translation is not found.

By exporting the Translator component in this index file, the application makes it easy for other components to import and use the internationalization functionality without having to import directly from the Translator.tsx file.
