## High-level description
The `Readme` component is a React functional component that renders markdown content within a styled container. It's designed to display formatted text, potentially including HTML and LaTeX, in a responsive layout with scrolling capabilities.

## Code Structure
The `Readme` component is the main export of this file. It uses the `useLayoutMaxWidth` hook to determine the maximum width of the layout, and the `Markdown` component to render the markdown content.

### Readme
#### Description
A memoized React component that renders markdown content in a styled container. It supports optional HTML rendering and LaTeX formatting.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| markdown | string (optional) | The markdown content to be rendered |
| allowHtml | boolean (optional) | Flag to allow HTML content in the markdown |
| latex | boolean (optional) | Flag to enable LaTeX rendering |

#### Outputs
Returns a React element that renders the formatted markdown content or an empty box if no markdown is provided.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses the `useLayoutMaxWidth` hook to determine the maximum width for the layout.
2. If no markdown is provided, it returns an empty `Box` component that grows to fill available space.
3. If markdown is provided, it renders two nested `Box` components:
   - The outer `Box` provides scrolling capability and flexible growth.
   - The inner `Box` (with id "welcome-screen") applies styling and contains the `Markdown` component.
4. The `Markdown` component is used to render the actual markdown content, with `allowHtml` and `latex` props passed through.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react | For using React features like `memo` |
| @mui/material | For using Material-UI components (`Box`) |
| components/molecules/Markdown | For rendering markdown content |
| hooks/useLayoutMaxWidth | For determining the maximum layout width |

## Performance Considerations
The component is wrapped in `memo`, which can help prevent unnecessary re-renders if the props don't change. This is particularly useful if the parent component re-renders frequently but the markdown content remains the same.

## API/Interface Reference
This component is designed to be used as a child component, likely within a larger page or layout. It expects to receive markdown content and rendering options as props.

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| markdown | string | undefined | The markdown content to be rendered |
| allowHtml | boolean | undefined | Whether to allow HTML in the markdown |
| latex | boolean | undefined | Whether to enable LaTeX rendering |

Note: The component uses a specific font stack and styling to match GitHub's markdown rendering style.
