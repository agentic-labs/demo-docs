## High-level description
The `FeedbackSelect` component is a React component that provides a dropdown menu for filtering thread history based on feedback (positive, negative, or all). It uses Material-UI components and Recoil for state management, allowing users to select and apply feedback filters to the thread history.

## Code Structure
The main component `FeedbackSelect` uses several hooks and Material-UI components to create an interactive dropdown menu. It interacts with the `threadsFiltersState` from the Recoil state management system to update and reflect the current filter state.

## Symbols

### `FeedbackSelect`
#### Description
This is the main functional component that renders a dropdown menu for selecting feedback filters.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses Recoil's `useRecoilState` to manage the filters state.
2. Uses React's `useState` to manage the anchor element for the dropdown menu.
3. Utilizes the `useTranslation` hook for internationalization.
4. Defines a `handleChange` function to update the filters when a selection is made.
5. Renders different icons based on the current filter selection.
6. Renders a dropdown menu with options for All, Positive, and Negative feedback.

#### Side Effects
Updates the `threadsFiltersState` when a filter option is selected.

### `Feedback` (enum)
#### Description
An enumeration defining the possible feedback values.

| Name | Value | Description |
|:-----|:------|:------------|
| POSITIVE | 1 | Represents positive feedback |
| NEGATIVE | 0 | Represents negative feedback |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react | Core React library |
| recoil | State management |
| @mui/material | UI components |
| @mui/icons-material | Icons |
| components/i18n/Translator | Internationalization |
| state/threads | Recoil state for thread filters |

## Internationalization
The component uses the `useTranslation` hook to provide translated labels for the filter options. The translation keys used are:
- `components.organisms.threadHistory.sidebar.filters.FeedbackSelect.feedbackAll`
- `components.organisms.threadHistory.sidebar.filters.FeedbackSelect.feedbackPositive`
- `components.organisms.threadHistory.sidebar.filters.FeedbackSelect.feedbackNegative`

## Performance Considerations
The component uses `React.memo` implicitly (as it's a functional component), which can help prevent unnecessary re-renders if the parent component re-renders but the props haven't changed.
