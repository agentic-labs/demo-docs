title: "Thread.tsx"
---

## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `Thread` that displays a historical chat thread. It renders messages, handles feedback updates, and provides a user interface for viewing past conversations.

## Code Structure
The `Thread` component is the main export. It uses various hooks and components from React, Material-UI, and custom libraries. The component manages the state of steps (messages) in the thread and provides callbacks for updating and deleting feedback.

## Symbols

### `Thread`
#### Description
A React component that renders a historical chat thread.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| thread | IThread | The thread data to display |
| error | Error | Any error that occurred while fetching the thread |
| isLoading | boolean | Indicates if the thread is still loading |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes state and hooks for managing the thread data and UI.
2. Renders a loading skeleton if `isLoading` is true.
3. Displays an alert with thread creation date and a back button.
4. Renders the messages using `MessageContainer` component.
5. Provides callbacks for updating and deleting feedback.

### `onFeedbackUpdated`
#### Description
A callback function to update feedback for a message.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| message | IStep | The message to update feedback for |
| onSuccess | () =&gt; void | Callback to execute on successful update |
| feedback | IFeedback | The new feedback data |

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls the API to set feedback.
2. Updates the local state with the new feedback.
3. Displays a toast notification for success or error.

### `onFeedbackDeleted`
#### Description
A callback function to delete feedback for a message.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| message | IStep | The message to delete feedback from |
| onSuccess | () =&gt; void | Callback to execute on successful deletion |
| feedbackId | string | The ID of the feedback to delete |

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls the API to delete feedback.
2. Updates the local state by removing the feedback.
3. Displays a toast notification for success or error.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react | Core React library |
| react-i18next | Internationalization |
| react-router-dom | Routing |
| recoil | State management |
| sonner | Toast notifications |
| @mui/material | UI components |
| @chainlit/react-client | Custom client library |

## Error Handling
The component handles errors by not rendering anything if there's an error or if the thread is undefined. It also uses toast notifications to display errors during feedback operations.

## Performance Considerations
The component uses `useCallback` for memoizing functions to prevent unnecessary re-renders. It also conditionally renders content based on loading state and thread availability.
