## High-level description
This directory contains components for filtering and searching thread history in a sidebar. It includes a search bar, a feedback selection dropdown, and a main component that combines these filters.

## What does it do?
The components in this directory work together to provide users with the ability to filter and search through their thread history. Users can:

1. Search for specific threads using a text input field.
2. Filter threads based on feedback (positive, negative, or all).

These filtering options help users quickly find relevant threads in their history, improving the overall user experience and navigation within the application.

## Key Files

### FeedbackSelect.tsx
This file contains the `FeedbackSelect` component, which renders a dropdown menu for filtering thread history based on feedback (positive, negative, or all). It uses Material-UI components and Recoil for state management.

Key features:
- Uses Recoil to manage the filters state
- Provides options for All, Positive, and Negative feedback
- Updates the `threadsFiltersState` when a filter option is selected
- Supports internationalization using the `useTranslation` hook

### SearchBar.tsx
This file defines the `SearchBar` component, which provides a text input field for searching threads. It includes debounced input handling and a clear button.

Key features:
- Uses Recoil to manage the search filter state
- Implements debounced search input handling (300ms delay)
- Provides a clear button to reset the search
- Uses custom styling based on the current theme
- Supports internationalization for the placeholder text

### index.tsx
This file contains the main `Filters` component, which combines the `SearchBar` and `FeedbackSelect` components into a single horizontal layout.

Key features:
- Uses Material-UI's `Stack` component for layout
- Arranges `SearchBar` and `FeedbackSelect` horizontally with a small gap

## Dependencies
The components in this directory rely on the following external libraries and frameworks:

1. React (v18.2.0 or compatible): Core library for building user interfaces
2. Recoil (v0.7.7 or compatible): State management library for React applications
3. Material-UI (v5.x): React component library for consistent and customizable UI
   - @mui/material: Core components
   - @mui/icons-material: Icon components
4. Lodash (v4.x): Utility library, used for the debounce function in SearchBar
5. i18next (v22.x): Internationalization framework for React applications

These dependencies were chosen to provide a robust and efficient solution for building interactive and responsive UI components with state management and internationalization support.

## Configuration
The components in this directory do not require specific configuration files or environment variables. However, they interact with the global state managed by Recoil, specifically the `threadsFiltersState`. This state should be properly set up in the application's Recoil configuration.

The internationalization keys used in these components should be defined in the application's translation files. The keys used are:

- `components.organisms.threadHistory.sidebar.filters.FeedbackSelect.feedbackAll`
- `components.organisms.threadHistory.sidebar.filters.FeedbackSelect.feedbackPositive`
- `components.organisms.threadHistory.sidebar.filters.FeedbackSelect.feedbackNegative`
- `components.organisms.threadHistory.sidebar.filters.SearchBar.placeholder`

Ensure that these keys are properly defined in your translation files for all supported languages.
