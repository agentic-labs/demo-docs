## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `Filters` that renders a horizontal stack of two filter components: `SearchBar` and `FeedbackSelect`. These components are used to filter and search through thread history in a sidebar.

## Code Structure
The `Filters` component imports and uses two custom components, `SearchBar` and `FeedbackSelect`, along with the `Stack` component from Material-UI. These components are arranged horizontally within the `Stack`.

## Symbols

## Related Components

### `SearchBar`
A text input component that allows users to search through threads. It uses debounced input to update the search filter in the global state.

### `FeedbackSelect`
A dropdown component that allows users to filter threads based on feedback (positive, negative, or all). It updates the feedback filter in the global state.

These related components are crucial for understanding the full functionality of the `Filters` component, as they provide the actual filtering capabilities that `Filters` arranges in the UI.
