## High-level description
The `DeleteThreadButton` component is a React component that provides functionality to delete a thread in a chat application. It displays a delete button that, when clicked, opens a confirmation dialog. Upon confirmation, it triggers the deletion process and shows toast notifications for the operation's progress and result.

## Code Structure
The main component `DeleteThreadButton` uses several hooks and Material-UI components to manage its state and UI. It interacts with an API client to perform the deletion operation and uses a toast notification system to provide feedback to the user.

### DeleteThreadButton
#### Description
A functional component that renders a delete button and handles the thread deletion process.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| threadId | string | The ID of the thread to be deleted |
| onDelete | function | Callback function to be called after successful deletion |

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses `useState` to manage the open state of the confirmation dialog.
2. Retrieves the access token and API client from Recoil state and context.
3. Handles opening and closing of the confirmation dialog.
4. Implements `handleConfirm` to trigger the thread deletion process:
   - Uses `toast.promise` to show loading, success, and error states.
   - Calls `apiClient.deleteThread` with the thread ID and access token.
   - Invokes the `onDelete` callback on successful deletion.
   - Handles potential `ClientError` in case of failure.

#### Outputs
Renders an IconButton that opens a confirmation dialog when clicked. The dialog contains options to cancel or confirm the deletion.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react | Core React library |
| recoil | State management |
| sonner | Toast notifications |
| @mui/icons-material | Material-UI icons |
| @mui/lab | Material-UI lab components |
| @mui/material | Material-UI components |
| @chainlit/react-client | Chainlit client utilities |
| components/i18n | Internationalization component |

## Error Handling
The component handles potential errors during the deletion process by catching and displaying them in the toast notification. It specifically checks for `ClientError` instances to display custom error messages.

## Internationalization
The component uses a `Translator` component for internationalized text, allowing for easy localization of UI strings.

## Performance Considerations
The component uses React hooks efficiently, avoiding unnecessary re-renders. The deletion process is handled asynchronously, preventing UI blocking during the API call.

This component is designed to be a reusable and self-contained unit for thread deletion functionality within a larger chat application interface.
