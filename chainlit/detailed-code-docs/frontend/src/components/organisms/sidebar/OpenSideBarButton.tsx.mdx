## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `OpenSideBarButton` that renders a button to open or close a sidebar. The button consists of two vertical bars that rotate on hover, providing a visual cue for the user. The component uses Material-UI (MUI) components and includes a tooltip with translated text.

## Symbols

### OpenSideBarButton
#### Description
A functional React component that renders a button to toggle the sidebar open/closed state.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| onClick | () =&gt; void | Function to be called when the button is clicked |
| open | boolean | Current state of the sidebar (open or closed) |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSX.Element | React element | The rendered button component |

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses the `useTranslation` hook to access translation functions.
2. Renders a `Tooltip` component with translated text based on the `open` state.
3. Inside the tooltip, renders a `Box` component that acts as the button.
4. The button contains two child `Box` components styled as vertical bars.
5. Applies hover effects to rotate the bars based on the `open` state.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @mui/material | Provides UI components (Box, Tooltip) |
| components/i18n/Translator | Provides translation functionality |

## References
- The `useTranslation` hook is imported from `components/i18n/Translator`, which is defined in the related file `frontend/src/components/i18n/Translator.tsx`.
- This component is used in the `SideBar` component defined in `frontend/src/components/organisms/sidebar/index.tsx`.

## Side Effects
The component doesn't have any side effects beyond rendering UI elements and responding to user interactions.

## Performance Considerations
The component uses inline styles and the `sx` prop for styling, which may have a slight performance impact compared to using styled components or external CSS. However, for this small component, the impact is likely negligible.
