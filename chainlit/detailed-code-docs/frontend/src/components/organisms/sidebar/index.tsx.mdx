## High-level description
This code defines a `SideBar` component for a React application. It implements a drawer-style sidebar that can be toggled open and closed, displaying chat history, a logo, and buttons for accessing the README and GitHub repository. The sidebar adapts its behavior based on screen size and user authentication status.

## Code Structure
The `SideBar` component is the main export. It uses various Material-UI components and custom components to create the sidebar structure. The component's state is managed using Recoil, and it interacts with authentication and configuration data from custom hooks.

## References
- `settingsState` from 'state/settings'
- `useAuth`, `useConfig` from '@chainlit/react-client'
- `GithubButton`, `Logo`, `ReadmeButton`, `TriggerButton`, `ThreadHistory` from various local components

### `SideBar`
#### Description
The main component that renders the sidebar with its contents.

#### Inputs
No direct inputs, but it uses various hooks and state management.

#### Internal Logic
1. Determines if the view is mobile using a media query.
2. Manages the sidebar's open/closed state using Recoil state.
3. Determines if chat history should be enabled based on user authentication and data persistence configuration.
4. Renders a drawer with conditional content based on the sidebar's state and screen size.
5. Includes a trigger button for non-mobile views to toggle the sidebar.

#### Side Effects
- Updates the `settingsState` when toggling the sidebar open/closed.
- Automatically closes the sidebar on mobile devices.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| React | Core library for building the component |
| Recoil | State management |
| Material-UI | UI components and styling |
| @chainlit/react-client | Custom hooks for authentication and configuration |

## Performance Considerations
The component uses `useMediaQuery` to determine if the view is mobile, which may cause re-renders on window resizing. The `useEffect` hook is used to manage the sidebar's open/closed state based on screen size and history enablement, which helps optimize performance by avoiding unnecessary updates.
