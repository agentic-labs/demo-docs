## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `InputHistoryButton` that displays a button to show the user's input history. When clicked, it opens a menu with a list of previous user inputs, organized by date and time. The component uses Material-UI for styling and Recoil for state management.

## Code Structure
The main component `InputHistoryButton` uses several helper functions and sub-components:
- `buildInputHistory`: Organizes the input history by date and time.
- Various Material-UI components for rendering the menu and its items.
- Recoil state management for handling the input history state.

## Symbols

### InputHistoryButton
#### Description
The main component that renders the input history button and its associated menu.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| onClick | function | Callback function to handle clicking on a history item |

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses Recoil to manage the input history state.
2. Renders a menu with the input history when opened.
3. Organizes the history items by date and time.
4. Allows clearing the entire history.
5. Handles clicking on history items to reuse previous inputs.

### buildInputHistory
#### Description
A helper function that organizes the user inputs into a structured format by date and time.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| userInputs | UserInput[] | Array of user input objects |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| inputHistory | Record&lt;string, Array&gt; | Organized input history by date |

#### Internal Logic
1. Reverses the input array to show most recent first.
2. Groups inputs by date.
3. Formats the time for each input.
4. Removes duplicate consecutive inputs.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| lodash/cloneDeep | Deep cloning of objects |
| react | React library for building UI |
| recoil | State management library |
| @mui/material | Material-UI components |
| @mui/icons-material | Material-UI icons |
| @chainlit/react-client | Custom types (UserInput) |

## Error Handling
The component doesn't implement specific error handling mechanisms. It relies on React's error boundaries for catching and handling runtime errors.

## Performance Considerations
The component uses `cloneDeep` from lodash, which can be expensive for large objects. Consider using a more efficient method if performance becomes an issue with large input histories.

## TODOs
- There are several `@ts-ignore` comments in the code, indicating potential TypeScript issues that should be addressed.
- Consider implementing virtualization for large input histories to improve performance.

This component provides a user-friendly way to access and reuse previous inputs in a chat-like interface, enhancing the user experience by allowing quick access to past interactions.
