## High-level description
This code defines a `SubmitButton` component for a chat interface. It renders either a "Send" button or a "Stop" button based on the current chat state, using Material-UI components and icons.

## Code Structure
The `SubmitButton` component uses custom hooks (`useChatData`, `useChatInteract`, `useChatMessages`) to access chat-related state and functions. It conditionally renders different buttons based on the chat state, wrapping them in tooltips for user guidance.

## References
- Material-UI components: `Box`, `IconButton`, `Tooltip`
- Material-UI icons: `StopCircle`, `Telegram`
- Custom hooks: `useChatData`, `useChatInteract`, `useChatMessages`
- Custom component: `Translator`

### SubmitButton
#### Description
A React component that renders a submit button for a chat interface. It switches between a "Send" and "Stop" button based on the chat state.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| disabled | boolean (optional) | Determines if the button should be disabled |
| onSubmit | function | Callback function to be called when the submit button is clicked |

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses custom hooks to get chat state and functions.
2. Renders a "Stop" button if the chat is loading and it's not the first interaction.
3. Otherwise, renders a "Send" button.
4. Both buttons are wrapped in tooltips with translated text.
5. The "Send" button is disabled based on the `disabled` prop.
6. The "Stop" button calls the `stopTask` function when clicked.
