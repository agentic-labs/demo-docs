## High-level description
This code defines a `WaterMark` component in React, which renders a clickable logo and text linking to the Chainlit GitHub repository. The component adapts its appearance based on the current theme (light or dark) of the application.

## Code Structure
The `WaterMark` component is the main and only symbol in this file. It uses hooks and components from external libraries and other parts of the application to render the watermark.

## References
- `useRecoilValue` from 'recoil'
- `Stack`, `Typography` from '@mui/material'
- `Translator` from 'components/i18n'
- `LogoDark` and `LogoLight` from SVG assets
- `settingsState` from 'state/settings'
