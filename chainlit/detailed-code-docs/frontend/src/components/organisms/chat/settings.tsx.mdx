## High-level description
This code defines a React component `ChatSettingsModal` that renders a dialog for chat settings. It uses Formik for form management, Recoil for state management, and Material-UI for UI components. The component allows users to view, edit, and reset chat settings.

## Code Structure
The main component `ChatSettingsModal` uses several hooks and components to manage its state and render the UI. It interacts with the chat data and settings through custom hooks `useChatData` and `useChatInteract`.

- `AccentButton` and `RegularButton` from 'components/atoms/buttons'
- `FormInput` from 'components/atoms/inputs'
