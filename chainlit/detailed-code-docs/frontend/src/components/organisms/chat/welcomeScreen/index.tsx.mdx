## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `WelcomeScreen` that displays a welcome screen for a chat interface. It shows a logo, chat profile information, and a grid of starter messages that users can select to begin a conversation.

## Code Structure
The main `WelcomeScreen` component uses several hooks from React and custom hooks from the Chainlit library. It renders a layout with a logo (if not hidden), and a grid of starter messages. The component is responsive and uses Material-UI components for styling.

## References
- `ChainlitContext`: Used to access the API client.
- `useChatMessages`, `useChatSession`, `useConfig`: Custom hooks from Chainlit for managing chat state and configuration.
- `Starter`: A sub-component defined in a separate file for rendering individual starter messages.

## Symbols

### `hasMessage`
#### Description
A helper function that checks if there are any valid messages in the given array of steps.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| messages | IStep[] | An array of message steps to check |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| (return value) | boolean | True if valid messages are found, false otherwise |

#### Internal Logic
It recursively checks for messages of type 'user_message' or 'assistant_message' in the given array and its nested steps.

### `WelcomeScreen`
#### Description
The main component that renders the welcome screen.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| hideLogo | boolean (optional) | Whether to hide the logo |

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses various hooks to get chat messages, session data, and configuration.
2. Determines whether to show the welcome screen based on the presence of messages.
3. Selects the appropriate chat profile and its associated logo.
4. Determines the starters to display based on the selected chat profile or global configuration.
5. Renders a fade-in animation with the logo (if not hidden) and a grid of starter messages.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| React | Core library for building the component |
| @mui/material | UI component library for styling |
| @chainlit/react-client | Custom hooks and context for chat functionality |

## Performance Considerations
The component uses `useMemo` to memoize the computation of the logo and starters, which helps optimize performance by avoiding unnecessary re-renders.
