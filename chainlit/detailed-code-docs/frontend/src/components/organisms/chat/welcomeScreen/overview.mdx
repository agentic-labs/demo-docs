## High-level description
This directory contains React components that make up the welcome screen for a chat interface. The main components are `WelcomeScreen` and `Starter`, which work together to create an interactive and user-friendly entry point for initiating conversations in the chat application.

## What does it do?
The welcome screen serves as the initial interface for users when they start using the chat application. It provides a visually appealing layout with the following features:

1. Displays a logo (if not hidden) to represent the chat application or the selected chat profile.
2. Shows chat profile information to give context to the user about the current conversation environment.
3. Presents a grid of starter messages, which are pre-defined conversation topics or questions that users can select to begin chatting.

When a user clicks on one of the starter messages, it automatically sends that message to start the conversation, making it easy for users to engage with the chat system without having to think of an initial message themselves.

## Key Files

### index.tsx
This file contains the main `WelcomeScreen` component, which is responsible for rendering the overall layout of the welcome screen. It handles the following tasks:

- Determines whether to show the welcome screen based on the presence of existing messages.
- Selects the appropriate chat profile and its associated logo.
- Renders the logo (if not hidden) with a fade-in animation.
- Creates a grid of starter messages using the `Starter` component.

### starter.tsx
This file defines the `Starter` component, which represents individual starter messages on the welcome screen. Each `Starter` component:

- Renders as a styled button with the starter message's label and an optional icon.
- Handles the click event to send the predefined message and initiate the conversation.

## Dependencies
The components in this directory rely on several external libraries and frameworks:

1. React (v18.2.0 or compatible): The core library for building the user interface components.
2. Material-UI (@mui/material, version not specified): Provides UI components and styling utilities for creating a consistent and attractive design.
3. @chainlit/react-client (version not specified): A custom library that provides hooks and context for managing chat functionality, including:
   - `useChatMessages`: For accessing and managing chat messages.
   - `useChatSession`: For managing the current chat session.
   - `useConfig`: For accessing application configuration.
   - `useChatInteract`: For interacting with the chat (e.g., sending messages).
   - `useChatData`: For accessing chat-related data.
   - `useAuth`: For handling authentication state.

4. uuid (version not specified): Used for generating unique identifiers for messages.

These dependencies were likely chosen to provide a robust foundation for building a modern, interactive chat interface with efficient state management and consistent styling.

## Configuration
The components in this directory use configuration data accessed through the `useConfig` hook from the Chainlit library. This configuration likely includes:

- Settings for displaying or hiding the logo.
- Default starter messages to display when no specific chat profile is selected.
- Chat profile information, including associated logos and custom starter messages.

The exact structure of the configuration is not visible in the provided code snippets, but it plays a crucial role in determining the content and appearance of the welcome screen.

## Code Examples

Here's a simplified example of how the `WelcomeScreen` component might be structured:

```jsx
function WelcomeScreen({ hideLogo = false }) {
  const { messages } = useChatMessages();
  const { chatProfile } = useChatSession();
  const { config } = useConfig();

  const showWelcomeScreen = useMemo(() =&gt; !hasMessage(messages), [messages]);

  const logo = useMemo(() =&gt; {
    // Logic to determine the logo based on chat profile or config
  }, [chatProfile, config]);

  const starters = useMemo(() =&gt; {
    // Logic to determine starters based on chat profile or config
  }, [chatProfile, config]);

  if (!showWelcomeScreen) return null;

  return (
    &lt;Fade in={showWelcomeScreen} timeout={1000}&gt;
      &lt;Box&gt;
        {!hideLogo && &lt;Logo src={logo} /&gt;}
        &lt;Grid container spacing={2}&gt;
          {starters.map((starter) =&gt; (
            &lt;Grid item key={starter.id}&gt;
              &lt;Starter starter={starter} /&gt;
            &lt;/Grid&gt;
          ))}
        &lt;/Grid&gt;
      &lt;/Box&gt;
    &lt;/Fade&gt;
  );
}
```

And here's a simplified example of the `Starter` component:

```jsx
function Starter({ starter }) {
  const { sendMessage } = useChatInteract();

  const onSubmit = useCallback(() =&gt; {
    const message = {
      id: uuidv4(),
      content: starter.message,
      type: 'user_message',
    };
    sendMessage(message, []);
  }, [starter, sendMessage]);

  return (
    &lt;Button onClick={onSubmit} sx={/* Custom styles */}&gt;
      {starter.icon && &lt;StarterIcon&gt;{starter.icon}&lt;/StarterIcon&gt;}
      &lt;Typography&gt;{starter.label}&lt;/Typography&gt;
    &lt;/Button&gt;
  );
}
```

These components work together to create an engaging and user-friendly welcome screen that helps users quickly start conversations in the chat application.
