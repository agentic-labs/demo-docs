## High-level description
This code defines a `FormInput` component that serves as a unified interface for various input types in a form. It dynamically renders different input components based on the `type` property of the input element, providing a flexible and reusable solution for form creation in a React application.

## Code Structure
The code defines several types and interfaces to structure the input props, and then uses a switch statement in the `FormInput` component to render the appropriate input component based on the `type` property. It imports and uses several custom input components (SelectInput, SliderInput, TagsInput, TextInput, SwitchInput) to handle different input types.

## Symbols

### FormInput
#### Description
A React component that renders different types of form inputs based on the `type` property of the input element.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| element | TFormInput | An object containing properties for the input element, including its type and value |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSX.Element | React component | The rendered input component |

#### Internal Logic
The component uses a switch statement to determine which input component to render based on the `type` property of the `element` prop. It then spreads the relevant properties to the chosen input component, handling any necessary value conversions or prop omissions.

### IFormInput
#### Description
An interface that extends `IInput` and adds properties specific to form inputs.

### TFormInput
#### Description
A union type that combines properties of various input components with `IFormInput`, creating a comprehensive type for different form input scenarios.

### TFormInputValue
#### Description
A type alias representing the possible values a form input can have.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| omit | A utility function to remove specified properties from an object |
| IInput | An interface defining common properties for input components |
| SliderInput, SwitchInput, TagsInput, TextInput, SelectInput | Custom input components used by FormInput |

## Notes
- The code uses TypeScript to ensure type safety across different input types.
- The `omit` function is used to remove the `setField` prop from certain input components to avoid React warnings.
- The component handles default values for each input type when the `value` prop is undefined.
- There's a fallback case in the switch statement that satisfies the `never` type, ensuring all possible types are handled.

This component provides a flexible and type-safe way to render various form inputs in a React application, making it easier to create and manage complex forms with different input types.
