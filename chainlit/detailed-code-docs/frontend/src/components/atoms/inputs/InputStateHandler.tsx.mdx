## High-level description
The `InputStateHandler` component is a reusable React component that manages the state and layout of input fields. It provides a consistent structure for various input types, handling labels, error states, and descriptions. This component serves as a wrapper for different input elements, ensuring a uniform appearance and behavior across the application.

## Code Structure
The `InputStateHandler` component is defined as a function that takes `InputStateHandlerProps` as its argument. It uses Material-UI components to structure the layout of the input field, including the label, the actual input (passed as children), and any additional description or error messages.

## Symbols

### InputStateHandler
#### Description
This function component renders a structured input field with optional label, description, and error state handling.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| props | InputStateHandlerProps | An object containing the properties for the input field |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSX.Element | React component | The rendered input field structure |

#### Internal Logic
1. Destructure the props to access individual properties.
2. Render a `Stack` component to vertically arrange the input elements.
3. Conditionally render an `InputLabel` if a label is provided.
4. Render a `FormControl` component to wrap the input and handle error states.
5. Render the children (actual input component) within the `FormControl`.
6. Conditionally render a `FormHelperText` if a description is provided.

### InputStateHandlerProps
#### Description
This type defines the props for the `InputStateHandler` component, extending the `IInput` interface.

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| children | React.ReactNode | The actual input component to be rendered |
| sx | SxProps (optional) | Custom styles for the component |
| (other props from IInput) | various | Properties inherited from the IInput interface |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @mui/material | Provides UI components and styling utilities |
| types/Input | Imports the IInput interface for input field properties |
| ./InputLabel | Imports the InputLabel component for rendering labels |

## References
The `InputStateHandler` component is used in various other input components throughout the application, such as:
- TextInput
- TagsInput
- SelectInput
- SliderInput
- Toggle

These components wrap their specific input elements with `InputStateHandler` to maintain consistency in layout and behavior.

## Side Effects
The component does not have any notable side effects. It primarily focuses on rendering and structuring the input field based on the provided props.
