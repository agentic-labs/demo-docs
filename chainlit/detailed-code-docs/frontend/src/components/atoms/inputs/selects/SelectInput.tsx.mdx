## High-level description
The `SelectInput` component is a customizable select input for React applications. It extends Material-UI's Select component, adding features like icons, notification counts, and custom styling. It's designed to work with dark and light themes and integrates with other custom components like `InputStateHandler`.

## Code Structure
The main `SelectInput` component uses several helper components and hooks:
- `InputStateHandler`: Manages the input's state, including labels and error handling.
- `MenuItem`: A custom menu item component for the select options.
- `useIsDarkMode`: A custom hook to determine if the dark mode is active.

The component also imports various Material-UI components and styles to create its UI.

### SelectInput
#### Description
A customizable select input component that extends Material-UI's Select component with additional features and styling options.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| children | React.ReactNode | Child components to be rendered inside the select |
| items | SelectItem[] | Array of items to be displayed in the select |
| value | string \| number | The current selected value |
| onChange | (e: SelectChangeEvent) =&gt; void | Function to handle value changes |
| placeholder | string | Placeholder text when no item is selected |
| disabled | boolean | Whether the select is disabled |
| size | 'small' \| 'medium' | Size of the select input |
| onItemMouseEnter | (e: MouseEvent&lt;HTMLLIElement&gt;, itemName: string) =&gt; void | Function to handle mouse enter on items |
| onItemMouseLeave | (e: MouseEvent&lt;HTMLLIElement&gt;) =&gt; void | Function to handle mouse leave on items |

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses `useState` to manage the open/close state of the select menu.
2. Utilizes `useIsDarkMode` hook to apply appropriate styling based on the current theme.
3. Renders the selected value or placeholder text using a custom `renderValue` function.
4. Applies custom styling to the select input and its menu items.
5. Handles mouse enter/leave events on menu items for potential hover effects.

### SelectItem
#### Description
Defines the structure of items used in the SelectInput component.

#### Properties
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| label | string | Display text for the item |
| icon | JSX.Element | Optional icon to display with the item |
| notificationCount | number | Optional notification count to display |
| value | string \| number | Value associated with the item |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @mui/material | Provides UI components and styling utilities |
| @mui/icons-material | Provides icons for the component |
| react | Core React library |

## Performance Considerations
The component uses `useState` to manage the open/close state of the select menu, which could potentially cause re-renders. However, this is a common and generally efficient approach for managing UI state in React components.

## Error Handling
Error handling is primarily managed through the `InputStateHandler` component, which can display error messages and handle error states.

## API/Interface Reference
The `SelectInput` component exposes the following main props interface:

| Prop | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| items | SelectItem[] | Array of items to be displayed in the select |
| onChange | (e: SelectChangeEvent) =&gt; void | Function to handle value changes |
| value | string \| number | The current selected value |
| placeholder | string | Placeholder text when no item is selected |
| disabled | boolean | Whether the select is disabled |
| size | 'small' \| 'medium' | Size of the select input |

This component is designed to be flexible and customizable, allowing for easy integration into various parts of a React application that require select input functionality.
