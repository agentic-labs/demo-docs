## High-level description
This directory contains components for creating customizable select inputs in a React application. It includes three main components: `MenuItem`, `SelectCategoryInput`, and `SelectInput`. These components work together to provide a flexible and feature-rich select input system that supports icons, notification counts, categorization, and dark mode compatibility.

## What does it do?
The components in this directory allow developers to create advanced select inputs for their React applications. Here's what each component does:

1. `MenuItem`: This component creates customized menu items for select inputs. It can display icons, labels, and notification counts, and adapts its styling based on whether it's selected and whether dark mode is active.

2. `SelectCategoryInput`: This component creates a select input where options are organized into categories. It groups items under category headers, providing a hierarchical structure to the select options.

3. `SelectInput`: This is the main select input component. It extends Material-UI's Select component with additional features like custom styling, icon support, and notification counts. It's designed to work seamlessly with both dark and light themes.

Together, these components allow developers to create select inputs that can handle complex data structures, provide visual cues through icons and notification counts, and maintain a consistent look and feel across different theme modes.

## Key Files

1. `MenuItem.tsx`: 
   - Defines the `MenuItem` component used in select inputs.
   - Supports icons, labels, and notification counts.
   - Adapts styling based on selection state and dark mode.

2. `SelectCategoryInput.tsx`:
   - Implements the `SelectCategoryInput` component for categorized select options.
   - Uses `SelectInput` as its base and enhances it with category-specific rendering.
   - Provides a hierarchical selection interface.

3. `SelectInput.tsx`:
   - Contains the main `SelectInput` component.
   - Extends Material-UI's Select component with additional features.
   - Manages the open/close state of the select menu.
   - Handles custom rendering of selected values and placeholder text.

## Dependencies
The components in this directory rely on several external libraries and internal modules:

1. @mui/material (version not specified):
   - Provides core UI components like Select, MenuItem, and Stack.
   - Chosen for its comprehensive set of pre-built React components and theming capabilities.

2. @mui/icons-material (version not specified):
   - Supplies icons used in the select inputs.
   - Chosen for its extensive icon set that integrates well with Material-UI components.

3. react (version not specified):
   - Core React library for building user interfaces.

4. Internal dependencies:
   - `useIsDarkMode` hook: Used to determine the current theme mode.
   - `InputStateHandler` component: Manages input state, including labels and error handling.
   - `NotificationCount` component: Renders notification counts in menu items.

These dependencies were likely chosen to provide a robust foundation for building complex UI components while maintaining consistency with Material Design principles and easy theme customization.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files in this directory, the components are designed to be highly configurable through props. Key configurable aspects include:

1. `SelectInput`:
   - `items`: Array of `SelectItem` objects defining the options.
   - `value`: The currently selected value.
   - `onChange`: Function to handle value changes.
   - `placeholder`: Text to display when no item is selected.
   - `disabled`: Boolean to disable the select input.
   - `size`: 'small' or 'medium' to set the input size.

2. `SelectCategoryInput`:
   - `items`: Array of `CategoryItem` objects for categorized options.
   - Inherits most props from `SelectInput`.

3. `MenuItem`:
   - `item`: The `SelectItem` object to display.
   - `selected`: Boolean indicating if the item is selected.
   - `isDarkMode`: Boolean for dark mode styling.
   - `icon`: Optional JSX element for an icon.

These configurable props allow developers to customize the behavior and appearance of the select inputs to fit their specific use cases.

Example usage of `SelectInput`:

```jsx
&lt;SelectInput
  items={[
    { label: 'Option 1', value: '1', icon: &lt;Icon1 /&gt;, notificationCount: 3 },
    { label: 'Option 2', value: '2', icon: &lt;Icon2 /&gt; },
  ]}
  value={selectedValue}
  onChange={handleChange}
  placeholder="Select an option"
  size="medium"
/&gt;
```

Example usage of `SelectCategoryInput`:

```jsx
&lt;SelectCategoryInput
  items={[
    {
      header: 'Category 1',
      items: [
        { label: 'Option 1', value: '1' },
        { label: 'Option 2', value: '2' },
      ],
    },
    {
      header: 'Category 2',
      items: [
        { label: 'Option 3', value: '3' },
        { label: 'Option 4', value: '4' },
      ],
    },
  ]}
  value={selectedValue}
  onChange={handleChange}
  placeholder="Select a categorized option"
/&gt;
```

These components provide a flexible and feature-rich system for creating select inputs in React applications, with support for categorization, icons, notification counts, and theme-aware styling.
