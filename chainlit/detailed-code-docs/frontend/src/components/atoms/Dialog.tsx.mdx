## Notes
- The component uses the spread operator to pass through any additional props to the Material-UI Dialog component.

- Custom styling is applied using the `sx` prop, which is a Material-UI feature for applying styles inline.

This Dialog component provides a flexible and reusable way to create dialogs in a React application, with easy customization of title, content, and actions while maintaining a consistent look and feel.
