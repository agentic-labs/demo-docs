## High-level description
This code defines a `GithubButton` component in React, which renders a button linking to a GitHub repository. The button is conditionally rendered based on the presence of a GitHub URL in the application's configuration.

## Code Structure
The `GithubButton` component is the main export of this file. It uses the `useConfig` hook to access the application's configuration and the Material-UI `Button` component for rendering.

## References
- `Button` and `ButtonProps` from '@mui/material'
- `GithubIcon` from 'assets/github'
- `useConfig` from 'client-types/*'

### GithubButton
#### Description
A functional component that renders a button linking to a GitHub repository. The button is only rendered if a GitHub URL is provided in the application's configuration.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| props | ButtonProps | Props to be passed to the underlying Material-UI Button component |

#### Outputs
Returns a React element (Button) or null if no GitHub URL is configured.

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the application configuration using the `useConfig` hook.
2. Extracts the GitHub URL from the configuration.
3. If no GitHub URL is present, returns null (no button is rendered).
4. Otherwise, renders a Material-UI Button with the following characteristics:
   - Links to the provided GitHub URL
   - Opens in a new tab
   - Uses the inherited color
   - Has custom styling for justification and text transformation
   - Includes a GitHub icon as a start icon
   - Displays "Repo" as the button text

## Side Effects
This component does not have any side effects beyond rendering UI elements.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @mui/material | Provides the Button component and ButtonProps type |
| assets/github | Provides the GithubIcon component |
| client-types/* | Provides the useConfig hook |

## Error Handling
The component includes a TypeScript expect-error comment to suppress a type error related to the `href` prop on the Button component. This suggests that the type definitions for the Button component might not include `href` as a valid prop, even though it's being used here.

## Notes
1. The component uses a custom `Props` interface that extends `ButtonProps`, allowing it to accept all standard Button props.
2. The use of the spread operator `{...props}` allows any additional props to be passed through to the underlying Button component.
3. The component is designed to be flexible and reusable, as it can be customized through props while maintaining a consistent base appearance and behavior.
