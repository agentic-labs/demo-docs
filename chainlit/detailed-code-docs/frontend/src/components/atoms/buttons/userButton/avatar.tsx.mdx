## High-level description
This code defines a `UserAvatar` component that displays a user's avatar or a default user icon within an `IconButton`. It utilizes the user's authentication information to show either their profile image, initials, or a generic user icon.

## Code Structure
The `UserAvatar` component is the main export of this file. It uses the `useAuth` hook from `@chainlit/react-client` to access user information and renders an `Avatar` component from Material-UI.

## References
- `useAuth` hook from `@chainlit/react-client`
- `UserIcon` component from `assets/user`
- Material-UI components: `Avatar`, `IconButton`

### UserAvatar
#### Description
A functional component that renders a user's avatar or a default user icon within an `IconButton`.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| props | IconButtonProps | Props to be spread onto the `IconButton` component |

#### Outputs
Returns a JSX element representing the user avatar button.

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves user information using the `useAuth` hook.
2. Determines the display name from user data.
3. Renders an `IconButton` containing an `Avatar`.
4. If a user is authenticated:
   - Displays the user's profile image if available.
   - Falls back to the first letter of the display name (uppercase) if no image is set.
5. If no user is authenticated, displays a generic `UserIcon`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @mui/material | Provides UI components (Avatar, IconButton) |
| @chainlit/react-client | Provides authentication hook (useAuth) |
| assets/user | Provides the UserIcon component |

## Performance Considerations
The component uses the `useAuth` hook, which may trigger re-renders when the authentication state changes. This is generally efficient but could potentially impact performance in scenarios with frequent auth state changes.
