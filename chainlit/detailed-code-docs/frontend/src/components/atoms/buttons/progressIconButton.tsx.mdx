## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `CircularProgressIconButton` that combines an IconButton with a circular progress indicator. It's designed to show progress for an action associated with the button, such as file upload or processing.

## Symbols

### CircularProgressIconButton
#### Description
A custom React component that renders an IconButton with an optional circular progress indicator overlaid on top of it. The progress indicator is shown only when the progress is less than 100%.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| progress | number | The current progress value (0-100) |
| children | React.ReactNode | The content to be rendered inside the IconButton |
| ...iconButtonProps | IconButtonProps | Additional props to be passed to the IconButton component |

#### Outputs
This component renders a JSX element.

#### Internal Logic
1. The component renders a container `div` with relative positioning and inline-flex display.
2. Inside the container, it renders an IconButton with the provided children and additional props.
3. If the progress is less than 100, it renders a CircularProgress component positioned absolutely over the IconButton.
4. The CircularProgress is set to "determinate" variant, allowing it to show the current progress.
5. The progress indicator is styled to be non-interactive (pointer-events: 'none') to prevent it from interfering with button clicks.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @mui/material/CircularProgress | Provides the circular progress indicator component |
| @mui/material/IconButton | Provides the base IconButton component |

## References
This component is used in the `Attachments` component (frontend/src/components/molecules/attachments.tsx) to show upload progress for attachments and provide a cancel option.

## Performance Considerations
The component uses inline styles for positioning, which is generally fine for small-scale usage. However, for applications with many instances of this component, consider moving styles to a separate CSS file or using styled-components for better performance.
