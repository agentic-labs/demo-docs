## High-level description
This directory contains components related to button elements in the frontend of the application. It includes various custom button implementations that extend or wrap Material-UI (MUI) components to provide consistent styling and functionality across the application. The buttons are designed to adapt to the current theme (light or dark mode) and offer different visual styles for different purposes.

## What does it do?
The components in this directory provide a set of reusable button elements that can be used throughout the application for various purposes:

1. `AccentButton`: A button with accent styling, adapting to the current theme.
2. `GreyButton`: A grey-colored button that adjusts its appearance based on the theme.
3. `RegularButton`: A standard button with consistent styling across the application.
4. `Toggle`: A custom toggle component for switching between multiple options.
5. `GithubButton`: A button linking to a GitHub repository, conditionally rendered based on configuration.
6. `CircularProgressIconButton`: An icon button with an integrated circular progress indicator.
7. `ScrollDownButton`: A styled button with a downward chevron icon, typically used for scrolling.
8. `UserButton`: A complex button component for user-related actions, including an avatar and dropdown menu.

These buttons provide a consistent look and feel across the application while offering specific functionality for different use cases.

## Key Files
1. `AccentButton.tsx`: Implements a button with accent styling.
2. `GreyButton.tsx`: Creates a grey-colored button adaptable to the current theme.
3. `RegularButton.tsx`: Defines a standard button with consistent styling.
4. `Toggle.tsx`: Implements a custom toggle component for multiple options.
5. `githubButton.tsx`: Creates a button linking to a GitHub repository.
6. `progressIconButton.tsx`: Implements an icon button with an integrated progress indicator.
7. `scrollDownButton.tsx`: Defines a styled button for scrolling down.
8. `userButton/`: A subdirectory containing components for the user button functionality.
9. `index.ts`: Exports the various button components for easy import in other parts of the application.

## Dependencies
The components in this directory rely on several external libraries and internal modules:

1. React: Core library for building the components
2. Material-UI (@mui/material): Provides base UI components and theming utilities
3. Recoil: Used for state management in some components
4. @chainlit/react-client: Custom library providing hooks for authentication and configuration
5. react-router-dom: Used for navigation in some components

## Configuration
Some components use configuration options to determine their behavior:

- `GithubButton` uses the application configuration to determine whether to render based on the presence of a GitHub URL.
- `UserButton` components use configuration to determine the display of certain menu items.

The components are designed to work with the application's theming system, adapting their appearance based on whether the application is in light or dark mode.

These button components form a crucial part of the application's UI toolkit, providing consistent and customizable interaction elements across different parts of the frontend. They encapsulate common styling and behavior patterns, making it easier for developers to create a cohesive user interface while allowing for specific customizations when needed.
