## Symbols

### ScrollDownButton
#### Description
`ScrollDownButton` is a functional React component that creates a styled button with a downward-pointing chevron icon. It's designed to be positioned absolutely within its parent container and is typically used to prompt users to scroll down a page or container.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| onClick | () =&gt; void | Optional callback function to be executed when the button is clicked |

#### Outputs
The component returns a JSX element representing the styled IconButton.

#### Internal Logic
1. The component uses Material-UI's `IconButton` as its base.
2. It applies custom styling using the `sx` prop to position and style the button.
3. The `ChevronDownIcon` is used as the button's content.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @mui/material | Provides the IconButton component |
| assets/chevronDown | Custom icon component for the chevron down icon |

## References
- The `ChevronDownIcon` component is imported from 'assets/chevronDown'.
- The `IconButton` component is used from Material-UI.

## Code Structure
The `ScrollDownButton` component is the main and only symbol in this file. It uses the `IconButton` from Material-UI and the custom `ChevronDownIcon` to create a styled button component.

## Side Effects
This component does not have any side effects. It's a pure presentational component that renders based on its props.

## Performance Considerations
The component is relatively simple and should not have significant performance implications. However, it's worth noting that the extensive use of the `sx` prop for styling might have a slight impact on render performance compared to using pre-defined styles.
