## High-level description
The `AccentButton` component is a custom button implementation that extends the Material-UI Button component. It provides a consistent accent button style across the application, adapting to the current theme (light or dark mode) and allowing for additional customization through props.

### AccentButton
#### Description
`AccentButton` is a functional component that wraps the Material-UI Button component with custom styling. It uses the current theme to determine the button's color and applies a text color to its parent span element.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| children | React.ReactNode | The content to be rendered inside the button |
| props | ButtonProps & { target?: string } | Additional props for the Button component, including an optional 'target' prop |

#### Internal Logic
1. The component uses the `useTheme` hook to access the current theme.
2. It wraps the Material-UI Button in a span element with a text color matching the theme's primary text color.
3. The Button's color is set to 'inherit' for dark mode and 'primary' for light mode.
4. All other props are spread onto the Button component, allowing for further customization.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @mui/material/Button | Provides the base Button component |
| @mui/material/styles | Provides the useTheme hook for accessing the current theme |

## References
The `AccentButton` component is used in various parts of the application, including:
- `NewChatDialog` component
- `FeedbackButtons` component
- `UserMessage` component
- `ChatSettingsModal` component

These usages demonstrate that the `AccentButton` is a core UI element used for important actions throughout the application.

## Performance Considerations
The `AccentButton` component uses the `useTheme` hook, which may cause re-renders when the theme changes. However, this is generally not a performance concern unless the theme is changing frequently or there are a large number of `AccentButton` instances rendered simultaneously.
