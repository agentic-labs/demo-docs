## High-level description
The `Toggle` component is a customizable, styled toggle button implemented using Material-UI (MUI) components. It allows users to switch between multiple options, displaying them as tabs with a sliding indicator for the selected item. The component is designed to work with both light and dark themes and integrates with the application's input handling system.

## Code Structure
The `Toggle` component is defined as a functional React component that uses various MUI components (Box, Tab, Tabs) and custom hooks (useIsDarkMode) to create a styled toggle button. It also utilizes the `InputStateHandler` component for consistent input handling across the application.

### Toggle
#### Description
The `Toggle` component creates a customized toggle button using MUI components. It allows users to switch between multiple options presented as tabs.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | string | Unique identifier for the toggle |
| items | string[] | Array of options to display in the toggle |
| label | string | (Optional) Label for the toggle |
| onChange | function | Callback function to handle value changes |
| value | string | Currently selected value |
| disabled | boolean | (Optional) Whether the toggle is disabled |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSX.Element | React component | Rendered Toggle component |

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses the `useIsDarkMode` hook to determine the current theme mode.
2. Wraps the toggle in an `InputStateHandler` for consistent input handling.
3. Creates a `Box` component with custom styling for the toggle container.
4. Implements a `Tabs` component with custom styling for the toggle functionality.
5. Maps through the `items` array to create individual `Tab` components for each option.
6. Handles the `onChange` event to update the selected value.

## Side Effects
The component uses the `useIsDarkMode` hook, which may cause re-renders when the theme mode changes.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @mui/material | Provides UI components (Box, Tab, Tabs) |
| react | Core React library |

## Performance Considerations
The component uses `findIndex` to determine the current tab index, which has a time complexity of O(n). For a large number of items, this could potentially impact performance.

## Error Handling
The component doesn't implement specific error handling mechanisms. It relies on React's default error boundaries and the error handling provided by the `InputStateHandler` component.

## Styling
The component uses MUI's `sx` prop for custom styling, including:
- Custom border and background color for the toggle container
- Custom styling for the tabs, including text transformation, colors, and dimensions
- A sliding indicator for the selected tab, with different colors for light and dark modes

The styling is responsive to the current theme mode (light/dark) and uses predefined color palettes from the theme.
