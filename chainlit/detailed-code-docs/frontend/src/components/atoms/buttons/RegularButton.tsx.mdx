### RegularButton
#### Description
`RegularButton` is a functional component that wraps the Material-UI Button component with custom styling. It applies specific color and background styles based on the current theme mode.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| children | React.ReactNode | The content to be displayed inside the button |
| props | Props | Additional props to be passed to the underlying Button component |

#### Outputs
The component returns a styled Button wrapped in a `&lt;span&gt;` element.

#### Internal Logic
1. The component uses the Material-UI `Button` component as its base.
2. It applies custom styling using the `sx` prop:
   - Removes text transformation
   - Sets the text color based on the theme mode
   - Sets the background color based on the theme mode
   - Defines hover behavior for the background color
3. All other props are spread onto the `Button` component.
4. The button is wrapped in a `&lt;span&gt;` element for consistent rendering.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @mui/material/Button | Provides the base Button component |
| theme/palette | Imports the `grey` color palette |

## References
The `RegularButton` component is used in various parts of the application, including:
- `NewChatDialog` component
- `UserMessage` component
- `ChatSettingsModal` component

These usages demonstrate that `RegularButton` is a common component used for standard button actions throughout the application.

## Performance Considerations
The component uses theme-based styling, which allows for efficient theme switching without re-rendering. However, the use of arrow functions in the `sx` prop might create new function instances on each render, potentially affecting performance in high-frequency re-render scenarios.

## Notes
- The component extends the `ButtonProps` interface from Material-UI, allowing it to accept all standard Button props.
- The `component` and `to` props in the `Props` interface suggest that this button might be used with routing libraries, although this functionality is not directly implemented in the provided code.
- The use of a `&lt;span&gt;` wrapper around the Button might affect styling or layout in certain scenarios and should be considered when using this component.
