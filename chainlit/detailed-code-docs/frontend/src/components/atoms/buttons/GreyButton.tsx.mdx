## High-level description
The `GreyButton` component is a custom button implementation that extends the Material-UI Button component. It provides a grey-colored button that adapts its appearance based on the current theme (light or dark mode). The component ensures consistent styling across the application while allowing for theme-specific adjustments.

## Code Structure
The `GreyButton` component is defined as a functional component that wraps the Material-UI Button component. It utilizes theme-related utilities and components from Material-UI to apply the appropriate grey theme based on the current application theme.

## References
- `darkGreyButtonTheme` and `lightGreyButtonTheme` from 'theme/theme'
- `Button`, `ThemeProvider`, and `useTheme` from Material-UI

### GreyButton
#### Description
A functional component that renders a grey-colored button using Material-UI's Button component. It applies a specific grey theme based on the current application theme (dark or light mode).

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| sx | object | Custom styles to be applied to the button |
| ...props | ButtonProps | Other props to be passed to the Material-UI Button component |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| - | React.ReactElement | A themed Button component |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the current theme using `useTheme` hook.
2. Determines the appropriate grey theme based on the current theme mode.
3. Wraps the Button component with a ThemeProvider to apply the grey theme.
4. Applies additional styling and props to the Button component.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @mui/material | Provides Button, ThemeProvider, and useTheme components/hooks |
| theme/theme | Provides darkGreyButtonTheme and lightGreyButtonTheme |

## Configuration
The component uses the following configuration from the theme:
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| palette.mode | string | - | Determines whether to use dark or light grey theme |

## Performance Considerations
The component uses `useTheme` hook, which may cause re-renders if the theme changes. However, this is necessary for proper theme switching functionality.

## Additional Notes
1. The component disables elevation and ripple effect on the button.
2. It sets `textTransform` to 'none' to prevent automatic text transformation.
3. The component allows for additional styling through the `sx` prop, which is merged with the default styles.
4. The grey theme (dark or light) is applied using a separate ThemeProvider, which overrides the default theme for this specific component.

This component is part of a larger set of custom button components, as evidenced by the related `RegularButton` component and the exports in the `index.ts` file. It provides a consistent way to create grey buttons across the application while respecting the current theme mode.
