## High-level description
The `InlinedPDFList` component is a React functional component that renders a list of PDF elements inline. It takes an array of PDF elements as input and displays them vertically using Material-UI's Stack component, with each PDF element wrapped in a div with specific styling.

## Code Structure
The component imports necessary dependencies, defines the `Props` interface, and exports the `InlinedPDFList` component. It uses the `PDFElement` component to render individual PDF elements.

## References
- `IPdfElement` from 'client-types/'
- `PDFElement` from './PDF'

### `InlinedPDFList`
#### Description
A functional component that renders a list of PDF elements inline.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| items | IPdfElement[] | An array of PDF elements to be displayed |

#### Outputs
Returns a React component that renders the list of PDF elements.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses Material-UI's `Stack` component to create a vertical layout with spacing.
2. Maps through the `items` array, rendering each PDF element inside a div.
3. Each div has a fixed maximum width of 600px and height of 400px.
4. Uses the `PDFElement` component to render individual PDF elements.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @mui/material/Stack | Used for creating a vertical stack layout |
| client-types/ | Provides the `IPdfElement` type definition |
| ./PDF | Imports the `PDFElement` component for rendering individual PDFs |

## Additional Notes
1. The component uses the index `i` as the key for each rendered div. While this works, it's generally recommended to use a more stable unique identifier if available.
2. The fixed dimensions (600px width, 400px height) for each PDF container might not be ideal for all use cases and could potentially be made configurable.
3. The component doesn't handle empty `items` array explicitly, but it will render an empty Stack if no items are provided.

This component is part of a larger system for rendering various types of elements, as evidenced by the related files. It's specifically used in the `InlinedElements` component when PDF elements are present in the message elements.
