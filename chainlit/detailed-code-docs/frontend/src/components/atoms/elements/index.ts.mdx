## High-level description
This file serves as an index for various element components used in the frontend of the application. It exports both individual element components and inlined list components for different types of elements such as audio, video, image, text, and more.

## Code Structure
The file consists of two main sections:
1. Exports of individual element components
2. Exports of inlined list components for each element type

## Symbols

### Individual Element Exports
#### Description
These exports make individual element components available for use in other parts of the application.

#### Exports
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| AudioElement | Component | Renders an audio element |
| Element | Component | Generic element renderer |
| ElementSideView | Component | Renders an element in a side view |
| ElementView | Component | Renders an element view |
| FileElement | Component | Renders a file element |
| FrameElement | Component | Renders a frame element |

| PDFElement | Component | Renders a PDF element |
| PlotlyElement | Component | Renders a Plotly chart element |
| TextElement | Component | Renders a text element |
| VideoElement | Component | Renders a video element |

### Inlined List Exports
#### Description
These exports make inlined list components available for rendering multiple elements of the same type.

#### Exports
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| InlinedAudioList | Component | Renders a list of audio elements |
| InlinedElements | Component | Renders a list of generic elements |
| InlinedFileList | Component | Renders a list of file elements |
| InlinedImageList | Component | Renders a list of image elements |
| InlinedPDFList | Component | Renders a list of PDF elements |

## Dependencies
This file doesn't directly import any external libraries, but it relies on the components it exports, which in turn have their own dependencies.

## Notes
- The file acts as a central point for exporting various element-related components, making it easier to import and use these components throughout the application.
- The separation between individual elements and inlined lists allows for flexible usage depending on whether a single element or multiple elements of the same type need to be rendered.
- The naming convention used (e.g., `AudioElement`, `InlinedAudioList`) makes it clear what each exported component represents and how it should be used.
