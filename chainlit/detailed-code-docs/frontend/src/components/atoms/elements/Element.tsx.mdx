## High-level description
The `Element` component in `frontend/src/components/atoms/elements/Element.tsx` is a React component that renders different types of elements based on the `type` property of the input `element`. It serves as a central hub for rendering various element types such as files, images, text, PDFs, audio, video, and Plotly charts.

## Code Structure
The `Element` component imports specific element components for each type and uses a switch statement to render the appropriate component based on the `element.type`. If no matching type is found, it returns null.

## Symbols

### Element
#### Description
A functional React component that renders different types of elements based on the `type` property of the input `element`.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| element | IMessageElement (optional) | The element object containing type and other properties |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSX.Element or null | React element | The rendered element component or null if no matching type |

#### Internal Logic
1. The component uses a switch statement to check the `element.type`.
2. Based on the type, it renders the corresponding element component (e.g., FileElement, ImageElement, etc.).
3. If no matching type is found or if `element` is undefined, it returns null.

## References
- IMessageElement (imported from 'client-types/')
- Various element components (AudioElement, FileElement, ImageElement, PDFElement, PlotlyElement, TextElement, VideoElement)

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| React | Core library for building the component |
| client-types | Provides the IMessageElement type definition |

## Related Components
The `Element` component is used in conjunction with several other components:
- AudioElement
- FileElement
- ImageElement
- PDFElement
- PlotlyElement
- TextElement
- VideoElement

Each of these components is responsible for rendering a specific type of element and is imported at the top of the file.

The `Element` component is likely used in higher-level components to render various types of content dynamically based on the data received from the server or application state.
