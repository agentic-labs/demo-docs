## High-level description
The `VideoElement` component is a React functional component that renders a video player using the `ReactPlayer` library. It takes an `IVideoElement` object as a prop and displays the video if a URL is provided, with customizable configuration options.

## Symbols

### VideoElement
#### Description
This functional component renders a video player using the `ReactPlayer` component from the `react-player` library. It accepts an `IVideoElement` object as its prop and configures the player based on the provided element properties.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| element | IVideoElement | An object containing video element properties, including the URL and display settings |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSX.Element or null | React component | Returns a ReactPlayer component if a URL is provided, otherwise returns null |

#### Internal Logic
1. The component first checks if the `element.url` exists. If not, it returns `null`, effectively rendering nothing.
2. If a URL is present, it renders a `ReactPlayer` component with the following properties:
   - `className`: Set to `${element.display}-video`, which likely determines the styling based on the display type.
   - `width`: Set to "100%" to occupy the full width of its container.
   - `controls`: Set to `true` to display video controls.
   - `url`: Set to the provided `element.url`.
   - `config`: Set to `element.playerConfig` if provided, otherwise an empty object. This allows for custom player configurations.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ReactPlayer | External library used to render the video player |
| IVideoElement | Type import from 'client-types/' for type checking |

## References
The `VideoElement` component is used in other parts of the application, as seen in the related code snippets:

1. In `InlinedVideoList.tsx`, it's used to render individual video elements within a list.
2. In `Element.tsx`, it's used as part of a switch statement to render video elements based on the element type.

## Notes
- The component uses TypeScript for type checking, ensuring that the `element` prop conforms to the `IVideoElement` interface.
- The `IVideoElement` interface (from the related code snippets) extends a `TMessageElement` type with a 'video' type and includes optional `size` and `playerConfig` properties.
- The component is flexible in its display, using the `element.display` property to set the className, which can be used for styling purposes.
- The use of `ReactPlayer` allows for a wide range of video sources to be played, as it supports various video platforms and file types.
