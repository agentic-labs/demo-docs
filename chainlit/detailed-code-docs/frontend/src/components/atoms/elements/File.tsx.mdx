### FileElement
#### Description
A functional React component that renders a downloadable file link with an icon and filename.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| element | IFileElement | An object containing file information such as URL, name, display type, and MIME type |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSX.Element or null | React element | A Link component wrapping an Attachment component, or null if no URL is provided |

#### Internal Logic
1. Check if the `element.url` exists. If not, return null.
2. Render a `Link` component with the following properties:
   - `className`: Based on the `element.display` property
   - `download`: Set to the file name
   - `href`: Set to the file URL
   - `target`: Set to "_blank" to open in a new tab
   - `sx`: Removes text decoration
3. Inside the `Link`, render an `Attachment` component with the file name and MIME type.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @mui/material | Provides the Link component for creating the downloadable link |
| components/atoms/Attachment | Custom component for rendering file information and icon |
| client-types/ | Provides the IFileElement interface type |
