## High-level description
The `ElementView` component is a React functional component that renders a view for displaying a single message element. It provides a layout with a back button (if applicable) and the element's name as a header, followed by the actual element content.

## Code Structure
The `ElementView` component imports necessary UI components from Material-UI and uses a custom hook `useLayoutMaxWidth`. It takes `element` and `onGoBack` as props and renders a structured view of the element.

## References
- `useLayoutMaxWidth` hook from 'hooks/useLayoutMaxWidth'
- `IMessageElement` type from 'client-types/'
- `Element` component (imported from the same file)

### ElementView
#### Description
A React functional component that renders a view for a single message element.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| element | IMessageElement | The message element to be displayed |
| onGoBack | () =&gt; void | Optional callback function for the back button |

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses the `useLayoutMaxWidth` hook to determine the maximum width for the layout.
2. Renders a `Box` component as the main container with specific styling.
3. Renders a `Stack` component for the header, which includes:
   - An optional back button (IconButton with ArrowBack icon) if `onGoBack` is provided.
   - The element's name as a Typography component.
4. Renders the `Element` component, passing the `element` prop.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @mui/icons-material | For the ArrowBack icon |
| @mui/material | For various UI components (Box, IconButton, Stack, Typography) |
| hooks/useLayoutMaxWidth | Custom hook for determining layout max width |
| client-types/ | For the IMessageElement type |

## Performance Considerations
The component uses `useLayoutMaxWidth` hook, which might cause a re-render if the layout width changes. This should be considered for performance in responsive designs.

## Exports
The file exports both `ElementView` and `Element` components, making them available for use in other parts of the application.
