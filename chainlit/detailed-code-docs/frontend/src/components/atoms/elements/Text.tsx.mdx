## High-level description
The `TextElement` component is a React component that renders text content, potentially fetched from a URL, with support for Markdown formatting, LaTeX rendering, and syntax highlighting. It's designed to display various types of text-based content within the Chainlit application.

## Code Structure
The `TextElement` component is the main export of this file. It uses several hooks and components to fetch data, apply configuration settings, and render the content using Markdown.

## References
- `ITextElement` from '@chainlit/react-client'
- `useConfig` from '@chainlit/react-client'
- `Markdown` from 'components/molecules/Markdown'
- `useFetch` from 'hooks/useFetch'

## Symbols

### TextElement
#### Description
A functional component that renders text content, potentially fetched from a URL, with support for Markdown, LaTeX, and syntax highlighting.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| element | ITextElement | The text element object containing properties like URL and language |

#### Internal Logic
1. Fetches data from the URL if provided using the `useFetch` hook
2. Determines the content to display based on loading state, error, or fetched data
3. Applies syntax highlighting if a language is specified
4. Renders the content using the `Markdown` component with configuration options

#### Performance Considerations
The component uses the `useFetch` hook, which likely implements caching to optimize repeated requests for the same URL.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @mui/material | UI components (Box) |
| @chainlit/react-client | Type definitions and configuration hook |
| components/molecules/Markdown | Markdown rendering component |
| hooks/useFetch | Custom hook for data fetching |

## Configuration
The component uses the following configuration options:
| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| features.unsafe_allow_html | boolean | Allows HTML rendering in Markdown |
| features.latex | boolean | Enables LaTeX rendering in Markdown |

These options are obtained from the `useConfig` hook.

## Error Handling
The component handles errors from the `useFetch` hook by displaying an "An error occured" message.

## API/Interface Reference
The `TextElement` component expects a prop of type `ITextElement`, which likely includes the following properties:
| Property | Type | Description |
|:---------|:-----|:------------|
| url | string | (Optional) URL to fetch content from |
| language | string | (Optional) Language for syntax highlighting |
