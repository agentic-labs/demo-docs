## High-level description
The `InlinedPlotlyList` component is a React functional component that renders a list of Plotly elements in a vertical stack. It takes an array of `IPlotlyElement` objects as input and displays each element using the `PlotlyElement` component, with consistent sizing and spacing.

## Symbols

### `InlinedPlotlyList`
#### Description
This is the main functional component that renders a list of Plotly elements.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| items | IPlotlyElement[] | An array of Plotly element objects to be rendered |

#### Internal Logic
1. The component uses Material-UI's `Stack` component to create a vertical layout with spacing between elements.
2. It maps through the `items` array, rendering each `PlotlyElement` inside a `div` with specific styling.
3. Each `PlotlyElement` is given a maximum width of 600px and a height of 400px.
4. The `key` prop for each mapped element uses the index `i` as a unique identifier.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @mui/material/Stack | Used for creating a vertical stack layout |
| client-types/ | Imports the `IPlotlyElement` type |
| ./Plotly | Imports the `PlotlyElement` component |

## References
- The `PlotlyElement` component is imported from './Plotly' and is used to render individual Plotly elements.
- The `IPlotlyElement` type is imported from 'client-types/' and is used to define the shape of the items in the input array.

## Code Structure
The `InlinedPlotlyList` component is part of a larger system of inlined elements, as evidenced by the related `InlinedElements.tsx` file. It specifically handles the rendering of Plotly elements in a list format, while other components handle different element types (e.g., images, text, PDFs).

The `Plotly.tsx` file contains the implementation of the `PlotlyElement` component, which is responsible for fetching and rendering individual Plotly charts.

## Performance Considerations
The use of `key={i}` in the mapped elements might lead to potential issues with React's reconciliation process if the order of elements changes. Consider using a more stable unique identifier if available in the `IPlotlyElement` objects.
