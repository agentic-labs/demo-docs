## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `PlotlyElement` that renders a Plotly chart. It uses lazy loading and error boundary to handle potential issues during rendering. The component fetches data from a URL and displays a loading state while data is being fetched.

## Code Structure
The main component `PlotlyElement` wraps an internal component `_PlotlyElement` with an `ErrorBoundary`. The `_PlotlyElement` component handles data fetching, loading states, and rendering of the Plotly chart.

## Symbols

### `PlotlyElement`
#### Description
This is the main exported component that wraps `_PlotlyElement` with an `ErrorBoundary`.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| props | Props | Contains the `element` prop of type `IPlotlyElement` |

#### Internal Logic
Wraps `_PlotlyElement` with an `ErrorBoundary` to handle potential errors during rendering.

### `_PlotlyElement`
#### Description
This internal component handles the fetching of data and rendering of the Plotly chart.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| element | IPlotlyElement | Contains information about the Plotly element, including the URL to fetch data from |

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses `useFetch` hook to fetch data from the URL specified in `element.url`.
2. Handles loading and error states.
3. Renders a Plotly chart using the fetched data.

### `Plot`
#### Description
A lazily loaded component from 'react-plotly.js' used to render the Plotly chart.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react | For React components and hooks |
| react-plotly.js | For rendering Plotly charts |
| components/atoms/ErrorBoundary | For error handling |
| hooks/useFetch | For data fetching |
| client-types/ | For type definitions |

## Error Handling
The component uses an `ErrorBoundary` to catch and display errors that may occur during rendering. It also handles errors that may occur during data fetching using the `useFetch` hook.

## Performance Considerations
The component uses lazy loading for the Plotly component, which can help improve initial load times, especially if the Plotly library is large.

## Side Effects
The component fetches data from a URL specified in the `element` prop, which is a side effect that interacts with external resources.

This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the `PlotlyElement` component, its structure, and its functionality. It highlights the main aspects of the code, including error handling, data fetching, and performance considerations.
