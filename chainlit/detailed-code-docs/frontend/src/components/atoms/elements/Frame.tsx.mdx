## High-level description
The `FrameElement` component is a reusable UI element that creates a styled container for its child components. It provides a consistent visual frame with padding, background color, and rounded corners, adapting to the current theme mode (light or dark).

### FrameElement
#### Description
`FrameElement` is a functional component that wraps its children in a styled `Box` component from Material-UI. It applies consistent styling to create a frame-like container.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| children | React.ReactNode | The content to be rendered inside the frame |

#### Outputs
The component returns a styled `Box` component containing the provided children.

#### Internal Logic
The component uses Material-UI's `Box` component with the following styling:
- Padding of 1 unit
- Box sizing set to 'border-box'
- Background color that changes based on the theme mode (light or dark)
- Border radius of 4 pixels
- Flex display

The background color is dynamically set using a function that checks the current theme mode and applies either `grey[200]` for light mode or `grey[900]` for dark mode.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @mui/material/Box | Provides the base component for creating the frame |
| theme/palette | Imports the `grey` color palette used for background color |

## References
The `FrameElement` is used in other components, such as the `ImageElement` in the `Image.tsx` file, where it wraps the image content to provide a consistent frame.

## Side Effects
This component does not have any side effects. It purely renders UI based on the provided props and theme.

## Performance Considerations
The `FrameElement` is a lightweight component that should have minimal performance impact. The dynamic background color calculation based on the theme mode is the only potential performance consideration, but it should not cause significant overhead in most use cases.
