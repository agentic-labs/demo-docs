## High-level description
The `AudioElement` component is a React functional component that renders an audio player with a title. It's designed to display and play audio content within a user interface, with customizable styling based on the current theme.

## Code Structure
The `AudioElement` component is the main and only symbol in this file. It imports necessary dependencies and types, and exports itself for use in other parts of the application.

## References
This component references the `IAudioElement` type from 'client-types/', and uses various Material-UI components and hooks.

## Symbols

### AudioElement
#### Description
`AudioElement` is a functional component that renders an audio player with a title. It uses Material-UI components for styling and layout.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| element | IAudioElement | An object containing audio element properties |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSX.Element or null | React element | Rendered audio player component or null if no URL is provided |

#### Internal Logic
1. The component first checks if the `element.url` exists. If not, it returns `null`.
2. If the URL exists, it renders a `Box` component with a class name based on the `element.display` property.
3. Inside the `Box`, it renders a `Typography` component for the audio title, styled based on the current theme.
4. Finally, it renders an `audio` element with controls, the source URL, and autoplay setting.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @mui/material | Provides UI components (Typography, Box) and theming utilities |
| theme/palette | Imports color palette for styling |
| client-types | Provides the IAudioElement type definition |

## Performance Considerations
The component uses the `useTheme` hook, which may cause re-renders if the theme changes. However, this is generally not a performance concern unless the theme is changing frequently.

## Error Handling
The component handles the case where `element.url` is not provided by returning `null`, effectively not rendering anything. This prevents errors from occurring when trying to render an audio player without a valid source.
