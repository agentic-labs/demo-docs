## High-level description
The `PDFElement` component is a React functional component that renders a PDF document within an iframe. It takes a PDF element as a prop and displays it, optionally specifying a particular page to show. This component is part of a larger system for rendering various types of elements in a user interface.

### PDFElement
#### Description
`PDFElement` is a functional component that renders a PDF document using an iframe. It handles cases where a specific page needs to be displayed and ensures the PDF is properly embedded in the UI.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| element | IPdfElement | An object containing information about the PDF to be displayed, including its URL and optional page number |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSX.Element or null | React element | Returns an iframe element containing the PDF, or null if no URL is provided |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the `element.url` exists. If not, it returns null.
2. Constructs the URL for the iframe source:
   - If `element.page` is specified, it appends `#page={page_number}` to the URL.
   - Otherwise, it uses the original URL.
3. Renders an iframe with the following properties:
   - `className`: Combines the `element.display` value with "-pdf" suffix.
   - `src`: The constructed URL.
   - `style`: Sets the border to 'none'.
   - `width` and `height`: Both set to "100%".

## Dependencies
The component imports the `IPdfElement` type from 'client-types/', which is likely defined in the `libs/react-client/src/types/element.ts` file.

## References
- The `PDFElement` component is used in the `InlinedPDFList` component (`frontend/src/components/atoms/elements/InlinedPDFList.tsx`).
- It's also referenced in the `Element` component (`frontend/src/components/atoms/elements/Element.tsx`) as part of a switch statement for rendering different element types.
- The component is exported in the index file (`frontend/src/components/atoms/elements/index.ts`) for use in other parts of the application.

## Notes
1. The component uses a functional style and TypeScript for type safety.
2. It handles the case where no URL is provided by returning null, preventing rendering errors.
3. The iframe's class name is dynamically set based on the `display` property of the element, allowing for different styling based on how the PDF should be displayed (e.g., inline, side, or page).
4. The component doesn't handle loading states or errors, which might be worth considering for a more robust implementation.
5. The iframe takes up 100% of its container's width and height, so sizing should be managed by the parent component.

This component provides a simple and flexible way to embed PDF documents in a React application, with the ability to specify a starting page and adapt to different display contexts.
