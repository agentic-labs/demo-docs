## High-level description
The `InlinedVideoList` component is a React functional component that renders a list of video elements. It uses the `ListWithSize` component to display the videos in a grid-like layout, with each video rendered using the `VideoElement` component.

## Code Structure
The `InlinedVideoList` component is composed of two main parts: the `ListWithSize` component and the `VideoElement` component. It takes an array of `IVideoElement` items as props and passes them to `ListWithSize` for rendering.

## References
- `IVideoElement` from 'client-types/'
- `ListWithSize` from './ListWithSize'
- `VideoElement` from './Video'

## Symbols

### `InlinedVideoList`
#### Description
A functional component that renders a list of video elements using the `ListWithSize` component.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| items | IVideoElement[] | An array of video elements to be rendered |

#### Internal Logic
The component uses the `ListWithSize` component to render the video elements. It passes the `items` prop to `ListWithSize` as `elements` and provides a render function that creates a `VideoElement` for each item.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| client-types | Provides the `IVideoElement` type definition |
| ListWithSize | Component used for rendering the list of videos with size considerations |
| VideoElement | Component used for rendering individual video elements |

## Additional Context
1. The `InlinedVideoList` component is part of a larger system for rendering various types of elements, as seen in the `InlinedElements` component.
2. The `ListWithSize` component is generic and can handle both `IImageElement` and `IVideoElement` types. It creates a grid-like layout using Material-UI's `ImageList` and `ImageListItem` components.
3. The `VideoElement` component uses the `ReactPlayer` library to render video elements, supporting various video sources and configurations.
4. The `IVideoElement` interface extends from `TMessageElement&lt;'video'&gt;` and includes properties like `size` and `playerConfig` for customizing the video display.

This component plays a crucial role in the application's ability to display lists of video content in a flexible and visually appealing manner.
