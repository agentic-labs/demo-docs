## High-level description
The `ElementSideView` component is a resizable drawer that displays additional content related to the main view. It's designed to show detailed information about a selected element in a side panel, which can be resized by the user.

## Code Structure
The main `ElementSideView` component uses several sub-components and hooks to manage its state and appearance. It relies on the `sideViewState` from Recoil for global state management and uses Material-UI components for styling.

## Symbols

### `Handle`
#### Description
A custom handle component used for resizing the drawer.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| handleAxis | string | (optional) The axis of the handle |

#### Internal Logic
- Renders a small box that acts as a resize handle for the drawer
- Positioned absolutely on the left side of the drawer
- Styled to be visually distinct and indicate its function

### `ElementSideView`
#### Description
The main component that renders a resizable side drawer to display element details.

#### Internal Logic
1. Manages the drawer's width state and resize functionality
2. Handles responsiveness for small screens
3. Renders the drawer content, including a title and close button
4. Displays the selected element's content using the `Element` component

#### Side Effects
- Updates the global `sideViewState` when the drawer is closed

### `Drawer`
#### Description
A styled Material-UI Drawer component with custom props for responsive design.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| open | boolean | Whether the drawer is open |
| width | number \| string | The width of the drawer |
| isSmallScreen | boolean | Whether the screen is small |

#### Internal Logic
- Applies custom styling based on the screen size and open state
- Handles the positioning and appearance of the drawer

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react | Core React library |
| react-resizable | Provides resizing functionality |
| recoil | State management |
| usehooks-ts | Custom React hooks |
| @mui/material | UI components and styling |
| @chainlit/react-client | Custom state management for the application |

## Performance Considerations
The component uses `useState` for local state management of the drawer width and resize status. It also leverages `useRecoilState` for global state management of the side view element. The resizing functionality might impact performance on slower devices, especially during the resize operation.

## Error Handling
There's no explicit error handling in this component. It relies on the default error boundaries provided by React.

## API/Interface Reference
This component doesn't expose a public API but interacts with the global state through the `sideViewState` Recoil atom.
