## High-level description
This code defines a custom `Link` component that combines the functionality of React Router's `Link` and Material-UI's `Link` components. It provides a unified interface for creating links that work with both routing and styling systems.

## Code Structure
The code imports necessary components from React, React Router, and Material-UI, then defines a custom `Link` component that wraps these imported components.

## Symbols

### Link
#### Description
A custom React component that combines the properties of React Router's `Link` and Material-UI's `Link` components. It renders a Material-UI Link component that uses React Router's Link as its underlying component.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| children | React.ReactNode | The content to be rendered inside the link |
| ...rest | RRLinkProps & MLinkProps | Spread of properties from both React Router's Link and Material-UI's Link |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSX.Element | JSX.Element | A rendered link component |

#### Internal Logic
1. The component takes `children` and `...rest` as props.
2. It renders a Material-UI `Link` component (`MLink`).
3. The `component` prop of `MLink` is set to React Router's `Link` component (`RRLink`).
4. All other props are spread onto the `MLink` component.
5. The `children` are rendered inside the `MLink` component.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react | Core React library |
| react-router-dom | Provides routing capabilities |
| @mui/material | Provides Material-UI components |

## References
This component is likely used throughout the application wherever links need to be created, especially in navigation components or for internal routing. For example, it's used in the `UserMenu` component (from the related code snippets) in the API Keys menu item:

```typescript
&lt;MenuItem key="env" component={Link} to="/env"&gt;
  {/* ... */}
&lt;/MenuItem&gt;
```

This usage demonstrates how the custom `Link` component seamlessly integrates with both Material-UI's component system and React Router's routing capabilities.
