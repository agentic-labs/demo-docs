## High-level description
The `Collapse` component is a reusable React component that provides a collapsible content area with an expand/collapse toggle functionality. It allows for content to be initially displayed in a truncated form and then expanded to show the full content when the user interacts with it.

## Code Structure
The main `Collapse` component uses various Material-UI components and custom icons to create its structure. It utilizes the `useToggle` hook from `usehooks-ts` to manage the expand/collapse state.

## Symbols

### `Collapse`
#### Description
A functional component that renders a collapsible content area with an expand/collapse toggle button.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| children | React.ReactNode | The content to be displayed within the collapsible area |
| defaultExpandAll | boolean | Optional. Determines if the content should be expanded by default. Defaults to `false` |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSX.Element | React component | The rendered Collapse component |

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses `useToggle` hook to manage the expand/collapse state.
2. Renders the content in a `Box` component with conditional styling based on the `expandAll` state.
3. Applies a gradient overlay when the content is collapsed.
4. Uses Material-UI's `Collapse` component to animate the expand/collapse transition.
5. Renders an expand/collapse toggle button with appropriate icon and tooltip.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| usehooks-ts | Provides the `useToggle` hook for state management |
| @mui/material | Provides various UI components (Box, Collapse, IconButton, Stack, Tooltip) |
| assets/chevronDown | Custom icon component for the collapse state |
| assets/chevronUp | Custom icon component for the expand state |

## References
- The `ChevronDownIcon` and `ChevronUpIcon` components are imported from separate files in the `assets` directory.
- This component is used in the `MessageContent` component (from the related code snippets) to wrap long content.

## Performance Considerations
The component uses `MCollapse` from Material-UI with a `timeout={0}`, which disables the animation. This can improve performance for frequent toggling or when dealing with large content.
