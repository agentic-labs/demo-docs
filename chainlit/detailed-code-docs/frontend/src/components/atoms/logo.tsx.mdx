## High-level description
The `Logo` component is a React functional component that renders an image logo. It dynamically fetches the logo URL based on the current theme (light or dark) using the Chainlit API client.

## Code Structure
The `Logo` component uses React hooks and Recoil state management to access the current theme and the Chainlit API client. It then renders an `img` element with the appropriate logo URL.

## References
- `settingsState` from 'state/settings'
- `ChainlitContext` from 'client-types/*'

## Symbols

### Logo
#### Description
A functional component that renders the application logo as an image, adapting to the current theme.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| style | React.CSSProperties | Optional. Custom styles to apply to the logo image. |

#### Outputs
Returns a React element (an `img` tag) representing the logo.

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the current theme from the Recoil `settingsState`.
2. Accesses the Chainlit API client from the `ChainlitContext`.
3. Uses the API client's `getLogoEndpoint` method to get the appropriate logo URL for the current theme.
4. Renders an `img` element with the logo URL and applied styles.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react | For using React hooks (useContext) |
| recoil | For accessing global state (useRecoilValue) |

## Performance Considerations
The component uses `useRecoilValue` and `useContext`, which may cause re-renders when the theme or API client changes. However, these are likely infrequent events, so the performance impact should be minimal.

## Notes
1. The `width` prop is defined in the `Props` interface but not used in the component. It could be removed or utilized if needed.
2. The component assumes that the Chainlit API client has a `getLogoEndpoint` method that takes the theme as an argument.
3. The logo adapts to the current theme (light or dark), providing a consistent user experience across theme changes.
