## High-level description
The `ErrorBoundary` component is a React class component that catches JavaScript errors anywhere in its child component tree, logs those errors, and displays a fallback UI instead of the component tree that crashed. This is particularly useful for gracefully handling runtime errors in React applications.

## Code Structure
The `ErrorBoundary` class extends React's `Component` class and implements the error boundary lifecycle methods. It manages its own state to track whether an error has occurred and what the error message is.

### ErrorBoundary
#### Description
A class component that acts as an error boundary in React applications. It catches errors in its child components, prevents the app from crashing, and displays a fallback error message.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| prefix | string (optional) | A prefix to add to the error message |
| children | ReactNode (optional) | Child components to be rendered inside the ErrorBoundary |

#### Outputs
Renders either the children components if no error occurred, or an error message using Material-UI's Alert component if an error was caught.

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes state with `hasError: false` and `error: undefined`.
2. Implements `getDerivedStateFromError` static method to update state when an error occurs.
3. Implements `componentDidCatch` to log the error to the console.
4. In the `render` method:
   - If an error occurred, displays an error message using Material-UI's Alert component.
   - If no error, renders the children components.

## Side Effects
- Logs errors to the console in the `componentDidCatch` method.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react | Core React library |
| @mui/material | Material-UI components (Alert and Box) |

## Error Handling
This component is specifically designed for error handling. It catches errors in its child components and displays a user-friendly error message instead of crashing the application.

## API/Interface Reference
| Method | Description |
|:-------|:------------|
| getDerivedStateFromError | Static method that updates the component's state when an error occurs |
| componentDidCatch | Lifecycle method that logs the error to the console |
| render | Renders either the children or an error message based on the error state |

This `ErrorBoundary` component provides a robust way to handle errors in React applications, preventing crashes and providing a better user experience when unexpected errors occur.
