### Okta
#### Description
The `Okta` component is a functional React component that returns an SVG element representing the Okta logo.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props.

#### Outputs
Returns a JSX element containing an SVG representation of the Okta logo.

#### Internal Logic
The component renders an SVG element with the following characteristics:
- Version: 1.2
- Namespace: "http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
- Viewbox: "0 0 1594 1595"
- Width and Height: 24 pixels
- Style: The fill color is set to 'inherit', allowing the parent component to control the icon's color

The SVG contains a single `path` element with a complex `d` attribute that defines the shape of the Okta logo. The `fillRule` is set to "evenodd" to determine how the shape is filled.

## Dependencies
This component doesn't have any external dependencies. It's a self-contained SVG icon component.

## Usage Context
Based on the related code snippet from `ProviderButton.tsx`, we can infer that this `Okta` component is likely used as part of a set of authentication provider icons. The `ProviderButton` component imports and uses various provider icons, including `Okta`, to render buttons for different authentication methods.

In the `renderProviderIcon` function of `ProviderButton.tsx`, we can see that the `Okta` component is used when the provider is "okta":

```typescript
function renderProviderIcon(provider: string) {
  switch (provider) {
    // ... other cases
    case 'okta':
      return &lt;Okta /&gt;;
    // ... more cases
  }
}
```

This suggests that the `Okta` icon is used in a button that allows users to authenticate using Okta as the identity provider.

## Performance Considerations
As an SVG icon, this component is lightweight and should have minimal impact on performance. The use of SVG allows for crisp rendering at any size without loss of quality.
