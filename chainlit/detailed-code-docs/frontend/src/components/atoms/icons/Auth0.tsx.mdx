## High-level description
This code defines a React component that renders an SVG icon for Auth0, a popular authentication and authorization platform. The component is designed to be used as part of a larger authentication UI, likely in conjunction with other provider icons.

## Symbols

### Auth0
#### Description
The `Auth0` component is a functional React component that returns an SVG element representing the Auth0 logo. The SVG is styled to inherit its fill color from its parent element and is designed to be scalable while maintaining its aspect ratio.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props.

#### Outputs
Returns a JSX element containing an SVG representation of the Auth0 logo.

#### Internal Logic
The component renders an SVG element with the following characteristics:
- Dimensions: 24x24 pixels
- Viewbox: 0 0 256 287
- Preserves aspect ratio
- Inherits fill color from parent
- Contains a single path element that defines the Auth0 logo shape

## References
The `Auth0` component is imported and used in the `ProviderButton` component from the file `frontend/src/components/molecules/auth/ProviderButton.tsx`. It's used as part of the `renderProviderIcon` function to display the Auth0 icon when the provider is "auth0".

## Dependencies
This component doesn't have any external dependencies. It's a pure SVG implementation using React.

## Performance Considerations
As this is a simple SVG component, it should have minimal performance impact. The SVG is inline, which means it doesn't require an additional network request, potentially improving load times compared to using an external image file.
