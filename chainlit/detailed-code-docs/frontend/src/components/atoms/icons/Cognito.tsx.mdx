### `Cognito`

#### Description
The `Cognito` component is a functional React component that returns an SVG element. This SVG represents the AWS Cognito logo, which is commonly used in user interfaces to indicate Cognito-related functionality or branding.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props.

#### Outputs
Returns a JSX element containing an SVG representation of the AWS Cognito logo.

#### Internal Logic
The component renders an SVG element with the following characteristics:
1. The SVG has a width and height of 24 pixels.
2. It uses a viewBox of "0 0 256 299" to define the coordinate system for the icon.
3. The `preserveAspectRatio` attribute is set to "xMidYMid" to maintain the aspect ratio while centering the content.
4. The icon is composed of several `path` elements, each representing different parts of the Cognito logo with specific colors:
   - Purple paths (`#7A3E65`)
   - Light pink path (`#CFB2C1`)
   - Dark purple path (`#512843`)
   - Pink paths (`#C17B9E`)

## Dependencies
This component doesn't have any external dependencies. It's a pure SVG implementation using React's JSX syntax.

## References
The `Cognito` component is referenced in the related file `frontend/src/components/molecules/auth/ProviderButton.tsx`. In this file, the `Cognito` component is imported and used as part of a function called `renderProviderIcon`. This function is responsible for rendering the appropriate icon for different authentication providers, including AWS Cognito.

```typescript
import { Cognito } from 'components/atoms/icons/Cognito';

// ...

function renderProviderIcon(provider: string) {
  switch (provider) {
    // ...
    case 'aws-cognito':
      return &lt;Cognito /&gt;;
    // ...
  }
}
```

This indicates that the `Cognito` icon is used as part of a larger authentication UI, specifically for representing the AWS Cognito service in provider buttons or other UI elements related to authentication options.
