## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `Step` that represents a single step in a process or conversation. It displays the step's name, status, and optionally its content, with the ability to expand or collapse the content.

## Code Structure
The `Step` component is the main export of this file. It uses several Material-UI components and custom icons to create its UI. The component's state is managed using React hooks, and it renders differently based on the step's properties and user interactions.

### Step
#### Description
A React functional component that renders a single step in a process or conversation.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| step | IStep | An object containing the step's details |
| children | ReactNode | Child components to be rendered when the step is expanded |
| isRunning | boolean | Optional flag indicating if the step is currently running |

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses `useState` to manage the open/closed state and hover state of the step.
2. Calculates whether the step is currently "using" based on its properties and the `isRunning` flag.
3. Determines if the step has output or sub-steps.
4. Renders a clickable header with the step name and status.
5. Conditionally renders a progress bar for running steps.
6. Displays chevron icons to indicate if the step can be expanded or collapsed.
7. When expanded, renders the child components in a styled box.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react | Core React library for building the component |
| @mui/material | Material-UI components for styling and layout |
| components/i18n | Translation component for internationalization |
| assets/chevronDown | Custom icon for collapsed state |
| assets/chevronUp | Custom icon for expanded state |
| client-types/ | Type definitions for the IStep interface |

## References
- The `IStep` interface is imported from 'client-types/', which defines the structure of a step object.
- The `Translator` component is used for internationalization of text.
- Custom `ChevronDownIcon` and `ChevronUpIcon` components are used for the expand/collapse functionality.

## Side Effects
- The component modifies its own state (open/closed and hover) based on user interactions.
- The component does not directly modify any external state or resources.

## Performance Considerations
- The `useMemo` hook is used to optimize the calculation of the `using` variable, preventing unnecessary recalculations on re-renders.

This component is designed to be flexible and reusable, capable of displaying various types of steps in a process or conversation, with a focus on providing clear visual feedback about the step's status and content.
