### UserMessage
#### Description
A React component that renders a user's message in a chat interface. It provides functionality for displaying and editing messages.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| message | IStep | The message object to be displayed |
| children | React.ReactNode | Child components to be rendered within the message |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves configuration and chat interaction functions from context and hooks.
2. Manages the editing state of the message.
3. Renders the message content or an editable text field based on the editing state.
4. Provides buttons for editing and confirming edits.
5. Applies conditional styling based on the editing state and configuration.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @mui/material | UI components and styling |
| @chainlit/react-client | Chat interaction hooks and state management |
| react | Core React library |
| recoil | State management |

## Side Effects
- Modifies the global message state when editing a message.
- Interacts with the chat context to update messages.

## Performance Considerations
The component uses `useRef` for the text field to avoid unnecessary re-renders when editing the message content.

___

This component is part of a larger chat interface system, integrating with other components and contexts to provide a complete chat experience. It relies on the `MessageContext` for chat-related functions and state, and uses Recoil for global state management.
