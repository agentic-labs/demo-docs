## High-level description
The `MessageContainer` component is a React functional component that serves as a container for rendering messages in a chat-like interface. It provides a context for messages and wraps the `Messages` component, passing down necessary props and context values.

## Code Structure
The `MessageContainer` component is defined using React's `memo` for performance optimization. It takes props including actions, context, elements, and messages, and renders a `MessageContext.Provider` wrapping the `Messages` component.

## References
- `MessageContext` and `defaultMessageContext` from 'contexts/MessageContext'
- `Messages` component from './Messages'
- Types from 'client-types/' and 'types/messageContext'

### MessageContainer
#### Description
A memoized React component that serves as a container for messages, providing context and rendering the `Messages` component.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| actions | IAction[] | Array of action objects |
| context | IMessageContext | Context object for messages |
| elements | IMessageElement[] | Array of message elements |
| messages | IStep[] | Array of message steps |

#### Internal Logic
1. Wraps the `Messages` component with `MessageContext.Provider`
2. Passes down props to the `Messages` component
3. Uses the provided `context` or falls back to `defaultMessageContext`

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react | For using React features like memo and JSX |
| contexts/MessageContext | Provides MessageContext and defaultMessageContext |
| client-types/ | Imports types for actions, message elements, and steps |
| types/messageContext | Imports IMessageContext type |

## Performance Considerations
The component uses `memo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders when its props haven't changed, which can improve performance in scenarios where the parent component re-renders frequently.

## Related Components
The `MessageContainer` is closely related to the `Messages` component, which it renders as a child. The `Messages` component (from the related code snippets) is responsible for actually rendering the individual messages and handling various message types and states.

## Context Usage
The component provides a `MessageContext` to its children, allowing them to access shared message-related data and functions. This context includes various properties and functions related to message handling, such as file uploads, user interactions, and feedback management.
