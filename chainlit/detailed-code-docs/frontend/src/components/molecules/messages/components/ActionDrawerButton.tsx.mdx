## High-level description
The `ActionDrawerButton` component is a React component that creates a button with a dropdown menu containing a list of actions. It's designed to display additional actions that may not fit in the main UI, providing a compact way to access these actions through a "More Actions" button.

## Code Structure
The main component `ActionDrawerButton` uses several Material-UI components to create the button and menu structure. It manages its own state for the menu anchor element and renders child `ActionButton` components for each action in the dropdown.

## References
This component references the `IAction` type from 'client-types/' and the `ActionButton` component from './ActionButton'.

### ActionDrawerButton
#### Description
A functional component that renders a button with a dropdown menu containing action buttons.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| actions | IAction[] | An array of action objects to be displayed in the dropdown menu |

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses the `useState` hook to manage the anchor element for the dropdown menu.
2. Renders an `IconButton` with a `MoreVertIcon` that opens the dropdown menu when clicked.
3. Renders a `Menu` component that displays when the button is clicked, containing `ActionButton` components for each action.
4. The menu is styled with custom shadow based on the theme's mode (light or dark).

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react | For using React hooks and components |
| @mui/icons-material | For the MoreVertIcon |
| @mui/material | For various UI components (IconButton, Menu, Stack, Tooltip) |

## Performance Considerations
The component re-renders when the `anchorEl` state changes (menu opens/closes). It also maps through the `actions` array to render `ActionButton` components, which could impact performance if the array is very large.

## Side Effects
The component manages its own state for the menu anchor, which affects the UI by opening and closing the dropdown menu.

## API/Interface Reference
| Prop | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| actions | IAction[] | An array of action objects to be displayed in the dropdown menu |

Note: The `IAction` interface is imported from 'client-types/' and includes properties such as `id`, `onClick`, and potentially others like `label` or `name` which are used in the `ActionButton` component.
