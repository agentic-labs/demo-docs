## High-level description
This code defines a `FeedbackButtons` component that allows users to provide feedback on messages in a chat interface. It includes thumbs up and down buttons for positive and negative feedback, as well as a dialog for adding comments to the feedback.

## Code Structure
The main `FeedbackButtons` component uses various React hooks and Material-UI components to manage state and render the UI. It interacts with a `MessageContext` to handle feedback updates and deletions. The component also uses custom icons for the feedback buttons and integrates with the chat session state.

### FeedbackButtons
#### Description
A React component that renders feedback buttons (thumbs up/down) and a dialog for adding comments to the feedback.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| message | IStep | The message object for which feedback is being provided |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes state for feedback, comment, and dialog visibility.
2. Defines handlers for feedback changes and button clicks.
3. Renders feedback buttons and a dialog for adding comments.
4. Updates feedback state and triggers callbacks when feedback is changed or deleted.

### handleFeedbackChanged
#### Description
A function that updates or deletes feedback for a message.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| feedback | number \| undefined | The feedback value (0 for negative, 1 for positive, undefined for deletion) |
| comment | string \| undefined | Optional comment associated with the feedback |

#### Internal Logic
1. If feedback is undefined, it triggers the feedback deletion callback.
2. Otherwise, it triggers the feedback update callback with the new feedback data.

### handleFeedbackClick
#### Description
A function that handles the click event on feedback buttons.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| nextValue | number | The feedback value associated with the clicked button |

#### Internal Logic
1. If the clicked feedback matches the current feedback, it triggers feedback deletion.
2. Otherwise, it opens the feedback dialog for the clicked feedback value.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @mui/material | Provides UI components like IconButton, Stack, Tooltip, and Dialog |
| @chainlit/react-client | Provides hooks for chat session management |
| react | Core React library for building the component |
| recoil | State management library used for accessing global state |

## Side Effects
- Updates the feedback state in the parent component through the `onFeedbackUpdated` and `onFeedbackDeleted` callbacks.
- Opens and closes a dialog for adding comments to the feedback.

## Performance Considerations
The component uses `useMemo` to memoize the feedback buttons, which helps optimize re-renders when only the disabled state changes.
