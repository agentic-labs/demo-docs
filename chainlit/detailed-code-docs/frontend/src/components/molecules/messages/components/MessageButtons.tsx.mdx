## High-level description
The `MessageButtons` component is a React functional component that renders a set of buttons associated with a message in a chat interface. It includes buttons for copying message content, providing feedback, and debugging, depending on the message type and configuration.

## Code Structure
The main `MessageButtons` component uses several hooks and sub-components to render the appropriate buttons based on the message properties and application configuration. It imports and uses components like `ClipboardCopy`, `FeedbackButtons`, and `DebugButton`.

## Symbols

### MessageButtons
#### Description
This is the main functional component that renders a set of buttons for a given message.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| message | IStep | The message object for which buttons are being rendered |
| run | IStep (optional) | An optional run object, likely used for feedback |

#### Internal Logic
1. Determines whether to show various buttons based on message properties and configuration.
2. Renders a Stack component containing the appropriate buttons.
3. Returns null if no buttons should be shown or if the message is still streaming.

#### Outputs
Returns a React component (Stack) containing the message buttons, or null if no buttons should be displayed.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @mui/material | UI components (Stack) |
| @chainlit/react-client | Hooks for accessing chat messages and configuration |
| components/atoms/ClipboardCopy | Component for copying message content |
| hooks/useIsDarkMode | Custom hook to determine if dark mode is active |
| client-types | Type definitions |

## Side Effects
This component does not have any direct side effects, but it renders buttons that can trigger actions like copying to clipboard, providing feedback, or opening a debug view.

## Performance Considerations
The component uses memoization techniques (via the `useChatMessages` and `useConfig` hooks) to potentially optimize re-renders based on changes to chat messages or configuration.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this component. Error handling for actions triggered by the buttons (e.g., copying to clipboard) is likely handled in the respective sub-components or parent components.
