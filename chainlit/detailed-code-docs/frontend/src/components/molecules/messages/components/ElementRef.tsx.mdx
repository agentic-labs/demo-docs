## High-level description
The `ElementRef` component is a React component that renders either a span or a link based on the display property of an `IMessageElement`. It's designed to handle references to elements within messages, providing different visual representations and interactions depending on the element's configuration.

## Code Structure
The `ElementRef` component is a functional component that uses the React Context API to access a click handler. It renders different UI elements based on the `display` property of the input `element`.

## References
- `MessageContext` from 'contexts/MessageContext'
- `Link` from '@mui/material/Link'
- `IMessageElement` type from 'client-types/'

## Symbols

### ElementRef
#### Description
A React component that renders a reference to a message element, either as a bold inline text or as a clickable link.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| element | IMessageElement | The message element to be rendered as a reference |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the `onElementRefClick` function from the `MessageContext`.
2. If the element's `display` property is 'inline', renders a `span` with bold text.
3. Otherwise, renders a `Link` component that triggers `onElementRefClick` when clicked.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| React | Core library for building the component |
| @mui/material | Provides the Link component for styling |

## Side Effects
The component may trigger the `onElementRefClick` function when the link is clicked, potentially causing side effects in the parent components or application state.

## Performance Considerations
The component uses the `useContext` hook, which may cause re-renders if the `MessageContext` changes frequently. However, for most use cases, this should not be a significant performance concern.

___

This component is part of a larger system for rendering messages with interactive elements. It's used within the `Markdown` component (as seen in the related code snippets) to handle links that reference specific elements. The `MessageContext` provides the necessary click handler for interacting with these element references, allowing for dynamic behavior based on the application's needs.
