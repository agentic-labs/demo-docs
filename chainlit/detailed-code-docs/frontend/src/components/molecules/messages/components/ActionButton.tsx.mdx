## High-level description
The `ActionButton` component is a reusable React component that renders a button for an action in a messaging interface. It handles user interactions, displays action information, and integrates with a broader message context to manage its state and behavior.

## Code Structure
The `ActionButton` component is the main export of this file. It uses React hooks and Material-UI components to create an interactive button with a tooltip. The component relies on the `MessageContext` for managing its state and behavior.

## References
- `MessageContext` from 'contexts/MessageContext'
- `IAction` type from 'client-types/'
- Material-UI components: `Button` and `Tooltip`

### ActionButton
#### Description
A functional React component that renders an action button with a tooltip. It handles click events and manages its disabled state based on the current context.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| action | IAction | The action object containing details like id, name, label, description, and onClick handler |
| margin | number \| string | The margin to be applied to the button |
| onClick | () =&gt; void (optional) | An additional click handler to be called when the button is clicked |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves `askUser` and `loading` from the `MessageContext`.
2. Determines if the button should be disabled based on the current context.
3. Defines a `handleClick` function that either calls the `askUser` callback or the action's `onClick` method.
4. Renders a `Tooltip` component wrapping a `Button` component with the appropriate props and styling.

## Side Effects
The component may trigger side effects through the `askUser` callback or the action's `onClick` method when the button is clicked.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react | For using React hooks and components |
| @mui/material | For using Material-UI components (Button and Tooltip) |

## Error Handling
This component doesn't implement explicit error handling. Errors would be propagated to parent components or handled by React's error boundaries.

## API/Interface Reference
The `ActionButton` component expects props that conform to the `ActionProps` interface:

| Prop | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| action | IAction | The action object to be represented by the button |
| margin | number \| string | The margin to be applied to the button |
| onClick | () =&gt; void (optional) | An additional click handler |

The `IAction` interface (imported from 'client-types/') is expected to have the following properties:

| Property | Type | Description |
|:---------|:-----|:------------|
| id | string | Unique identifier for the action |
| name | string | Name of the action |
| label | string (optional) | Label to be displayed on the button |
| description | string | Description of the action (used in the tooltip) |
| onClick | () =&gt; void | Function to be called when the action is triggered |

Note: The actual implementation of `IAction` may have additional properties not used in this component.
