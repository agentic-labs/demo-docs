## High-level description
This file serves as an index for authentication-related components in the frontend application. It exports four authentication components: AuthLogin, AuthForgotPassword, AuthResetPassword, and AuthVerifyEmail, making them easily accessible for use in other parts of the application.

## Symbols

### `AuthLogin`
#### Description
Exported authentication component for user login functionality.

### `AuthForgotPassword`
#### Description
Exported authentication component for handling forgotten password scenarios. This component allows users to request a password reset by entering their email address.

### `AuthResetPassword`
#### Description
Exported authentication component for resetting a user's password. This component is typically used after a user has requested a password reset and received a reset token.

### `AuthVerifyEmail`
#### Description
Exported authentication component for email verification processes.

## Dependencies
The file doesn't directly import any external libraries, but it relies on the existence of the exported components in their respective files within the same directory.

## Code Structure
This index file uses named exports to make the authentication components available for import elsewhere in the application. Each component is likely defined in its own file (e.g., AuthLogin.tsx, AuthForgotPassword.tsx, etc.) within the same directory.

## References
While not explicitly shown in this file, the exported components are referenced and used in other parts of the application where authentication functionality is needed.

## Notes
1. The use of an index file like this is a common pattern in React applications to simplify imports and organize related components.
2. The components exported here cover various aspects of the authentication flow: login, password recovery, password reset, and email verification.
3. Based on the related code snippets provided, we can see that at least AuthForgotPassword and AuthResetPassword are complex components with form handling, validation, and state management.
4. These components likely work together to provide a complete authentication experience for the user, although the specific interactions between them would depend on how they are used in the parent components or pages.
