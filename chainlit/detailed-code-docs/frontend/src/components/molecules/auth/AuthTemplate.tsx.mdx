### `AuthTemplate`
#### Description
`AuthTemplate` is a functional component that renders a standardized layout for authentication pages. It uses Material-UI components to create a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| children | React.ReactNode | The main content to be rendered inside the template |
| renderLogo | React.ReactElement (optional) | A custom logo element to be displayed at the top of the template |
| title | React.ReactNode \| string (optional) | The title to be displayed below the logo |

#### Internal Logic
1. The component uses a `Stack` component as the outer container, which takes up the full viewport height and width.
2. Inside the `Stack`, there's a `Box` component that serves as the main content container. This box has responsive styling applied using Material-UI's theme and breakpoints.
3. Within the main content box, another `Stack` is used to arrange the logo and title (if provided).
4. The `children` prop is rendered inside a final `Stack` component, allowing for flexible content layout.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @mui/material | Provides UI components (Box, Stack, Typography) for layout and styling |

## Performance Considerations
The component uses Material-UI's `sx` prop for styling, which allows for theme-aware and responsive styles. This approach is generally efficient but may have a slight performance impact compared to static CSS.

## References
This component is used by other authentication-related components in the application, such as:
- `AuthResetPassword`
- `AuthForgotPassword`
- `AuthLogin`
- `AuthVerifyEmail`

These components pass in their specific content as children to the `AuthTemplate`, ensuring a consistent layout across different authentication flows.
