## High-level description
The `AuthResetPassword` component is a React component that provides a form for users to reset their password. It uses Formik for form management, Yup for form validation, and Material-UI components for the user interface. The component handles the password reset process, including error handling and loading states.

## Code Structure
The main component `AuthResetPassword` uses several hooks and components to manage its state and render the UI. It utilizes the `useFormik` hook for form management, `useState` for local state management, and `useTranslation` for internationalization. The component renders an `AuthTemplate` wrapper and includes form inputs and a submit button.
