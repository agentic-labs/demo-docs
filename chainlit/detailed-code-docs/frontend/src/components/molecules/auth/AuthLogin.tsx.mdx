## High-level description
The `AuthLogin` component is a versatile authentication form that supports both password-based and OAuth-based login methods. It provides functionality for sign-in, sign-up, and password recovery, with customizable options for password validation and multiple OAuth providers.

## Code Structure
The main `AuthLogin` component uses several sub-components and hooks to manage its state and render different parts of the form. It interacts with external authentication functions passed as props to handle user actions.

### AuthLogin
#### Description
A React component that renders a customizable authentication form with various login options.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| title | React.ReactNode \| string | The title of the authentication form |
| error | string | Optional error message to display |
| providers | string[] | List of OAuth providers |
| callbackUrl | string | URL to redirect after successful authentication |
| onPasswordSignIn | function | Optional callback for password-based sign-in |
| onOAuthSignIn | function | Optional callback for OAuth-based sign-in |
| onSignUp | function | Optional callback for user sign-up |
| onForgotPassword | function | Optional callback for password recovery |
| renderLogo | React.ReactElement | Optional logo element to render |
| passwordChecklistSettings | object | Optional settings for password validation |

#### Internal Logic
1. Manages form state using Formik
2. Toggles between sign-in and sign-up modes
3. Handles password visibility
4. Validates password strength if required
5. Renders different UI elements based on available authentication options
6. Handles form submission and error display

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| formik | Form state management |
| react-password-checklist | Password strength validation |
| @mui/material | UI components |
| components/atoms/inputs/TextInput | Custom text input component |
| components/i18n/Translator | Internationalization |
| AuthTemplate | Layout template for authentication forms |
| ProviderButton | Button component for OAuth providers |

## Error Handling
The component displays error messages using MUI's Alert component. Errors can come from the `error` prop or be set internally after failed authentication attempts.

## API/Interface Reference
The component exposes several callback functions as props:

| Prop | Description |
|:-----|:------------|
| onPasswordSignIn | Called with (email, password, callbackUrl) for password-based sign-in |
| onOAuthSignIn | Called with (provider, callbackUrl) for OAuth-based sign-in |
| onSignUp | Called with (email, password, callbackUrl) for user sign-up |
| onForgotPassword | Called when the user clicks the "Forgot Password" link |

These functions should return Promises that resolve on successful authentication or reject with an error message on failure.
