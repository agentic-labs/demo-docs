## High-level description
The `AuthVerifyEmail` component is a React functional component that renders a user interface for email verification. It provides a form for users to resend verification emails and displays success or error messages accordingly. The component uses Material-UI components and a custom translation system for internationalization.

## Code Structure
The main `AuthVerifyEmail` component uses several imported components and hooks, including Material-UI components, custom translation components, and the `AuthTemplate` component. It manages its own state for loading, error, and success messages, and handles the email resend functionality.

### AuthVerifyEmail
#### Description
A functional component that renders an email verification interface, allowing users to resend verification emails and displaying relevant messages.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| email | string | The email address to be verified |
| onGoBack | () =&gt; void | Function to handle going back to the previous screen |
| onResend | (value: string) =&gt; Promise&lt;void&gt; | Function to handle resending the verification email |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSX.Element | React component | The rendered email verification interface |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes state variables for loading, error, and success messages.
2. Defines an `onSubmit` function to handle resending the verification email:
   - Sets loading state
   - Calls the `onResend` function with the email
   - Updates success or error state based on the result
3. Renders the `AuthTemplate` component with custom logo and content:
   - Displays error and success alerts when applicable
   - Shows instructions and the email address to be verified
   - Provides a button to resend the verification email
   - Includes a link to go back to the previous screen

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react | Core React library |
| @mui/icons-material | Material-UI icons |
| @mui/material | Material-UI components |
| components/i18n | Custom internationalization components |

## Error Handling
The component handles errors by catching exceptions in the `onSubmit` function and setting the error message in the component's state. Errors are then displayed to the user via an Alert component.

## Logging
This component does not implement any specific logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference
This component does not expose an API. It receives props for email, onGoBack, and onResend functions, which are used internally to manage the email verification process.
