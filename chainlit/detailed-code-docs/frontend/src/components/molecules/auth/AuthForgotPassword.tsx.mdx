## High-level description
The `AuthForgotPassword` component is a React component that implements a forgot password functionality. It provides a form for users to enter their email address and request a password reset. The component handles form validation, submission, and displays appropriate feedback to the user.

## Code Structure
The main component `AuthForgotPassword` uses the `useFormik` hook for form management and validation. It also utilizes the `AuthTemplate` component for layout and styling. The component manages its state using React's `useState` hook and integrates with a translation system using the `useTranslation` hook.
