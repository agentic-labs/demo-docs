## High-level description
The `BlinkingCursor` component is a React component that renders a blinking cursor animation. It's designed to be used as a visual indicator, typically in text-based interfaces to simulate a typing or waiting effect.

## Symbols

### `blink`
#### Description
A keyframe animation that defines the blinking effect for the cursor.

#### Internal Logic
The animation alternates the opacity of the element from 1 (fully visible) to 0 (invisible) and back to 1, creating a blinking effect.

### `CURSOR_PLACEHOLDER`
#### Description
A constant that holds a zero-width space character (`\u200B`), used as a placeholder for the cursor in text.

### `BlinkingCursor`
#### Description
The main functional component that renders the blinking cursor.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| whitespace | boolean | Optional. Determines whether to add whitespace before the cursor. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Returns a `Box` component from Material-UI.
2. Applies styling to create a small, circular shape.
3. Uses the `blink` animation to create the blinking effect.
4. Conditionally adds left margin if `whitespace` prop is true.

## References
This component is referenced in:
1. `MessageContent.tsx`: Uses `CURSOR_PLACEHOLDER` to add a cursor at the end of streaming messages.
2. `Markdown.tsx`: Implements a custom plugin to replace `CURSOR_PLACEHOLDER` with the `BlinkingCursor` component in markdown content.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @emotion/react | Used for the `keyframes` function to define the blink animation. |
| @mui/material | Provides the `Box` component for rendering the cursor. |

## Usage Context
The `BlinkingCursor` component is primarily used in text-based interfaces to indicate ongoing processes or simulate typing effects. It's integrated into the markdown rendering system of the application, allowing it to be dynamically inserted into text content.

In the `Markdown` component, a custom plugin is implemented to replace occurrences of the `CURSOR_PLACEHOLDER` with the `BlinkingCursor` component. This allows for seamless integration of the blinking cursor effect within markdown-rendered text.

The `MessageContent` component uses the `CURSOR_PLACEHOLDER` to add a cursor at the end of streaming messages, creating a visual indication that more content is being loaded or generated.
