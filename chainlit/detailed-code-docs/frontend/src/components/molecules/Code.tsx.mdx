## High-level description
The `Code` component is a React component that renders code snippets with syntax highlighting and a copy-to-clipboard feature. It uses the `highlight.js` library for syntax highlighting and supports both highlighted and non-highlighted code display based on the input.

## Code Structure
The file contains two main components: `CodeSnippet` and `Code`. `CodeSnippet` is a child component used by `Code` to render highlighted code. The `Code` component is the main exported component that handles the overall rendering of the code block, including the language label and copy button.

- Custom hook: useIsDarkMode

### CodeSnippet
#### Description
A component that renders a code snippet with syntax highlighting using `highlight.js`.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| language | string | The programming language of the code snippet |
| children | string | The actual code content |

#### Internal Logic
- Uses a `useEffect` hook to apply syntax highlighting to the code element on component mount.
- Renders the code inside a `&lt;pre&gt;` and `&lt;code&gt;` element with specific styling.

### Code
#### Description
The main component that renders a code block with a language label, copy button, and the code content (either highlighted or non-highlighted).

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| children | any | The code content and other props passed to the component |
| props | any | Additional properties, including node information |

#### Internal Logic
- Determines whether to use syntax highlighting based on the presence of a language class and code content.
- Renders either a `CodeSnippet` component for highlighted code or a simple `Box` with `code` element for non-highlighted code.
- Displays a header with the language label and a copy button.
- Uses the `useIsDarkMode` hook to apply appropriate styling based on the current theme.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| highlight.js | Syntax highlighting for code snippets |
| @mui/material | UI components (Box, Stack, Typography) |
| components/atoms/ClipboardCopy | Copy-to-clipboard functionality |
| hooks/useIsDarkMode | Determine if dark mode is active |

## Performance Considerations
The component uses `useEffect` to apply syntax highlighting only once when the component mounts, which helps optimize performance by avoiding unnecessary re-renders.

## Error Handling
The component doesn't implement specific error handling mechanisms. It uses optional chaining and nullish coalescing operators to safely access potentially undefined properties, preventing runtime errors.
