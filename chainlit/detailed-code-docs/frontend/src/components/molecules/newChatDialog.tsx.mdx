### NewChatDialog
#### Description
A functional React component that renders a dialog box for confirming the creation of a new chat. It uses Material-UI's Dialog component and custom buttons to create a styled confirmation dialog.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| open | boolean | Controls whether the dialog is open or closed |
| handleClose | () =&gt; void | Function to be called when the dialog is closed |
| handleConfirm | () =&gt; void | Function to be called when the user confirms the action |

#### Internal Logic
1. The component renders a Material-UI Dialog component with custom styling.
2. The dialog contains a title, content, and two action buttons.
3. The title and content use the `Translator` component for internationalization.
4. The action buttons are custom `RegularButton` and `AccentButton` components.
5. The confirm button is set to `autoFocus` for improved user experience.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @mui/material | Provides Dialog and related components |
| components/atoms/buttons | Custom button components (AccentButton, RegularButton) |
| components/i18n | Translator component for internationalization |

## References
- The `NewChatDialog` component is used in the `NewChatButton` component (from the related code snippets).
- The `Translator` component is imported from 'components/i18n'.
- `AccentButton` and `RegularButton` are imported from 'components/atoms/buttons'.

## Notes
- The component uses Material-UI's theming system, as evidenced by the `sx` prop usage for custom styling.
- The dialog's background image is explicitly set to 'none' using the `PaperProps` prop.
- The component relies on internationalization, using the `Translator` component for all text content.

This component is part of a larger application that likely manages chat sessions and provides a way for users to start new chats with a confirmation step.
