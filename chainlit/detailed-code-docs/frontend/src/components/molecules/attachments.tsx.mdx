## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `Attachments` that renders a list of file attachments. It uses Recoil for state management and Material-UI (MUI) for styling. The component displays each attachment with options to cancel ongoing uploads or remove already uploaded attachments.

## Code Structure
The main `Attachments` component uses the `attachmentsState` from Recoil to get the list of attachments. It then maps over this list to render individual `Attachment` components, along with progress indicators or remove buttons as needed.

## References
- `attachmentsState` from 'state/chat'
- `Attachment` component from 'components/atoms/Attachment'
- `CircularProgressIconButton` from 'components/atoms/buttons/progressIconButton'
- `Translator` from 'components/i18n'

## Symbols

### Attachments
#### Description
A functional component that renders a list of file attachments.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props directly.

#### Outputs
Returns a JSX.Element representing the rendered attachments.

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the attachments from the Recoil state.
2. If there are no attachments, it returns an empty fragment.
3. For each attachment, it renders:
   - A progress indicator if the attachment is being uploaded.
   - A remove button if the attachment has been uploaded.
   - The `Attachment` component to display the file information.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @mui/material | UI components and styling |
| @mui/icons-material | Icons for the UI |
| recoil | State management |

## Performance Considerations
The component uses `useRecoilValue` to efficiently access the attachments state. The rendering of individual attachments is done using `map`, which is generally efficient for lists. However, for very large numbers of attachments, further optimization might be needed.

## Error Handling
There's no explicit error handling in this component. Error handling for file uploads and removals should be managed in the parent components or in the state management logic.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code.
