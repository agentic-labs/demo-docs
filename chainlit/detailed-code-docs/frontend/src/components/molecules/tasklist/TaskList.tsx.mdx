## High-level description
This code defines a `TaskList` component in React, which displays a list of tasks with their status. It supports both mobile and desktop views, and integrates with the Chainlit API to fetch task data.

## Code Structure
The main `TaskList` component uses several custom hooks and components to render the task list. It relies on the `useChatData` hook for task data, `useApi` for API calls, and various Material-UI components for styling.

## Symbols

### `Header`
#### Description
A functional component that renders the header of the task list, including a title and status chip.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| status | string | The status of the task list |

#### Internal Logic
- Uses Material-UI components to create a styled header with a title and status chip.
- Applies custom styling based on the current theme.

### `TaskList`
#### Description
The main component that renders the task list, supporting both mobile and desktop views.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| isMobile | boolean | Determines whether to render the mobile or desktop version |

#### Internal Logic
1. Fetches task list data using the `useChatData` and `useApi` hooks.
2. Processes the URL to remove the base URL for API calls.
3. Renders a loading or error message if necessary.
4. For mobile view:
   - Displays only one task (either the first running/ready task or the latest task).
5. For desktop view:
   - Renders all tasks in a scrollable list.
6. Applies custom styling based on the current theme.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react | Core React library |
| @mui/material | Material-UI components for styling |
| @chainlit/react-client | Custom hooks for chat data and API interactions |
| components/i18n | Translation utilities |
| theme | Custom theme colors |

## Error Handling
The component handles API errors by displaying an error message using the `Translator` component.

## Performance Considerations
- The component uses `useMemo` to optimize the URL processing for API calls.
- It keeps previous data while loading new data to improve perceived performance.

This `TaskList` component provides a flexible and responsive way to display task information in both mobile and desktop environments, integrating seamlessly with the Chainlit API and Material-UI styling system.
