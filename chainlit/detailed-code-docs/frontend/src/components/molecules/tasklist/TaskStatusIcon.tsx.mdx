## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `TaskStatusIcon` that renders different icons based on the status of a task. It uses Material-UI components and custom SVG paths to create visually distinct icons for various task statuses: running, done, ready, and failed.

### `TaskStatusIcon`
#### Description
A React functional component that renders an icon representing the status of a task.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| status | ITask['status'] | The status of the task ('running', 'done', 'ready', or 'failed') |

#### Outputs
Returns a React element representing the appropriate icon based on the task status.

#### Internal Logic
1. If the status is 'running', it renders a circular progress indicator.
2. For other statuses, it renders an SVG icon with different paths and colors:
   - 'done': A green circle with a white checkmark
   - 'ready': A grey circular outline
   - 'failed': A red circle with a white 'X' mark

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @mui/material | Provides UI components (Box, CircularProgress, SvgIcon) |
| theme | Imports color constants (green, grey, primary, white) |

## Code Structure
The component uses conditional rendering based on the `status` prop to determine which icon to display. It leverages Material-UI's `SvgIcon` component for custom SVG rendering and `CircularProgress` for the 'running' status.

## References
- `ITask` interface (imported from './Task', but not shown in the provided code)
- Color constants from the theme (imported from 'theme')

## Performance Considerations
The component uses inline SVG paths, which are efficient for rendering and allow for easy color customization. The use of Material-UI's `SvgIcon` component ensures proper scaling and alignment within the UI.

This component is likely used in conjunction with a task list or task management interface, where it provides visual feedback on the status of individual tasks. The color scheme and icon designs are consistent with common UI patterns for task status representation.
