## High-level description
This file, `vite-env.d.ts`, is a TypeScript declaration file that extends the global type definitions for a Vite-based project. It includes type references for Vite and a Vite SVG plugin, and declares a module for 'react-mentions-continued'.

## Symbols

### `/// &lt;reference types="vite/client" /&gt;`
#### Description
This triple-slash directive tells TypeScript to include type definitions for Vite's client-side APIs. It ensures that TypeScript recognizes Vite-specific globals and modules when type-checking the project.

### `/// &lt;reference types="vite-plugin-svgr/client" /&gt;`
#### Description
This triple-slash directive includes type definitions for the Vite plugin SVGR, which allows importing SVG files as React components. It ensures TypeScript understands the imports of SVG files as React components.

### `declare module 'react-mentions-continued'`
#### Description
This declaration informs TypeScript about the existence of the 'react-mentions-continued' module without specifying its exact types. It allows the use of this module in the project without TypeScript throwing errors about unknown imports.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| vite | Provides type definitions for Vite's client-side APIs |
| vite-plugin-svgr | Provides type definitions for importing SVG files as React components |
| react-mentions-continued | External library used in the project, declared to avoid TypeScript errors |

Note: The actual implementation of 'react-mentions-continued' is not included in this file. This declaration simply tells TypeScript that such a module exists and can be imported.
