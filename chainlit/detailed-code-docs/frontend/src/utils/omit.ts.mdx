## High-level description
The `omit` function is a utility that creates a new object by copying all properties from the input object except for the specified properties. This is useful for removing unwanted properties from an object, particularly when working with component props or API payloads.

## Symbols

### `omit`
#### Description
The `omit` function takes an object and a list of property keys, and returns a new object with all properties of the original object except those specified in the list of keys to omit.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| object | T extends Record&lt;string, any&gt; | The input object from which properties will be omitted |
| ...props | K extends keyof T[] | A rest parameter of keys to be omitted from the object |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Omit&lt;T, K&gt; | A new object with all properties of the input object except those specified in `props` |

#### Internal Logic
1. Create a shallow copy of the input object using the spread operator.
2. Iterate through the list of properties to omit.
3. For each property, delete it from the copied object.
4. Return the resulting object.

## Dependencies
The code does not rely on any external libraries or modules.

## Usage Example
Based on the related code snippet provided, we can see an example of how the `omit` function is used in the `FormInput` component:

```typescript
import omit from 'utils/omit';

// ...

const FormInput = ({ element }: { element: TFormInput }): JSX.Element =&gt; {
  switch (element?.type) {
    case 'select':
      return (
        &lt;SelectInput
          {...omit(element, 'setField')}
          value={element.value ?? ''}
        /&gt;
      );
    // ...
  }
};
```

In this example, the `omit` function is used to remove the 'setField' property from the `element` object before spreading the remaining properties into the `SelectInput` component. This is done to avoid passing down props that are not needed by the child component and to prevent React warnings about unrecognized props.

## Performance Considerations
The `omit` function creates a new object and performs deletions, which can be less efficient for large objects or when called frequently. For performance-critical scenarios, consider using object destructuring or more optimized methods if dealing with a known set of properties.
