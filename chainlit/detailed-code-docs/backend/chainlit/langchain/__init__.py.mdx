## High-level description
This code is responsible for ensuring that the correct version of LangChain is installed before proceeding with the rest of the application. It checks if the installed LangChain version is at least 0.0.198, raising a ValueError if the requirement is not met.

## Symbols

### `check_module_version`
#### Description
This function is imported from the `chainlit.utils` module and is used to verify if a specific module is installed and meets the minimum required version.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| name | str | The name of the module to check |
| required_version | str | The minimum required version of the module |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | bool | True if the module is installed and meets the version requirement, False otherwise |

#### Internal Logic
The function attempts to import the specified module and compares its version with the required version using the `version.parse()` method from the `packaging` library.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| chainlit.utils | Provides the `check_module_version` function |

## Error Handling
The code raises a `ValueError` with a specific message if the LangChain version requirement is not met. This error message instructs the user to upgrade LangChain using pip.

## Performance Considerations
The version check is performed at import time, which means it will run every time the module is imported. This could potentially impact the startup time of the application, especially if many such checks are performed across different modules.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in this code snippet.
