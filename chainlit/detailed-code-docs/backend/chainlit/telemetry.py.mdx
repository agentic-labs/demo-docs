## High-level description
This file implements telemetry functionality for the Chainlit application. It provides a `ChainlitTelemetry` class that configures and manages a tracer for collecting telemetry data. The file also includes utility functions for tracing events and decorating functions with tracing capabilities.

## Code Structure
The main components of this code are:
1. `ChainlitTelemetry` class: Manages the configuration and initialization of the tracer.
2. `chainlit_telemetry` instance: A global instance of `ChainlitTelemetry`.
3. `trace_event` function: A utility function to trace events.
4. `trace` decorator: A decorator to add tracing to functions.

These components work together to provide telemetry functionality throughout the Chainlit application.

## Symbols

### ChainlitTelemetry
#### Description
A class that manages the configuration and initialization of the OpenTelemetry tracer for Chainlit.

#### Internal Logic
- Implements a custom `_build_resource` method to hash the hostname for privacy.
- Configures the tracer using Uptrace with specific settings.
- Provides a `tracer` property that lazily initializes the tracer when first accessed.

### chainlit_telemetry
#### Description
A global instance of the `ChainlitTelemetry` class.

### trace_event
#### Description
A function that traces an event using the configured tracer if telemetry is enabled.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| event_name | str | The name of the event to trace |

#### Internal Logic
- Checks if telemetry is enabled in the project configuration.
- If enabled, starts a new span with the given event name using the tracer.

### trace
#### Description
A decorator that adds tracing to a function, wrapping its execution in a span.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| func | Callable | The function to be traced |

#### Internal Logic
- Creates a wrapper function that starts a new span for the decorated function.
- The span name is set to the function's name.
- Executes the original function within the span context.
- Works with both synchronous and asynchronous functions.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| opentelemetry | Provides the OpenTelemetry tracing functionality |
| uptrace | Used to configure and initialize the OpenTelemetry tracer |
| chainlit.config | Imports the Chainlit configuration |
| chainlit.version | Imports the Chainlit version information |

## Error Handling
The code includes basic error handling, such as checking if telemetry is enabled before tracing events. However, it does not implement extensive error handling or logging for tracer configuration issues.

Your response should not exceed 3000 words or 4000 tokens. Focus on providing clear, concise information that can be directly inferred from the code. Include optional sections only when they provide significant value for understanding the code.
