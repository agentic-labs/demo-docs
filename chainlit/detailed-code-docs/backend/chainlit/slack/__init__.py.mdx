## High-level description
This code snippet is a part of the Chainlit backend, specifically for Slack integration. It attempts to import the `slack_bolt` package and raises a helpful error message if the package is not found, guiding users to install it.

## Symbols

### try-except block
#### Description
This block attempts to import the `slack_bolt` module and handles the case where the module is not found.

#### Internal Logic
1. The code tries to import the `slack_bolt` module.
2. If a `ModuleNotFoundError` is raised (indicating the module is not installed), it raises a `ValueError` with a descriptive error message.

## Error Handling
The code implements a specific error handling mechanism:

- If the `slack_bolt` module is not found, it raises a `ValueError` with a custom error message.
- The error message informs the user that the `slack_bolt` package is required for Slack integration with Chainlit and provides instructions on how to install it using pip.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| slack_bolt | Required for integrating Chainlit with a Slack app |

Note: The `slack_bolt` dependency is not directly imported in this file but is checked for availability.

## TODOs
