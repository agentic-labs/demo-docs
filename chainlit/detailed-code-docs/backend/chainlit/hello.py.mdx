Here's a documentation for the provided target file:

## High-level description
This file contains a simple example of a Chainlit app. It demonstrates how to use the `@on_chat_start` decorator to define an asynchronous function that runs when a chat session starts. The function asks for the user's name and responds with a confirmation message.

## Symbols

### `main`
#### Description
An asynchronous function decorated with `@on_chat_start` that runs when a chat session starts. It asks for the user's name and sends a confirmation message.

#### Inputs
This function doesn't take any explicit inputs.

#### Outputs
This function doesn't return any value explicitly.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses `AskUserMessage` to prompt the user for their name.
2. Waits for the user's response with a 30-second timeout.
3. If a response is received, sends a confirmation message using `Message`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| chainlit | Provides the core functionality for building the Chainlit app |

## References
- `chainlit.AskUserMessage`: Used to prompt the user for input
- `chainlit.Message`: Used to send a message to the user
- `chainlit.on_chat_start`: Decorator to specify the function to run when a chat session starts

This example demonstrates the basic structure of a Chainlit app and how to interact with users using messages and prompts. It serves as a simple test to ensure that the Chainlit installation is working correctly and provides a starting point for building more complex Chainlit applications.
