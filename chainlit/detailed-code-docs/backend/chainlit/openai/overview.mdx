Here's a detailed documentation of the target file `backend/chainlit/openai/__init__.py`:

## High-level description
This file provides functionality to instrument OpenAI API calls for integration with Chainlit. It ensures the correct version of OpenAI is installed and sets up a callback mechanism to capture and process generation events.

## Code Structure
The main function `instrument_openai()` is defined, which sets up the instrumentation for OpenAI API calls. It uses a callback function `on_new_generation()` to process generation events and create corresponding Chainlit steps.

## Symbols

### `instrument_openai()`
#### Description
This function sets up the instrumentation for OpenAI API calls. It checks the installed OpenAI version, imports the necessary instrumentation function, and sets up a callback to process generation events.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the installed OpenAI version is at least 1.0.0.
2. Imports the `instrument_openai` function from `literalai.instrumentation.openai`.
3. Defines an `on_new_generation` callback function to process generation events.
4. Calls the imported `instrument_openai` function with the callback.

### `on_new_generation(generation, timing)`
#### Description
This is a callback function that processes generation events from OpenAI API calls. It creates and sends a Chainlit Step object for each generation event.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| generation | Union[ChatGeneration, CompletionGeneration] | The generation object from OpenAI |
| timing | Dict | Timing information for the generation |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the current context and determines the parent step if any.
2. Creates a new Chainlit Step object with appropriate metadata.
3. Sets the generation, start time, and end time for the step.
4. Processes the input and output based on the generation type (chat or completion).
5. Asynchronously sends the step to be displayed in the Chainlit UI.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| asyncio | For creating asynchronous tasks |
| chainlit.context | To access the current Chainlit context |
| chainlit.step | For creating Step objects |
| chainlit.utils | For version checking |
| literalai | For types and helper functions |

## Error Handling
The function raises a `ValueError` if the installed OpenAI version is less than 1.0.0.

## Performance Considerations
The function creates asynchronous tasks for sending steps, which helps in non-blocking execution of the instrumentation process.
