## High-level description
This file serves as the entry point for the Chainlit CLI application. It imports the `cli` function from the `chainlit.cli` module and executes it when the script is run directly.

## Symbols

### `__main__`
#### Description
This is the main entry point of the script. It checks if the script is being run directly (not imported as a module) and if so, it calls the `cli` function with the program name "chainlit".

#### Internal Logic
1. The script checks if it's being run as the main program using the `if __name__ == "__main__":` condition.
2. If true, it calls the `cli` function imported from `chainlit.cli`, passing "chainlit" as the `prog_name` argument.

## References
- `chainlit.cli.cli`: This function is imported and called in the main block. It's likely the main command-line interface function for the Chainlit application.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| chainlit.cli | Provides the `cli` function, which is the main entry point for the Chainlit command-line interface |

## Notes
This file is a simple entry point that delegates the main functionality to the `cli` function from the `chainlit.cli` module. The actual implementation of the CLI commands and their logic is likely contained in the `chainlit/cli/__init__.py` file, which was provided as a related code snippet.

The related `chainlit/cli/__init__.py` file defines several CLI commands such as `run`, `hello`, `init`, `create-secret`, and `lint-translations`. These commands are not directly visible in the target file but are likely accessible when running the Chainlit CLI through this entry point.
