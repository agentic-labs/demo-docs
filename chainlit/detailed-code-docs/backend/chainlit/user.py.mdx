## High-level description
This file defines the User and PersistedUser classes, which represent users in the Chainlit application. It also defines the Provider type, which represents different authentication providers.

## Code Structure
The file contains three main data structures:
1. `Provider`: A type alias for authentication providers.
2. `UserDict`: A TypedDict representing user data.
3. `User`: A dataclass for user information used during login.
4. `PersistedUserFields`: A dataclass for additional fields for persisted users.
5. `PersistedUser`: A dataclass that combines User and PersistedUserFields.

## Symbols
