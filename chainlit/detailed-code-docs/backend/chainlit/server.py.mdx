Here's a high-level description and documentation of the `server.py` file:

## High-level description

The `server.py` file is the core server implementation for the Chainlit application. It sets up a FastAPI server with various routes and handlers for managing WebSocket connections, authentication, file uploads, and serving the frontend application. The server integrates with the Chainlit configuration, data layer, and user session management to provide a complete backend for the Chainlit chat application.

## Code Structure

The file is organized into several main sections:
1. Imports and initial setup
2. FastAPI app and router configuration
3. WebSocket event handlers
4. HTTP route handlers for authentication, project settings, and file management
5. Utility functions for serving the frontend application

The main symbols in the code are interconnected as follows:
- The `FastAPI` app is the core of the server, with routes added via the `APIRouter`.
- WebSocket handling is done through the `socketio` library, integrated with FastAPI.
- Various route handlers interact with the Chainlit configuration, data layer, and user session management.

## Symbols

### `lifespan`
#### Description
An asynchronous context manager that sets up and tears down the application lifecycle.

#### Internal Logic
1. Determines the URL for the application
2. Opens a web browser if not in headless mode
3. Sets up file watching for auto-reloading (if enabled)
4. Initializes Discord bot (if configured)
5. Cleans up resources on exit

### `get_build_dir`
#### Description
Determines the directory for the built frontend files.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| local_target | str | Path to local build directory |
| packaged_target | str | Path to packaged build directory |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| build_dir | str | Path to the appropriate build directory |

### `app`
#### Description
The main FastAPI application instance with lifespan management and CORS middleware.

### `router`
#### Description
An APIRouter instance for organizing routes.

### HTTP Route Handlers
Various route handlers are defined for authentication, project settings, file management, and serving the frontend application. Key handlers include:
- `auth`, `login`, `logout` for authentication
- `project_settings`, `project_translations` for app configuration
- `upload_file`, `get_file` for file management
- `serve` for serving the frontend application

## Dependencies
The server relies on several external libraries and modules:
- FastAPI for the web framework
- socketio for WebSocket handling
- watchfiles for file watching and auto-reloading
- httpx for making HTTP requests
- Various Chainlit modules for configuration, data management, and user sessions

## Error Handling
The server uses FastAPI's built-in error handling mechanisms, raising `HTTPException` instances with appropriate status codes and error messages.

## API/Interface Reference
The server exposes various API endpoints, including:
- Authentication endpoints (`/auth/*`, `/login`, `/logout`)
- Project configuration endpoints (`/project/*`)
- File management endpoints (`/project/file/*`, `/files/*`)
- WebSocket endpoint for real-time communication

The frontend is served through the catch-all route `/{full_path:path}`.
