## High-level description
This code provides functionality for comparing and linting JSON structures, specifically designed for translation files. It includes a function to compare two JSON objects and another function to lint translation JSON files against a "truth" structure.

## Symbols

### `compare_json_structures`
#### Description
This function compares the structure of two deeply nested JSON objects and returns a list of differences found.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| truth | dict | The 'truth' JSON object to compare against |
| to_compare | dict | The JSON object to be compared |
| path | str | The current path for error reporting (used internally) |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| errors | list | A list of differences found between the two JSON structures |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if both inputs are dictionaries.
2. Compares the keys of both dictionaries.
3. Identifies extra and missing keys.
4. Recursively compares nested dictionaries.
5. Checks for structure mismatches (e.g., dict vs non-dict).

### `lint_translation_json`
#### Description
This function lints a translation JSON file against a "truth" structure and prints the results.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| file | str | The name of the file being linted |
| truth | dict | The 'truth' JSON object to compare against |
| to_compare | dict | The JSON object to be linted |

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls `compare_json_structures` to get a list of errors.
2. Prints the errors or a success message if no errors are found.

## TODOs
- Support linting plural
- Support interpolation

## References
This code is referenced in the `backend/chainlit/config.py` file, specifically in the `lint_translations` function, which uses `lint_translation_json` to validate translation files.

## Dependencies
The code does not have any external dependencies beyond Python's standard library.

## Error Handling
The `compare_json_structures` function raises a `ValueError` if the input arguments are not dictionaries. Other potential errors (e.g., key errors) are captured and reported as part of the comparison process.

## Performance Considerations
For large, deeply nested JSON structures, the recursive nature of `compare_json_structures` could potentially lead to high memory usage or stack overflow for extremely deep structures. However, for typical translation files, this is unlikely to be an issue.
