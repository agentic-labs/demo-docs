## High-level description

### Try-Except Block
#### Description
This code uses a try-except block to attempt importing the `botbuilder` module and handle the case where it's not installed.

#### Internal Logic
1. The code attempts to import the `botbuilder` module.
2. If a `ModuleNotFoundError` is raised (indicating the module is not installed), it catches the exception.
3. In the except block, it raises a `ValueError` with a specific error message.

## Error Handling
The code implements a specific error handling mechanism:

- If the `botbuilder` module is not found (i.e., not installed), it raises a `ValueError` with a descriptive message.
- The error message informs the user that the `botbuilder-core` package is required for integrating Chainlit with a Slack app and provides instructions on how to install it using pip.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|

Note: The `botbuilder` dependency is not directly imported in this file but is checked for availability.
