Here's a comprehensive documentation of the target file `backend/chainlit/teams/app.py`:

## High-level description
This file implements the integration of Chainlit with Microsoft Teams. It provides functionality to handle Teams messages, process them through Chainlit, and send responses back to Teams. The code includes classes for emitting messages to Teams, handling user authentication, and processing various types of messages and attachments.

## Code Structure
The main components of this code are:
1. `TeamsEmitter`: Handles sending messages and elements to Teams.
2. `adapter` and `bot`: Set up the Teams bot framework.
3. Helper functions for user management, file handling, and message processing.
4. Main handler functions for Teams messages and events.
