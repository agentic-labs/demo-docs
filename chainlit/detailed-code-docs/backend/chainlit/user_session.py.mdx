Here's a comprehensive documentation for the `user_session.py` file:

## High-level description
This file defines a `UserSession` class that provides a mechanism for storing and retrieving user-specific data between calls in a Chainlit application. It also initializes a global `user_session` object for easy access throughout the application.

## Code Structure
The main components of this code are:
1. A global dictionary `user_sessions` to store session data for all users.
2. The `UserSession` class with methods to get and set session data.
3. A global `user_session` object instantiated from the `UserSession` class.

## Symbols

### `user_sessions`
#### Description
A global dictionary that stores session data for all users, keyed by session ID.

#### Internal Logic
This dictionary is used to persist user session data across multiple requests or interactions.

### `UserSession`
#### Description
A class that provides methods to get and set user-specific session data.

#### Methods

##### `get`
###### Description
Retrieves a value from the user's session data.

###### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| key | Any | The key to retrieve from the session data |
| default | Any | The default value to return if the key is not found |

###### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| value | Any | The value associated with the key, or the default value if not found |

###### Internal Logic
1. Checks if there's an active session.
2. Creates a new session if it doesn't exist.
3. Copies important fields from the context session to the user session.
4. Returns the requested value from the user session, or the default if not found.

##### `set`
###### Description
Sets a value in the user's session data.

###### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| key | Any | The key to set in the session data |
| value | Any | The value to associate with the key |

###### Internal Logic
1. Checks if there's an active session.
2. Creates a new session if it doesn't exist.
3. Sets the key-value pair in the user session.

### `user_session`
#### Description
A global instance of the `UserSession` class, providing easy access to user session functionality throughout the application.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| typing | Provides type hinting support |
| chainlit.context | Imports WebsocketSession and context for session management |

## Error Handling
The code doesn't implement specific error handling beyond basic checks for the existence of a session. If no session exists, the `get` and `set` methods will return early without raising exceptions.

## Notes
- The `UserSession` class is designed to work with both WebSocket and HTTP sessions, with special handling for WebSocket sessions (e.g., storing language preferences).
- The session data is stored in memory and is not persisted across server restarts.
- The code relies on the `context` object from `chainlit.context` to access the current session information.

This implementation provides a simple and flexible way to manage user-specific data in a Chainlit application, allowing developers to easily store and retrieve information associated with each user's session.
