Here's a high-level description and documentation of the `chainlit/types.py` file:

## High-level description

This file defines various data structures and types used throughout the Chainlit application. It includes definitions for input widgets, thread-related structures, pagination, feedback, and various other utility types. These types are used to ensure type safety and provide a clear structure for data passing between different parts of the application.

## Code Structure

The file defines several classes and types using Python's typing system and Pydantic models. The main structures include:

1. Input widget types
2. Thread-related structures (ThreadDict, Pagination, ThreadFilter)
3. Page information and paginated response structures
4. File-related structures
5. Message and audio-related structures
6. Feedback-related structures
7. Chat profile and starter structures

## Symbols

### InputWidgetType
#### Description
A literal type defining the possible types of input widgets.

#### Internal Logic
Defines a set of string literals representing different input widget types.

### ThreadDict
#### Description
A TypedDict representing a thread's structure.

#### Internal Logic
Defines the structure of a thread, including its ID, creation time, name, user information, tags, metadata, steps, and elements.

### Pagination
#### Description
A Pydantic BaseModel for pagination information.

#### Internal Logic
Defines the structure for pagination, including the number of items per page and an optional cursor.
