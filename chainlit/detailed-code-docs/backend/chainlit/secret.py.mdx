## High-level description
This code defines a function `random_secret` that generates a random secret string of a specified length using a custom set of characters. The function is designed to create secure, random strings for use in various security-related contexts.

## Symbols

### `random_secret`
#### Description
This function generates a random secret string of a specified length using a custom set of characters. It uses the `secrets` module for secure random number generation.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| length | int | The length of the secret string to generate. Default is 64. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| secret | str | A randomly generated secret string of the specified length. |

#### Internal Logic
1. The function uses a custom set of characters (`chars`) that includes ASCII letters, digits, and a subset of punctuation characters. Some characters that could break in the CLI (quotes, backslash, backtick) are excluded.
2. It uses a list comprehension with `secrets.choice()` to randomly select characters from the `chars` string.
3. The selected characters are joined into a single string to form the secret.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| secrets | Used for secure random number generation |
| string | Provides constants for ASCII letters and digits |

## Performance Considerations
The function uses `secrets.choice()` which is designed for cryptographic security. While this ensures high-quality randomness, it may be slower than using `random.choice()` for non-security-critical applications.

## References
This function is used in other parts of the codebase, specifically:
1. In `backend/chainlit/cli/__init__.py`, it's used to generate a secret for the `CHAINLIT_AUTH_SECRET` environment variable.
2. In `backend/chainlit/oauth_providers.py`, it's used to generate a nonce for Azure AD Hybrid OAuth provider.

These usages indicate that the `random_secret` function plays a crucial role in generating secure tokens and secrets throughout the application.
