Here's a detailed documentation for the `backend/chainlit/sync.py` file:

## High-level description
This file provides utility functions for handling synchronous and asynchronous code execution in the Chainlit framework. It includes functions to run coroutines synchronously and to convert synchronous functions to asynchronous ones, while preserving the context.

## Code Structure
The main components of this file are:
1. Type definitions and imports
2. `run_sync` function for running coroutines synchronously
3. `make_async` function (imported from `asyncer`) for converting synchronous functions to asynchronous ones

## Symbols

### `run_sync`
#### Description
This function runs a given coroutine synchronously while preserving the current context.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| co | Coroutine[Any, Any, T_Retval] | The coroutine to be executed synchronously |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | T_Retval | The result of the coroutine execution |

#### Internal Logic
1. Copies the current context
2. Defines a wrapper coroutine that sets the copied context before running the original coroutine
3. Executes the wrapper coroutine based on the current thread:
   - If in the main thread, uses `sync` function
   - If in a different thread, uses `asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe`

### `make_async`
#### Description
This function is imported from the `asyncer` library and is used to convert synchronous functions to asynchronous ones.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| asyncio | For running coroutines and managing event loops |
| threading | For checking the current thread |
| asyncer | Provides the `asyncify` function (aliased as `make_async`) |
| chainlit.context | Provides the `context_var` for managing context |
| syncer | Provides the `sync` function for running coroutines synchronously |

## Error Handling
The code does not implement specific error handling mechanisms beyond the default exception raising.

## Performance Considerations
The `run_sync` function uses different execution methods based on the current thread to optimize performance:
- In the main thread, it uses the `sync` function from the `syncer` library
- In other threads, it uses `asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe` to execute the coroutine in the main event loop

This approach ensures that coroutines are executed efficiently regardless of the thread context.
