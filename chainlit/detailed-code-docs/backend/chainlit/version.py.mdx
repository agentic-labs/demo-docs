## High-level description
This file defines the version of the Chainlit package. It attempts to retrieve the version from the package metadata, and if unsuccessful, sets it to an empty string.

## Symbols

### `__version__`
#### Description
A string variable that holds the version of the Chainlit package.

#### Internal Logic
1. The code attempts to retrieve the version using `metadata.version(__package__)`.
2. If a `PackageNotFoundError` is raised (which happens when the package metadata is not available), `__version__` is set to an empty string.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| importlib.metadata | Used to retrieve package version information |

## Error Handling
The code uses a try-except block to handle the case where the package metadata is not available. In this case, it silently sets the version to an empty string instead of raising an error.

## References
The `__version__` variable is used in other parts of the Chainlit package, such as:
1. In `backend/chainlit/config.py`, it's used to generate the default configuration string.
2. In `backend/chainlit/__init__.py`, it's included in the `__all__` list, making it available when importing from Chainlit.

This version information is crucial for compatibility checks, logging, and potentially for feature availability based on the package version.
