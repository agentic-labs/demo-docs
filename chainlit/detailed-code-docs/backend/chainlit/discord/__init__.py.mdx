## High-level description
This code is part of a Discord integration for Chainlit, a framework for building conversational AI applications. It attempts to import the Discord library and raises a specific error if the library is not installed, guiding users to install it using pip.

## Symbols

### `import discord`
#### Description
This line attempts to import the Discord library, which is essential for interacting with the Discord API and creating Discord bots.

#### Side Effects
If successful, the Discord library is imported and made available for use in the rest of the application.

### `except ModuleNotFoundError`
#### Description
This exception handler catches the specific error that occurs when the Discord library is not installed in the Python environment.

### `raise ValueError(...)`
#### Description
If the Discord library is not found, this line raises a custom `ValueError` with a specific error message.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ValueError | Exception | An exception with a message instructing the user to install the Discord package |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| discord | Required for Discord bot functionality |

## Error Handling
The code implements a basic error handling mechanism to catch the `ModuleNotFoundError` that occurs when the Discord library is not installed. It then raises a more informative `ValueError` with instructions on how to install the required package.

## Notes
1. This file serves as an entry point for the Discord integration in Chainlit.
2. The error message suggests using `pip install discord --upgrade` to install or update the Discord package.
3. The code ensures that the necessary Discord dependency is available before proceeding with the rest of the integration.
4. There's a small typo in the error message: it mentions "Slack app" instead of "Discord app".

## TODOs
- Fix the typo in the error message: replace "Slack app" with "Discord app".
