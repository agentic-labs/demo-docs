Here's a high-level description and documentation of the `backend/chainlit/logger.py` file:

## High-level description

This file sets up and configures the logging system for the Chainlit backend. It initializes a basic logging configuration with a specific format and sets the logging level for certain modules to reduce noise.

## Code Structure

The file is relatively simple and consists of the following main components:
1. Importing the necessary logging module
2. Setting up the basic logging configuration
3. Adjusting the logging level for specific modules

## Symbols

### logging

#### Description
This is the Python standard library's logging module, imported at the beginning of the file.

### logging.basicConfig()

#### Description
This function configures the basic logging system. It sets the following parameters:
- level: Set to logging.INFO
- stream: Set to sys.stdout (standard output)
- format: Defines the format of log messages as "%(asctime)s - %(message)s"
- datefmt: Sets the date format in log messages to "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"

### logger

#### Description
This is the main logger object for Chainlit, created using `logging.getLogger("chainlit")`.

## Side Effects
The file has the following side effects:
1. It sets the logging level for "socketio", "engineio", and "numexpr" modules to ERROR, which reduces the amount of log output from these modules.

## Dependencies
The file depends on the Python standard library's `logging` and `sys` modules.

In summary, this file sets up a basic logging configuration for the Chainlit backend, allowing for consistent and formatted logging throughout the application while reducing noise from certain third-party modules.
