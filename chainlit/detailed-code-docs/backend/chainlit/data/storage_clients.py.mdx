## High-level description
This code defines two storage client classes, `AzureStorageClient` and `S3StorageClient`, which implement file upload functionality for Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 and Amazon S3 respectively. These classes are designed to be used with the Chainlit framework for handling file storage in different cloud environments.

## Code Structure
The code consists of two main classes: `AzureStorageClient` and `S3StorageClient`, both inheriting from `BaseStorageClient`. Each class provides initialization and file upload methods specific to its respective cloud storage service.

## References
- `BaseStorageClient` from `chainlit.data`
- `logger` from `chainlit.logger`

## Symbols

### AzureStorageClient
#### Description
This class enables interaction with Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) Gen2. It initializes a connection to Azure storage and provides a method for uploading files.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| account_url | str | The URL of the Azure storage account |
| container | str | The name of the container in Azure storage |
| credential | Optional[Union[str, Dict[str, str], AzureNamedKeyCredential, AzureSasCredential, TokenCredential]] | The credential for authentication |
| sas_token | Optional[str] | SAS token to append to URLs (optional) |

#### Internal Logic
The class initializes a connection to Azure Data Lake Storage using the provided credentials. It sets up a `DataLakeServiceClient` and a `FileSystemClient` for the specified container.

#### Methods

##### upload_file
###### Description
Uploads a file to Azure Data Lake Storage.

###### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| object_key | str | The key (path) where the file will be stored |
| data | Union[bytes, str] | The file data to be uploaded |
| mime | str | The MIME type of the file (default: 'application/octet-stream') |
| overwrite | bool | Whether to overwrite existing files (default: True) |

###### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Dict[str, Any] | A dictionary containing the object_key and URL of the uploaded file |

###### Internal Logic
The method creates a `DataLakeFileClient` for the specified object key, sets the content settings, and uploads the file data. It then constructs and returns the URL of the uploaded file.

### S3StorageClient
#### Description
This class enables interaction with Amazon S3 storage. It initializes a connection to S3 and provides a method for uploading files.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| bucket | str | The name of the S3 bucket |

#### Internal Logic
The class initializes a connection to Amazon S3 using the boto3 library and the specified bucket name.

#### Methods

##### upload_file
###### Description
Uploads a file to Amazon S3.

###### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| object_key | str | The key (path) where the file will be stored |
| data | Union[bytes, str] | The file data to be uploaded |
| mime | str | The MIME type of the file (default: 'application/octet-stream') |
| overwrite | bool | Whether to overwrite existing files (not used in this implementation) |

###### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Dict[str, Any] | A dictionary containing the object_key and URL of the uploaded file |

###### Internal Logic
The method uses the S3 client to put the object (file) in the specified bucket with the given key and content type. It then constructs and returns the URL of the uploaded file.

## Error Handling
Both classes use try-except blocks to catch and log any exceptions that occur during initialization or file upload operations. Errors are logged using the `logger.warn` method.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| azure.storage.filedatalake | Provides classes for interacting with Azure Data Lake Storage |
| boto3 | AWS SDK for Python, used for interacting with Amazon S3 |

## Logging
The code uses the `logger` imported from `chainlit.logger` to log information and warnings. Successful initializations and any errors encountered during operations are logged.
